They have been linked to various diseases and conditions, including:\n\n* Increased risk of hypertension: Genomic variants in the NOS1 gene have been consistently associated with an increased risk of hypertension.\n* Ovarian cancer: The genomic variant of the TAG72 gene has been linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer.\n* Dysregulation of CD8+ T cells: A LOF STAT5B variant is carried by patients, leading to dysregulation of CD8+ T cells.\n\nGenomic variants can also affect treatment outcomes and have different effects depending on their location and the gene they occur in. For example:\n\n* Colesevelam treatment effects: A genomic variant in the KLB gene, rs4975017, was associated with differential colesevelam treatment effects.\n* Rare variants have been incorporated into the kernel function to improve power.\n\nSome specific genomic variants mentioned include:\n\n* c.3536C>G\n* rs142786317: c.*118_*119delCA; S1 Table\n* rs4149403: p.Ile7Thr\n* rs1576/rs130079/rs746647\n\nIntronic variants, such as the one in ARHGAP11A associated with sleep duration, are also a type of genomic variant.\n\nNote that some descriptions were contradictory or
