These variants can affect gene function or regulation.\n\nCertain genomic variants have been specifically linked to specific conditions:\n\n* A genomic variant in the PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 genes has a relationship with CD (specific details not provided).\n* Genomic variants in the FANCL, LCT, FTO, NOS1, HMGA2, BMP4, CHRNA3, MATK, and LPL genes have been associated with an increased risk of cancer, lactase non-persistence, obesity, hypertension, height, energy expenditure, and triglyceride levels.\n* Variants in the RPL7P3 gene on chromosome 9 were identified for accelerometer-measured light activity in the 5\'UTR region.\n* Intronic variants can affect gene function, such as an intronic variant in ARHGAP11A on chromosome 15 that is associated with sleep duration.\n\nSome genomic variants have been linked to specific diseases or conditions:\n\n* Patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygotes for a genomic variant in the LPL gene can present with marked hypertriglyceridemia due to this variant.\n* The rs4988235 variant has different frequencies in various populations, which may be relevant for understanding its effects on human biology.\n\nAdditionally, specific genomic variants have been linked to improved outcomes:\n\n* The rs12762549 (ABCC2 A > G) and rs1799793 (ERCC2 G > A) variants are associated with an improved
