These entities are described in the provided descriptions as playing roles in inflammation, influencing ovarian cancer risk, regulating cell growth and differentiation, being associated with dietary patterns particularly folate intake, and showing significant associations with various diseases based on genetic polymorphisms or genomic variants. The physiological processes implied by these transcripts include those involved in biological functions such as gene expression regulation, DNA repair, cellular responses to damage, immune response, lymphocyte subset variation, and activation states of cells following in vitro activation processes.
