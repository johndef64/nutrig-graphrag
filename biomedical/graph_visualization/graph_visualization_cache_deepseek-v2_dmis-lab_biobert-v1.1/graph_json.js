These genes play a role in cognition via BDNF influencing neural activity related to physiological processes affecting energy balance. They impact the risk of obesity for CDKAL1, regulate Folate metabolism through DNAJC27, directly impacting energy expenditure and appetite regulation through FTO gene. Additionally, they influence metabolic pathways modulating the risk of obesity indirectly by aiding muscle contraction via MYL2 or potentially contributing to obesity risk via extracellular matrix organization in OLFM4 and endoplasmic reticulum export in SEC16B. Specific genetic involvement impacting metabolic processes includes TCF7L2 gene associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes through its interaction at SLC30A8 rs13266634; PNPLA3 influencing lipid metabolism by affecting the expression of genes involved in this pathway. The ARRDC4, EPHA4, and FBXO32 contribute to cytokines signaling, TGF-\u03b21 signaling, and glucocorticoid receptor signaling processes impacting obesity risk. Furthermore, FOXO1 activation following cortisol exposure mediates a negative impact on neurogenesis by stress through its interaction with these pathways; HSF2 interacting in cytokines signaling, TGF-\u03b21 signaling, and glucocorticoid receptor signaling.

A genomic variant in the ALXO5 gene possibly rs1864414 has been linked to a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. The ABCC8 gene variant is associated with persistent hypoglycemia. In hypertension context, NOS1 alleles are found to increase risks for this condition. Regarding obesity, a genomic variant in GIPR (rs1444988703) impacts gene function and contributes to the risk of obesity. The TCF7L2 gene variants are linked with type 2 diabetes. Variations within the TUFM genes affect splicing regulation and transcription factor binding sites, while a variant in IL1A increases ovarian cancer risks close to TP53 for controlling cell cycle and DNA repair processes. In dental health research, genomic variants like those listed in Table 1 are investigated for their impact on Age at first tooth appearance and Number of teeth, specifically focusing on the NOS1 gene related to hypertension risk. Finally, studies around GPX4 gene mutations show a significant association with colorectal cancer risks while no significant association between Cdx-2 gene variant rs11568820 and ovarian cancer was found under dominant genetic models restricted subgroups of Caucasians.

"description": " The comprehensive summary for the biomedical entity PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS based on the provided descriptions is as follows: \n\nPhysiological processes encompass a wide array of biological phenomena, including those related to autoimmune diseases. For instance, genetic variants such as rs478582 in PTPN2 have been associated with inflammation in autoimmune conditions (1). These genetic variations can influence gene expression and protein function, thereby affecting physiological states within the body.\n\nAnother aspect of physiological processes is observed through differential gene expression between patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) and healthy controls. Genes such as AMPD3, CCND2, SOD2, TNFAIP3, COMP, WARS, ZIC1 show altered expressions in this context, highlighting the complex interplay of genetic factors affecting disease states versus normal physiological processes (2).\n\nIn relation to glucose metabolism, fasting proinsulin levels are part of broader physiological processes that include insulin resistance and may be influenced by various gene variants such as those related to the TCF7L2 gene which could implicate individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes (3). Furthermore, genetic factors in physiological processes like VEGF have been shown to play a critical role in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, crucial processes that are influenced by both genetic background and dietary patterns (4).\n\nThe maintenance of normal glucose levels can also be disrupted by genomic variants which suggest complex interactions within tissues affecting tooth development among other potential physiological outcomes (5). The nitric oxide synthesis pathway is another example where the NOS3 protein influences vascular function, with dietary patterns and specific gene variants potentially influencing ovarian cancer risk through their effects on this physiological process (6-8).\n\nFolate metabolism in its entirety also interacts with factors such as the NOS1 protein to maintain vascular function. This interaction points towards a broader range of physiological processes that are affected by genetic variations, including those related to CDX2 gene variant rs11568820 which may influence ovarian cancer risk and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (9).\n\nLastly, baseline CD4 counts represent another aspect of physiological processes within the immune system. These counts can correlate with disease progression and are considered a potential risk factor in multivariate logistic regression analyses (10). In summary, these descriptions collectively highlight how genetic factors influence various aspects of physiological processes that underpin human health and disease states across different tissues and metabolic pathways.", "entity_type": "PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS", "clusters": "[{level: 0, cluster: 4}, {level: 1, cluster: 9}]", "id": "PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS"}, {"source_id": "chunk-e8f81fdd25a22582c6ce3d1e15f74af3<SEP>chunk-938d8bf2e56584de9dd556be5eb70964<SEP>chunk-41c7131af28e2a745ef6b88b8601860f<SEP>chunk-84ec948f22126cef7d93b1d7465b79db<SEP>chunk-2c395e2fed68f9267c06e9fcee853aae<SEP>chunk-dcbd547f8218e7097805720fd6ea43ba<SEP>chunk-6cb127717713bd0ab5be9436fc0c7568<SEP>chunk-a321a6d63755366a1fc3eafbd9fbce83<SEP>chunk-45a965c3c3013c70d0fa0f1680283083<SEP>chunk-9a35876dc1aaf7342f023cab4f5b9914<SEP>chunk-f921f48a406901d82ec2e32af99485bf<SEP>chunk-8382a49b61215482f9fc75e3a86cb987<SEP>chunk-4b6e8f78911cafc70959cfdfed786c29<SEP>chunk-257a38a8ce6582c434f31b023b4a9704<SEP>chunk-f7bf38c7a21b86ad85fa360a21bfb447<SEP>chunk-0d155c005072e55d94179ce7952bf5a9<SEP>chunk-2b81371954b99facae9a0056e70aa7bd<SEP>chunk-2c91cdebb36ef064eb01a7021a961302<SEP>chunk-b6ea16f7f7eb8bc6f36f2be03fe62403<SEP>chunk-e1b4f4dac52e806f19c580640a50c729<SEP>chunk-1c470c93632f3704d6f3566de7a1dd0c<SEP>chunk-af413a33fae8d27bdb15cd18447dfad4<SEP>chunk-089bcdf055eb2f007db49dbe2409429b<SEP>chunk-dc5e8cc04a1b16b1e00f3a4120e004c4<SEP>chunk-4964b2db9e3ddddb4967fb7150e4404d<SEP>chunk-380a8a6e0d08cd28068a146ae5e00ce4<SEP>chunk-fde6653b9d9013ed054505cfe4cd1455<SEP>chunk-6f7ce1c71bd46f223756da44b0d0bb2c<SEP>chunk-54c4fede216a6c4183b95ee1a2edcb17<SEP>chunk-d4e04dd6cd6ea28f04fd72d964574ec1", "description": " The comprehensive summary for the biomedical entity DIETARY PATTERN is as follows: Dietary patterns significantly influence cardiovascular health, modulating interactions between folate intake and genetic variants related to nitric oxide synthesis.
