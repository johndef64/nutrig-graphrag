    "content": "Results\n\nPhenotype definition\n\nAll cohorts used self-report questionnaires containing ≥70 food items. Average intakes were highly similar across cohorts (Supplementary Table 1.2). Using these self-reports, we calculated the relative contributions of fat, protein, carbohydrate, and sugar to total energy intake. When possible, we excluded individuals on calorie- or macronutrient-restricted diets (see Supplementary Table 1.3 for all exclusion criteria).\n\nWe do not study total energy intake because it is mainly determined by body size and physical activity, and because systematic underreporting of total energy intake is correlated with BMI. We caution that selective underreporting of macronutrients could be problematic for the common approach we adopt of studying relative intake, but there is mixed evidence for this, and its consequences are poorly understood (Supplementary Information 2.4).\n\nSince macronutrient intake may not scale linearly with total energy intake, we developed and applied a method that adjusts for observed non-linear relationships (Supplementary Information 2.6–2.8, Extended Data Fig. 1). Consistent with the satiating properties of protein, we find that relative protein intake declines at higher levels of total energy intake, while relative fat intake increases, and relative sugar and carbohydrate intake remain roughly constant (Supplementary Table 2.3).\n\nMain results\n\nGWAS were performed in individuals of European ancestries from over 14 population cohorts. Informed consent was obtained by the cohorts for all participants included in the analyses. Association statistics underwent rigorous quality control according to SSGAC guidelines, which included sample-size-dependent quality-control filters, exclusion of SNPs with too small standard errors or too large explained phenotypic variance, and visualizations of summary statistics and allele frequencies (Supplementary Information 3.3, Supplementary Tables 3.1–3.5). Our discovery sample is the subset of the UKB with survey data on dietary intake (N = 175,253). The replication phase consists of a meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics from 14 additional cohorts that followed our analysis plan (N = 60,138) together with summary statistics from DietGen (for fat, protein, and carbohydrate, N = 33,531, flowchart in Extended Data Fig. 2). DietGen assumed a linear scaling of macronutrients with total energy intake. Nonetheless, we included DietGen in our meta-analysis because the genetic correlations between DietGen and our other replication cohorts are not significantly different from one at P < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 4.1).\n\nThe discovery stage identified 21 approximately independent genome-wide-significant lead SNPs (see Supplementary Information 3.3.5 for a description of the clumping algorithm): 4 for fat, 5 for protein, 5 for sugar, and 7 for carbohydrate (Supplementary Table 4.2). These lead SNPs partially overlap across phenotypes and reside in 14 unique loci. In the replication stage, all 21 lead SNPs had the anticipated signs and comparable effect sizes (Extended Data Fig. 3), and 15 reach statistical significance at P < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 4.2). This empirical replication record matches or exceeds theoretical predictions that take into account the statistical winner’s curse, sampling variation, and statistical power (Supplementary Table 4.1). In our data, the association between DRAM1 and dietary intake reported by Merino et al. does not replicate, with a discordant effect size compared to Merino et al. (, SE = 0.025 compared to Merino et al.’s, SE = 0.02 in phenotypic standard deviations per effect allele, Supplementary Table 4.3).\n\nIn order to maximize statistical power, all follow-up analyses below are based on the combined discovery and replication samples (N = 235,391–268,922, Supplementary Information 5). The quantile–quantile plots exhibit substantial inflation (λGC = 1.12–1.19, Extended Data Fig. 4). The estimated intercepts from LD Score (LDSC) regressions suggest that the vast majority of this inflation is due to polygenic signal, and only a small share is attributable to population stratification (the maximum estimate, ~6%, is for fat and is not statistically distinguishable from 0% at P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 5.1). The number of approximately independent lead SNPs in the combined sample is 36 (pairwise r2 < 0.01), including 6 for fat, 7 for protein, 10 for sugar, and 13 for carbohydrate (Table 1, Fig. 1). These 36 reside in 21 unique loci (Supplementary Table 5.4). Fourteen lead SNPs are uniquely associated with one macronutrient at genome-wide significance (P < × 10−8), while five of these reach suggestive significance (P < 1 × 10−5) for at least one other macronutrient. The SNP effect sizes range from 0.015 to 0.098 phenotypic standard deviations per allele. The phenotypic variance explained per SNP, expressed in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), ranged from 0.011% to 0.054%, the same order of magnitude as the R2’s of the most strongly associated lead SNPs for other genetically complex traits such as BMI and educational attainment (Extended Data Fig. 5).\n\nMAGMA gene-based analyses of our GWAS summary statistics identifies 81 unique genes (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 5.5). While the majority of these genes are near our lead SNPs, MAGMA also identifies 33 genomic regions harboring 44 unique genes that are physically distant (>1 Mb) from our lead SNPs.\n\nDiscussion of lead SNPs from combined meta-analysis\n\nSeven of the 21 lead SNPs had not been (directly or via LD partners, r2 ≥ 0.6 and distance <250 kb) associated with any other traits in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog at the time of query (September 19, 2017) (Supplementary Table 5.6). Each of these seven SNPs is located in or near genes that have not been studied in depth to date.\n\nFive lead SNPs are located in or near genes that have well characterized biological functions in nutrient metabolism or homeostasis but have not previously been associated with dietary intake. First, we find that a missense variant in APOE (rs429358) is associated with fat, sugar, and carbohydrate, where the allele that decreases Alzheimer’s risk is associated with greater relative fat and lower relative sugar and carbohydrate intakes. In addition to its strong association with Alzheimer’s disease, APOE is known to be involved in fatty acid metabolism. We explored whether the associations in our data may be driven by sample selection. Specifically, older people with dementia may be systematically missing from the UKB, and unaffected elderly people may have different eating habits than younger people. To test for this possibility, we examined the subsample of UKB participants aged below 60, where such sample selection should be largely absent. We find that the association is indeed smaller in this subsample, but the 95% confidence interval of the effect size overlaps with that of the effect size in the subsample of UKB participants aged 60 and older (Supplementary Table 5.7).\n\nSecond, a well-known missense variant (rs1229984 in ADH1B) that limits alcohol metabolism is positively associated with fat intake. The association is weaker in a sample of UKB alcohol abstainers (N = 39,679; Supplementary Table 5.7), suggesting that it may be partially driven by substitution of fat for alcohol.\n\nThird, one of the protein lead SNPs (rs13146907) is in KLB, which codes an essential cofactor to FGF21, which influences sweet and alcohol taste preference via the liver-brain-endocrine axis. KLB is only associated with protein in our GWAS and MAGMA analyses, while FGF21 is strongly associated with all four macronutrients in both the GWAS and MAGMA analyses. With MAGMA, we also identified MLXIPL (only for fat), a gene that codes a transcription factor to FGF21. This combination of findings suggests that different genes involved in the same pathway are important for directing intake of different macronutrients.\n\nFourth, an intergenic variant (rs2472297) that has been linked to higher caffeine consumption is associated with lower carbohydrate intake. There are various possible explanations, such as interrelated lifestyle choices pertaining to food and caffeinated drinks.\n\nFifth, an intronic variant in GCKR (rs780094), a carbohydrate-metabolism gene, is associated with protein. The lead SNP is in almost perfect LD (r2 = 0.94) with a missense variant that has been associated with lipid levels and type 2 diabetes.\n\nBioinformatic analyses\n\nAnimal studies indicate that the brain and peripheral organs interact in directing macronutrient intake. A question that arises is whether the “periphery”, which digests and metabolizes macronutrients, plays a larger role than the brain, for instance by determining how the brain assigns reward values to macronutrients. (For example, this is partially the case with alcohol, where mutations that affect metabolic capacity render alcohol consumption unpleasant.) While individual loci associated with dietary intake have been studied previously (e.g.,), it is unknown in which tissues the polygenic signal is enriched. To address this question, we used stratified LDSC to identify in which tissues diet-composition-associated SNPs are likely to be expressed (Supplementary Information 6.1). We performed two stratified LDSC analyses, which partitioned SNP heritability according to (i) 10 broadly-defined tissues, which were ascertained with LDSC reference data from chromatin data and (ii) 53 tissues (including 14 brain regions), as ascertained with LDSC reference data from sets of Specifically Expressed Genes in GTEx (known as LDSC-SEG). To correct for multiple testing across tissues, we used Bonferroni-adjusted significance thresholds for the number of tested tissues (α = 0.05/10 = 0.005 and α = 0.05/53 = 9.4 × 10−4, respectively).\n\nWe find that the central nervous system explains the majority of the genetic signal for all macronutrients (for the regression coefficients; Fig. 2), with the proportions of explained heritability ranging from 44% (fat and sugar) to 55% (protein). Within the central nervous system, we find broad involvement of the brain, including (frontal) cortex (fat and sugar), the basal ganglia (fat), limbic system (fat and sugar), cerebellum (protein), and hypothalamus and substantia nigra for fat and protein (and sugar only suggestively after Bonferroni correction). The confidence intervals for the coefficients overlap across brain regions, so we cannot draw conclusions about the specificity of brain regions for intake of particular macronutrients.\n\nFor fat, genetic variation related to adrenals and/or pancreas tissue is estimated to explain 37% of the heritability. Because the adrenals play a role in lipid metabolism, and the pancreas is crucial for digestion, either tissue may plausibly affect fat intake. We caution, however, that in the LDSC-SEG analyses of 53 tissues, all non-brain regions had P-values above 0.05 even before Bonferroni adjustment.\n\nTo gain insight into the putative functions of the top associated loci, we queried the 81 genes identified by the MAGMA analyses in Gene Network, which predicts Reactome functions for genes (Supplementary Information 6.2). In addition to neural functioning (e.g., axon guidance), we find that the MAGMA genes are predicted to be involved in growth factor signaling and the immune system (Supplementary Information 6.6). These results may imply a more pronounced role for peripheral gene functions than our stratified LDSC results, which mainly implicated the brain.\n\nGenetic correlations, heritability estimation, and polygenic prediction\n\nWe estimated pairwise genetic correlations between the macronutrients with bivariate LDSC. All are statistically distinguishable from zero at P < 0.05 (except fat and protein), but also from one and negative one (Supplementary Information 7.1, Supplementary Information 7). (As we explain in Supplementary Information 2.8, negative phenotypic and genetic correlations are not mechanically induced by our phenotype definition.) Thus the macronutrients have overlapping but distinct genetic architectures, consistent with previous work from animal studies showing distinct biological mechanisms involved in macronutrient-specific appetites.\n\nWe calculated GREML estimates of SNP-based heritability using a random N = 30,000 subsample of conventionally unrelated UKB participants. The estimates range from 2.1% for protein to 7.9% for carbohydrate (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 8.1). Our estimates are similar to previous estimates. These heritability estimates might be biased downward due to phenotypic measurement error (Supplementary Information 8.2) and are similar in magnitude to those from other complex (and also noisily measured) behavioral phenotypes, such as subjective wellbeing and risk preferences.\n\nWe constructed polygenic scores for the macronutrient intakes by applying LDpred to our GWAS summary statistics. We assessed the scores’ out-of-sample predictive accuracy in two holdout cohorts: The Health and Retirement Study (N = 2,344) and the Rotterdam Study (N = 3,585). The scores predict the macronutrient intakes with incremental adjusted R2 ranging between 0.08% (P = 0.088) and 0.71% (P = 9.11 × 10−7; Supplementary Table 9.1, Extended Data Fig. 8).\n\nRelationships with health, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status\n\nUsing bivariate LDSC, we estimated genetic correlations between our diet-composition phenotypes and 19 preselected relevant medical and lifestyle phenotypes for which well-powered GWAS results were available. We also included four additional phenotypes for which GWAS results became available after our study was underway, as well as Alzheimer’s disease, motivated by the association we found between APOE and macronutrient intakes, and nine phenotypes from the psychiatric domain. To control for multiple testing, we again used Bonferroni-adjusted P-value thresholds (α = 0.05/33).\n\nProtein exhibits the strongest genetic correlations with poor health outcomes, including obesity (rg = 0.35, SE = 0.04), type 2 diabetes (rg = 0.45, SE = 0.06), fasting insulin (rg = 0.41, SE = 0.08), and coronary artery disease (rg = 0.16, SE = 0.04), as well as BMI (rg = 0.40, SE = 0.04) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 10.2). Fat, sugar, and carbohydrate has negative, non-significant genetic correlations with BMI (rg between −0.06 and −0.02). For comparison, we estimated phenotypic associations between diet composition and BMI in four independent cohorts (combined N = 173,353) and meta-analyzed the results (Fig. 4). Protein (standardized  = 0.090, 95% CI [0.085, 0.094]) and fat (standardized  = 0.069, 95% CI [0.059, 0.067]) are positively associated with BMI, while sugar and carbohydrate are negatively associated with BMI (standardized  = −0.082, 95% CI [−0.087, −0.078]; and −0.084, 95% CI [−0.088, −0.079] respectively, Supplementary Table 11.1). Thus, the genetic correlation between protein and BMI stands out as large relative to the phenotypic correlations. The phenotypic association between overall protein intake and BMI is probably driven by animal protein, which has a positive correlation with BMI (standardized , 95% CI [0.15, 0.18]), while plant protein has a negative correlation between BMI (standardized , 95% CI [−0.08, −0.05]). These protein subtypes were available in four population cohorts with a total N = 15,347. No such large differences are found between natural vs. added sugar and saturated vs. unsaturated fat (Supplementary Table 11.2, Extended Data Fig. 9).\n\nDespite their relatively weak genetic correlations with BMI, sugar, and carbohydrate have negative genetic correlations with waist circumference (rg = −0.13, SE = 0.03, and rg = −0.14, SE = 0.03) and waist-hip ratio (rg = −0.15, SE = 0.04, and rg = −0.18, SE = 0.04) that are larger in magnitude and statistically distinguishable from zero at the 5% level. All the macronutrients have negative genetic correlations with alcohol consumption (rg between −0.61 and −0.11), as expected since alcohol is included in energy intake and our phenotype measures are shares of energy intake (Supplementary Information 2.8).\n\nNext, we computed genetic correlations with indicators of socioeconomic status, which are heritable and known to be phenotypically associated with food access, dietary choices, and health. We found that fat is negatively genetically correlated with educational attainment (rg = −0.13, SE = 0.04). Sugar and carbohydrate are negatively genetically correlated with the Townsend deprivation index (rg = −0.23, SE = 0.06 and −0.30, SE = 0.06), which is constructed from the rates of unemployment, non-ownership of cars and houses, and neighborhood overcrowding, with higher scores indicating more severe socioeconomic deprivation. These genetic correlations might hint at environmental factors involved in macronutrient intake, although these relationships might also be caused by unmeasured, confounding factors.\n\nFinally, we estimate the genetic correlations between diet composition and physical activity, which has widespread physical and mental health benefits. In these genetic correlation analyses, we used unpublished physical activity GWAS summary statistics from a sample of research participants from 23andMe (N = 269,189). The physical activity phenotype is a composite measure based on self-reported activities from leisure, occupation, and commuting. We find a negative genetic correlation of physical activity with fat (rg = −0.32, SE = 0.04) and a positive genetic correlation with sugar (rg = 0.23, SE = 0.04) and carbohydrate (rg = 0.13, SE = 0.04). The genetic correlation with protein is positive but not statistically distinguishable from zero at P < 0.05 (rg = 0.011). In the psychiatric domain, we find negative genetic correlations between saturated fat and schizophrenia (rg = −0.13, SE = 0.04) and between carbohydrate and ADHD (rg = −0.19, SE = 0.04). The negative genetic correlation with schizophrenia contrasts with its known positive phenotypic correlation, as patients with schizophrenia tend to consume higher amounts of saturated fat. The negative genetic correlation with ADHD might be related to ADHD’s responsiveness to dietary intervention, or might be explained by socioeconomic status."

    "content": "Results\n\nGWAS of self-reported walking pace identifies 70 associated loci\n\nWe performed a GWAS of self-reported walking pace in 450,967 individuals of European ancestry from UK Biobank (full details in Methods). The phenotype was coded 0, 1 and 2 for self-reported slow, steady/average and brisk walking pace, and the characteristics of participants across these categories are summarised in Supplementary Data 1. We used a linear mixed model with covariates for age, sex, genotyping array and 20 principal components of ancestry implemented in BOLT-LMM v2.3.3. After quality control 10,061,374 imputed variants were analysed (Fig. 1). We identified 144 independent significant SNPs across 70 genomic loci (Table 1), indexed by 75 lead SNPs (Supplementary Data 2).\n\nWe estimated an inflation in the test statistics (λGC = 1.597, mean χ2 = 1.767) but, similarly to other phenotypes analysed in UK Biobank, the LD score intercept of 1.058 (s.e. = 0.0120) suggests that the inflation is largely due to polygenic signal and the large sample size rather than population substructure.\n\nAs there is a clear negative association between BMI and self-reported walking pace (Supplementary Data 1), we were concerned that the results may simply reflect genetic associations with BMI, which have been extensively described. We therefore performed a sensitivity analysis by including BMI as a covariate in the model (Fig. 1). Of the 70 associated loci only 15 retained genome-wide significance following adjustment for BMI, whilst 45 loci in total maintained a suggestive significance level (P < 10−5). In addition, using LD score regression we observed a strong genetic correlation between self-reported walking pace with and without adjustment for BMI (rg = 0.83, s.e. = 0.0073), suggesting that much of the genetic component of walking pace is independent of BMI.\n\nPost-GWAS annotation, gene-based analysis and tissue-enrichment analyses\n\nA detailed annotation catalogue of candidate SNPs in the associated genomic loci is presented in Supplementary Data 3. Of the 70 independently associated genomic loci, 59 have previously reported suggestive associations for other traits and diseases (Supplementary Data 4). The strongest overlaps with the self-reported walking pace include 28 shared loci with BMI, 20 loci associated with educational attainment and 13 loci associated with hand grip strength.\n\nUsing positional mapping and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, we identified a total of 535 genes associated with genome-wide significant SNPs (Supplementary Data 5). We also performed a genome-wide gene-based association study (GWGAS) that identified 255 genes associated with self-reported walking pace (Supplementary Data 6), of which 152 were implicated through positional or eQTL mapping.\n\nThe strongest self-reported walking pace signals were identified within SLC39A8 on chromosome 4, which has previously been associated with metabolic traits, FTO on chromosome 16, strongly associated with fat mass and obesity, and TCF4 on chromosome 18, linked to neurocognitive traits and psychiatric disease. Of these, SLC39A8 and TCF4 remained genome-wide significant after adjustment for BMI, while the association of FTO was attenuated as expected but remained nominally associated (Supplementary Data 2).\n\nTo prevent against the potential pleiotropic effects of adiposity-related SNPs in the gene analysis, we further assessed genes that remained prioritised following adjustment for BMI. Of the 152 genes implicated by both the gene mapping and gene-based analyses, 78 remained significantly associated with self-reported walking pace following BMI adjustment. These genes included GDF5, ACBD4, H1FX, PTPN9, FAM83C and UQCC1 which have previously been associated with height; MMP24, NCOA6, PIGU, GSS and PLCD3, associated with lean body mass; MAPT, TRPC4AP, DCAKD, GGT7 and PROCR, associated with heel bone mineral density, and several genes linked to educational attainment and cognitive function (SDCCAG8, BTN3A2, TCF4, HIST1H4H, ABT1, TXNL1, NYAP2 and ZNF322).\n\nWe assessed whether tissue types from the GTEx database were enriched for differences in self-reported walking pace. Genes that were associated with self-reported walking pace had increased expression in the brain (P = 9.6 × 10−4) and pituitary (P = 3.1 × 10−6), with tissue-specific enrichments found in the cerebellar hemisphere (P = 5.4 × 10−7) and cerebellum (P = 2.1 × 10−6) (Supplementary Data 7).\n\nInterpretable SNP-heritability estimates\n\nTo provide an interpretable heritability estimate for an ordinal outcome, we parameterised self-reported walking pace on the liability scale. Self-reported walking pace on the observed scale y takes the values 0, 1 and 2 with frequencies πj for the three ordered categories. The underlying latent variable l ~ N(0, 1) is related to the observed scale through thresholds t1 and t2 in the equation\n\nThe heritabilities on the observed and liability scales are related using the result\n\nderived by Gianola, where zj is the standard normal density at threshold tj and Vo = ∑3k=1 k2 πk −(∑3k=1 kπk)2 (see Supplementary Note 1).\n\nWe used BOLT-REML adjusting for age, sex, genotyping array and 20 principal components to first estimate the SNP-heritability on the observed scale. Then, using Eq. (1) to convert between scales, we estimated the SNP-heritability for self-reported walking pace on the liability scale as 13.2% (s.e. = 0.21%). With BMI included as a covariate, the heritability is reduced to 8.9% (s.e. = 0.17%).\n\nGenetic overlap with other traits and diseases\n\nWe assessed whether self-reported walking pace has a shared genetic basis with other complex traits, which may reflect common biological mechanisms or causal effects in either direction. We examined genetic correlations rg between self-reported walking pace and a range of 53 traits using LD score regression. The traits were assorted into categories including anthropometric traits, cardiometabolic traits, cognition and educational attainment, and aging-related traits. We observed significant genetic correlations with 39 traits based on a Bonferroni corrected threshold (P < 9.4 × 10−4), with results summarised in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 8.\n\nThe genetic architecture of self-reported walking pace overlaps highly with traits relating to adiposity (BMI, rg = −0.52, P = 4.7 × 10−179), education and cognition (years of schooling, rg = 0.51, P = 3.4 × 10−170; intelligence rg = 0.34, P = 3.1 × 10−72) and longevity (parentsʼ age at death, rg = 0.54, P = 3.9 × 10−12). Overall, traits related to cardiometabolic risk, lung function, psychiatric disease and muscular strength show genetic correlations with self-reported walking pace. The genetic correlations also support many of the phenotypic associations that have been observed across categories of walking pace in external cohorts. Traits that remained genetically correlated with self-reported walking pace after adjusting for BMI included hand grip strength, measures of lung function such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), years of schooling, intelligence, insomnia and depressive symptoms. Genetic correlations with adiposity-related traits and glycemic traits were attenuated following adjustment for BMI.\n\nPolygenic risk score association with all-cause mortality\n\nWe explored whether the strong associations that exist between self-reported walking pace and survival can be explained partly through genetic predisposition. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the association of genetically predicted walking pace, estimated through polygenic risk scores (PRS) with a range of P-value thresholds, and all-cause mortality. We conducted our analyses using sex-stratified GWAS results for self-reported walking pace (see “Methods”) to control for sample overlap.\n\nWe observed a significant association between genetic variants associated with self-reported walking pace and all-cause mortality in males (PRS with P < 10−2; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92–0.97; P = 1.93 × 10−5) and females (PRS with P < 10−2; HR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.92–0.98; P = 2.70 × 10−3) (Table 2). We performed further analyses to examine the possibility of BMI acting as a mediator of the associations. When we adjusted for BMI in the model, the association with all-cause mortality remained significant both in males (PRS with P < 10−2; HR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93–0.98; P = 4.40 × 10−4) and females (PRS with P < 10−2; HR = 0.95; 95%CI 0.92–0.98; P = 2.24 × 10−3), which suggests the effect of the genetic variants on mortality is partly independent of BMI.\n\nMendelian randomisation\n\nWe performed MR to test for credible causal associations between walking pace and genetically correlated traits. We tested 21 traits for causal relationships with self-reported walking pace at a Bonferroni significance threshold of P < 2.3 × 10−3, using only GWAS data from large scale, published studies of European ancestry that do not include participants from the UK Biobank cohort. The 75 lead SNPs for self-reported walking pace were used as genetic instruments within a two-sample MR, with walking pace as the exposure.\n\nGenetically predicted self-reported walking pace was associated with a range of cardiometabolic, respiratory, psychiatric and sleeping traits (Supplementary Data 9). An increase in genetically predicted walking pace is associated with lower BMI (βIVW = −1.37, PIVW = 6.7 × 10−12), lower risk of coronary artery disease (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34, PIVW = 3.1 × 10−8), higher HDL cholesterol levels (βIVW = 0.95, PIVW = 3.3 × 10−9) and higher FEV1 (βIVW = 0.35, PIVW = 2.9 × 10−5). We found no evidence of directional pleiotropy by testing the intercept of MR-Egger analysis (Supplementary Data 9).\n\nTo examine the potential pleiotropic effects of adiposity-related SNPs on the MR results, we conducted two sensitivity analyses accounting for the effects of BMI.\n\nFirstly, largely similar results were found when we excluded 28 SNPs that were previously associated with BMI (Supplementary Data 10). Similar magnitude associations remained between increased genetically predicted walking pace and lower risk of coronary artery disease (OR = 0.37, PIVW = 1.5 × 10−5) and higher FEV1 (βIVW = 0.33, PIVW = 1.6 × 10−3), though a weaker effect was observed on lowering BMI (βIVW = −0.55, PIVW = 2.1 × 10−6). Associations were substantially weakened following the exclusion of adiposity-related SNPs between genetically predicted walking pace and glycemic traits such as fasting insulin, HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index) and type 2 diabetes, suggesting a contribution of pleiotropy that confounds the MR results in these cases.\n\nSecondly, we included both self-reported walking pace and BMI in a multivariable MR (Supplementary Data 11). After the inclusion of BMI as an exposure, only the association between genetically predicted walking pace and waist-to-hip ratio remained significant. This may suggest that the observed associations found between genetically predicted walking pace on lower cardiovascular risk and improved lung function are pleiotropically mediated through BMI. Alternatively, because the multivariable MR tests the direct causal effect of walking pace while holding BMI constant, the analysis may have limited power to detect such an effect when the causal effect of walking pace is substantially mediated through BMI."

    "content": "Results\n\nDescriptive statistics of the 12 anthropometric measures from both polities are presented in Table 1. As previously stated, all measures were adjusted for the effects of age and gender due to their correlation with body fat. The American Samoans had significantly higher fat-related measures, were taller, and significantly larger skeletal measurements except elbow breadth in comparison to the Samoans.\n\nTwo genotyped SNPs and seven imputed SNPs were excluded from the analysis due to low MAF (<.05) and deviations from HWE (P <.01). The pairwise LD plot of the remaining 51 SNPs was identical for American Samoa and Samoa (data not shown). There were no significant differences in allele frequencies between American Samoa and Samoa; compiled SNP statistics with comparative minor allele frequencies from Asian (CHB) and Caucasian (CEU) HapMaps are presented in Table 2. In general, Samoan allele frequencies were relatively closer to those of the Asian population than those of the Caucasian population. Of note, MAFs of the previously reported eight GWAS SNPs were significantly lower in both Samoan groups (0.161–0.239) than the CEU (0.292–0.478).\n\nWe tested associations of 51 SNPs with the anthropometric traits adjusted for age and gender. The analysis was performed separately for American Samoan and Samoan samples due to significant differences in phenotypic traits between the two polities (see Table 1). Thirty-six out of 1,224 P-values were nominally significant, though none were previous GWAS SNPs (Table 3; all data with the nominal P-values are presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Thirty-two of the thirty six nominal associations were observed in Samoan sample. Of these, 26 were associated with measures of skeletal robustness (height and knee, wrist, and elbow breadth). No significant association, however, was found with any SNP after correction for multiple testing. A combined analysis and gender-specific analysis of the FTO SNPs in the American Samoa and Samoa did not uncover any further associations (data not shown). Finally, a meta analysis was performed to uncover any consistent signals of association observed in both polities, but the results did not change (Supplementary Table 3). A second meta analysis was performed to combine the association signals of rs9939609 in both Samoan polities and the Tongan population reported by, but the signal remained insignificant (P=0.424).\n\nSince the majority of previous FTO reports have included BMI as the principal phenotype, we have estimated the effect sizes of nominally significant SNPs on BMI in the American Samoa and Samoan samples. There was no commonly associated SNP with BMI between the two polities; the effect size estimates for the two SNPs in Samoa (rs1861869, β =−0.347; rs7186521, β=−0.586) were lower than the SNP effect size estimate in American Samoa (rs1164281, β=−0.931). The confidence intervals of these estimates (Table 3) overlapped with reported point estimates in previous GWAS."

    "content": "Results\n\nCorrelation structure and cluster of anthropometric measures\n\nSummary statistics of the 11 anthropometrics and two derivatives (BMI and WHR) are listed in Table 1 for males (N = 360) and females (N = 483) separately. Since these measures are correlated with gender and age (data not shown), we first adjusted the effects of gender and age and their interaction term by linear regression. Unless otherwise mentioned, all data analyses were performed on these adjusted measures.\n\nThe anthropometric measures we studied correlated to each other (Supplement Table S1). Therefore, we first clustered these phenotype measures based on their pairwise correlation structure using hierarchical cluster approach. As expected, the measures that reflect “body fatness” (Wt, HC, WC and BMI) together with UAC clustered together (cluster 1). Likewise, a second cluster (cluster 2) reflecting “subcutaneous obesity” was represented by the five skin fold measures. Ht, WHR and UAW were outliers to these two clusters (Figure 2).\n\nGenetic association analysis\n\nAmong the 36 genotyped SNPs, seven were excluded from the analysis either due to low minor allele frequency (5 with MAF<0.05) or deviation from HWE (2 with exact HWE test P-value<0.01). We tested the genetic association of the remaining 29 SNPs with each of the adjusted anthropometric trait using the single-locus score test under additive model (1df test). The distribution and the pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) of these 29 SNPs are shown in Figure 3. Significant associations were found between several SNPs and various phenotypic measures (Table 2). Majority of these significant associations were between the “body fatness” measures (Wt, HC, WC and BMI) of cluster 1 and a set of highly polymorphic SNP markers (MAF>0.3) that are located between rs7206790 (No. 9) and rs1861867 (No. 27), which spans approximately 50kb. For abbreviation, we refer to these 15 significant markers as “body fatness” markers (highlighted in boldface in Table 2). These associations remained significant even after multiple-testing adjustment on the number of markers by permutation test (Table 2 and Supplement Table S2).\n\nInterestingly, UAW was found to be significantly associated with “body fatness” markers, although it is less closely correlated with the “body fatness” traits (Figure 2). In addition, one significant association signal was found between UAW and rs16952517 (No. 6, P-value = 0.00156, significant even with permutation test). In contrast, “body fatness” markers were less significantly associated with UAC (a member of cluster 1 traits) compared with UAW. WHR and two skin fold measures (TrS and SbS) of cluster 2 also showed nominally significant associations with some of these markers, significance of which were not supported by the permutation test.\n\nSince multiple cluster 1 measures and UAW were found to be associated with similar sets of SNP markers, we performed a principle component analysis (PCA) to evaluate whether some “lower-dimensional summary” of these variables provide more information about the observed associations. We identified three major components (PC1, PC2 and PC3) that could explain up to 90% of the total variance of these measures (Supplement Table S3).\n\nThe first component (PC1) explained more than 70% of the total variance and was approximately an average of all the included measures with similar loading coefficients (around −0.40∼−0.45), except for UAW (with a loading coefficient of −0.264). The association signals (P-values) observed between PC1 and the “body fatness” markers shared similar pattern with individual body fatness measures (Wt, HC, WC and BMI) and the highest association peak was found at rs1421085 (P-value = 0.000307) (Figure 4A). Therefore, we considered PC1 as a summary variable for “body fatness” and it well captured the significant association between individual “body fatness” measures and “body fatness” markers. To confirm this, we tested association using PC1 as covariate to remove the effect of “body fatness”. As expected, all the significant signals found between “body fatness” measures and “body fatness” markers disappeared (P-value>0.01) after the adjustment for PC1 (Supplement Figure S1). We also performed association test conditional on rs1421085 (the most significant marker) to investigate whether the significant association signals between “body fatness” measures and “body fatness” markers can be explained by a single locus. Again, after adjustment for rs1421085, the significant signals on other “body fatness” markers diminished (Supplement Figure S2).\n\nThe second component (PC2) had a prominent UAW constituent (with a loading coefficient of 0.935) and it mainly represented the effect of UAW with adjustments of other variables. Not surprisingly, PC2 was not associated with “body fatness” markers because PC2 was independent to PC1 and the later already absorbed most of the variance of “body fatness”. In this sense, PC2 could be approximately regarded as UAW adjusted for PC1 or “body fatness” (UAW|PC1 in Figure 4B), which was exemplified by the similar association pattern of these two variables. Interestingly, unlike the “body fatness” markers, the unique significant association between rs16952517 and UAW still hold for PC2 (P-value = 0.00531) and PC1 adjusted-UAW (P-value = 0.00372).\n\nSimilar to PC2, the third component (PC3) mainly represents the effect of UAC (with a loading coefficient of −0.878) and could be approximately regarded as UAC adjusted for PC1 (or “body fatness”) represented as UAC|PC1 in Figure 4C. Accordingly, PC3 was not associated with the “body fatness” markers. However, two novel significant association signals emerged between PC3 and rs11075986 (P-value = 0.00255) and rs16945088 (P-value = 0.00142). Similar association signals exist between PC1 adjusted UAC (UAC|PC1) and rs11075986 (P-value = 0.00211) and rs16945088 (P-value = 0.00203)."

    "content": "Results\n\nBaseline characteristics of the subjects in each cohort are presented in Table 1. A total of 2,954 SNPs (77.2%–91.1% imputed SNPs) covering the six targeted genes were meta-analyzed. A total of 45 SNPs located in the FTO gene demonstrated significant associations with obesity phenotypes using a Bonfferoni corrected significance level of P<1.68×10−5. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed that these 45 SNPs were in almost complete LD (r2>0.80) and were located within the same LD block of approximately 50 kb (Figure 1). Another 125 SNPs out of the 1,275 total SNPs spanning the FTO gene in the present study showed marginal associations with obesity phenotypes (meta-analysis P-values ranging from 1.71×10−5 to 4.99×10−2) (Results not shown).\n\n Table 2 shows the top 15 FTO SNPs associated with obesity traits. For most variants, little heterogeneity among cohorts was observed, except for rs9922708 for which moderate heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 43% and QP-value = 0.091). The direction of effects was consistent across studies except for three SNPs (rs9922708, rs17817449 and rs7206790). The trans-ethnic meta-analysis using MANTRA closely mirrored the results from the standard meta-analysis using METAL. The most significant association was observed for FTO rs7185735 (P-value = 1.01×10−7 for BMI, 1.80×10−6 for FM, and 5.29×10−4 for PBF) (Table 2), and allele-specific OR (95% CI) reached 1.20 (1.12–1.28) for BMI, 1.18(1.10–1.28) for FM and 1.13 (1.05–1.21) for PBF (Figure 2). The frequency of minor allele G at this imputed SNP ranged from 0.11 (Chinese) to 0.47 (Caucasian) in different ethnic groups. The forest plot for this SNP indicated that its strongest association was observed in QFS (OR = 1.51 for BMI, 1.49 for FM and 1.37 for PBF). Carriers of the G allele had higher BMI, FM and PBF values (Figure 2).\n\nFor the other five genes, 26 SNPs, 11 SNPs and 33 SNPs from CTNNBL1, PPARG and LEPR showed marginal significance of associations with P-values ranging between 1.50×10−3 and 4.94×10−2(Results not shown). The strongest associations for the CTNNBL1, PPARG and LEPR gene markers were: CTNNBL1 rs45500793 (P-value = 2.68×10−3 for BMI, 6.34×10−3 for FM, and 2.06×10−2 for PBF), LEPR rs9436744 (P-value = 3.16×10−3 for BMI, 2.33×10−2 for FM, and 7.55×10−2 for PBF) and PPARG rs10222537 (P-value = 1.50×10−3 for BMI, 1.19×10−2 for FM, and 6.77×10−2 for PBF). We did not detect association between any variants in the ADRB2 and UCP2 genes and obesity phenotypes.\n\nTo identify potential sex-specific loci, we performed a series of meta-analyses stratified by sex. In female specific samples, 25 FTO SNPs were significantly associated with BMI and FM, all of which overlapped with the findings obtained with the combined sample. There was no evidence of significant associations in the male specific samples (Table 3). However, a nominally significant association was revealed at rs16952725 of FTO in males (P-value = 6.87×10−4 for BMI and P-value = 8.55×10−3 for FM), but not in the female specific sample (P-value = 0.55 for BMI and P-value = 0.43 for FM) (Table 3). We estimated the statistical power at various locus heritabilities for the total sample, males and females (Figure 3). Our total sample and female sample have >90% power to detect a variant explaining >0.40% of heritability. However, the male sample only have 30% power to detect a variant explaining >0.40% of heritability.\n\nFinally, we examined potential differences of SNP association with obesity phenotypes among the four ethnic groups (Chinese, Caucasians, African Americans and Hispanic-Americans). In Caucasians, we found that 35 FTO SNPs were significantly associated with BMI and FM (P<1.68×10−5); 28 of these 35 SNPs overlapped with those derived from the analysis performed on the combined samples. The most significant association was observed for rs17817288 in FTO (P-value = 1.96×10−7 for BMI, 2.76×10−5 for FM, and 2.39×10−3 for PBF). However, these significant FTO SNPs in Caucasians showed no or weak evidence of association in non-Caucasian populations (Table 4, Figure 1). Therefore, the association results of FTO obtained with the combined samples were mostly contributed by the Caucasian group. For example, P-value was 1.01×10−7 for the most significant SNP rs7185735 in the combined samples for BMI, 4.90×10−7 in Caucasians, 7.47×10−2 in Chinese, 6.05×10−1 in African-Americans and 4.45×10−1 in Hispanic-Americans. In non-Caucasian populations, we only found marginally significant associations. Two FTO SNPs (rs7201444 and rs13335146) specific in Hispanic-Americans, 14 FTO SNPs and one LEPR SNP(rs9436299) specific in African Americans and one CTNNBL1 SNP (rs45500793) specific in Chinese showed marginally significant associations (P-value<1×10−3) (Table 4, Figure 1). Table 4 listed 2 SNPs specific in Hispanic-Americans, 15 SNPs specific in African Americans, 1 SNP specific in Chinese and top 15 SNPs specific in Caucasians. To assess genetic differences for these ethnic-specific SNPs (listed in Table 4) among the eight populations, FST were calculated. Nine FTO variants (rs1861869, rs7186521, rs17817288, rs8044769, rs11075987, rs9935401, rs8051591, rs7193144, rs8043757) and CTNNBL1 SNP (rs45500793) showed little population differentiation (FST = 0–0.05). FST of other SNPs ranged from 0.05 to 0.31, suggesting moderate/great genetic differentiation. FTO rs7201444 showed very great differentiation with the frequency of minor allele A ranging from 0.001 (Chinese) to 0.365 (African-Americans).\n\nIn addition, we examined the association of previously reported SNPs of the six genes among our dataset (Table 5). All of the 10 previously reported FTO SNPs (rs1421085, rs1558902, rs17817449, rs9941349, rs8050136, rs1558902, rs1121980, rs7202116, rs9939609 and rs9930506) showed significant/nominal associations with BMI, FM and/or PBF. Two PPARG SNPs (rs1801282 and rs3856806) and 3 CTNNBL1 variants (rs6013029, rs16986921 and rs6020712) showed nominal associations with obesity traits."

    "content": "Results\n\nWe analyzed genotype data for 520 cases and 540 control subjects, and performed a GWAS on obesity as a binary trait. We observed a strong association of obesity to the FTO gene, with the most significantly associated marker being rs3751812 (P = 2.01×10−8, odds ratio = 1.64). All association signals with P<10−5 are shown in  Table 3 , and the Manhattan plot is shown in  Figure 1 . No additional loci with genome-wide significance were identified in the GWAS; nevertheless, the fact that FTO readily reached genome-wide significance in a small data set confirmed the high quality of the phenotypes within the sample collection. It also illustrated how a small sample ascertained from extreme phenotypes have high power to detect genuinely associated genes, compared to quantitative trait association analysis conducted on population-based samples.\n\nConsidering the possibility that some obesity-associated genes may be enriched among the top ranked genes in GWAS, we next followed up selected association signals (∼500 top SNPs) by iSelect genotyping on 2,256 cases, family members and controls. Additionally, we also performed dense genotyping of 49 SNPs in the FTO gene itself, including 7 from the original top 500 and 42 spanning the entire gene. We used the MQLS software for the association analysis, to account for the familial relationships. Interestingly, the significance for FTO SNPs increased by several orders of magnitude (P-values range from 10−9 to 10−12), suggesting that genotyping additional family members increased power to detect genuine associations ( Table 4 ).\n\nWe next completed exploratory analyses of quantitative measures of obesity. In part because of the extreme bimodality of the phenotype distributions based on sample ascertainment, we controlled for case/control status. Moreover, this approach makes it possible to assess the potential effects of genes on the extent of obesity in extremely obese individuals. The complete set of results (P<1×10−6) were given in  Table 5 . We note that a few markers reached P<5×10−8, notably waist circumference (chromosome 21, rs11088859, p = 3.75×10−8, nearest gene NCAM2), and waist to hip ratio (chromosome 14, rs11624704, p = 2.67×10−9, nearest gene NRXN3), but the NCAM2 locus cannot be regarded as genome-wide significant considering the need to adjust for multiple phenotypes being tested. Therefore, these exploratory results were provided as potentially interesting findings worthy of additional replication efforts.\n\n Table S1 summarizes our results with respect to previously reported associations with obesity related traits. As noted, only FTO and NRXN3 reached genome wide significance. Three genes, including SH2B1, MC4R and KCTD15, showed trends towards significance in the case/control association tests (P-value ranges from 0.015 to 0.065), but they did not pass multiple testing thresholds (based on number of genes tested). For quantitative traits, we cannot estimate the power of our study, since previously published studies utilized population samples for quantitative trait association with BMI. Nevertheless, in our data, it is interesting to see that MC4R and FTO are the two genes with the strongest effect sizes (risk allele odds ratio >1.2), probably explaining why they were the first two genes identified in GWAS for BMI."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nTable 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the study risk factors. Smoking was relatively common with 28% of the women smoking about 6 cigarettes per day on average. About one in four smokers at pregnancy quit smoking during the pregnancy. Nearly 60% of women reported drinking sometime during pregnancy, and binge drinking was observed in about one in four women in the first trimester but declined substantially during the second and third trimesters. Thirty-two percent of women who drank alcohol before pregnancy abstained from using alcohol during the pregnancy. About 8% of the women were obese, and average BMI was 23.5 in the total sample. On average, women gained 14.6 kilograms throughout pregnancy. Excessive weight gain (according to IOM guidelines) was observed in about one-third (32.5%) of women, and 43.6% gained an inadequate amount of weight.\n\nTables 2, 3, and 4 report summaries of the SNP associations with the smoking, alcohol, and weight measures, respectively; detailed results for each SNP and risk factor are in Supplementary Table A1 online. There were several SNPs and genes related to the risk factors at p<0.05. Of these, 23 SNPs and 9 genes were significantly related to the risk factors after the gene-based correction for multiple testing. However, only 4 of these loci were significant under the SNP-based correction threshold. We summarize the results below for each risk factor category.\n\nSmoking\n\nOf the 733 SNPs in 79 candidate genes for smoking, 50 SNPs in 19 genes/loci were found to be associated with any smoking during pregnancy at p<0.05 (Table 2). However, none remained significantly associated with any smoking after SNP-based (p<6.8E-05) or gene/locus-based (p<0.0006) corrections for multiple testing. Similarly, none of the loci were significantly related to smoking status by trimester at the SNP-level corrected threshold; however, ACTN1(rs4902682), DBH (rs2519155), and rs3791729 (CHRND) were significantly associated with any smoking in the first, second, and third trimester respectively after gene/locus-level correction for multiple testing.\n\nSeveral SNPs were associated with the various measures of number of cigarettes at p<0.05; however, none of the genes/loci remained significant at the SNP-level corrected threshold (Table 2). The number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy among smokers was associated with 27 SNPs in 18 genes/loci at p<0.05 (Table 2). Of these, none were significant after adjustment for multiple testing (same thresholds as for any smoking). ACTN1 (rs181484 and rs4902682) was significant at the gene/locus-level corrected threshold for the average number of cigarettes smoked in the total sample (with 0 for non-smokers), and the number of cigarettes smoked in the first (rs4902682, rs2268968, and rs181484) and third trimesters (rs4902682). CHRNA3 (rs12914385) was significant at gene/locus-level threshold for the number of cigarettes among smokers in the first trimester.\n\nFinally, 35 SNPs in 19 genes/loci were associated with quitting smoking among those who were smokers at the beginning of pregnancy, but none of these were significant at the SNP-level threshold. Only two SNPs in FAAH (rs3766246) and DBH (rs2519147) were significant at the gene/locus-level threshold.\n\nAlcohol use\n\nOf the 493 evaluated SNPs in 29 candidate genes/loci for maternal alcohol consumption, none were significantly related to any of the alcohol consumption measures at the SNP-level threshold (Table 3). 12 SNPs in 7 genes/loci were significantly related to any alcohol use during pregnancy at p<0.05. Of these, one SNP (rs6035239) in PDYN remained significant after gene/locus-based correction for multiple testing but was insignificant after SNP-based correction (p<1.0E-04).\n\nADH1C (rs11499823) was significant at the gene/locus-level threshold for any drinking in the first trimester. Several SNPs in/near GRM8 were significantly related to any drinking in second trimester, any binging during pregnancy, and any first-trimester binging at the gene-level threshold.\n\nFinally, 15 SNPs in 9 genes/loci were significantly related to quitting alcohol during pregnancy at p<0.05; however, none of these SNPs were significant at SNP- or gene/locus-level corrected thresholds.\n\nBody weight\n\nOf the 285 SNPs in 15 genes/loci evaluated for maternal pre-pregnancy body weight, 22 variants in 5 genes/loci were related to maternal obesity at p<0.05 (Table 4). Of these, 7 SNPs (rs9941349, rs3751812, rs8050136, rs10852521, rs7190492, rs8044769, and rs9930333) in FTO remained significant after gene/locus-level correction for multiple testing (p<0.0033). Four of these (rs9930333, rs9941349, rs3751812, and rs8050136) remained significant after SNP-based correction for multiple testing (p<1.75E-04).\n\nFourteen SNPs in 3 genes/loci were associated with BMI at p<0.05 (Table 2). Of these, 6 SNPs (rs8050136, rs3751812, rs9941349, rs7190492, rs8044769, and rs9930333) in FTO were significant after gene/locus-based correction for multiple testing (same threshold as for obesity). Two SNPs (rs8050136 and rs3751812) were significant after SNP-based correction (Table 4).\n\nFinally, 15 SNPs in 5 genes/loci were related to weight gain during pregnancy measured continuously at p<0.05, but none of them remained significant after SNP- or gene/locus-level corrected thresholds. However, one SNP (rs2293084) in TMEM18 and another (rs2540766) in FTO were significantly related to excessive and inadequate weight gain, respectively, after gene/locus-correction."

In the replication stage, 29 of the FTO SNPs and 1 of the MC4R SNPs were statistically significantly associated with BMI (Supplementary Table 2). None of the initially-identified SNPs from the discovery stage were associated with colorectal cancer risk with adjustment for age, sex, and PCAs; after additionally adjusting for BMI, two FTO SNPs (rs8046502 and rs4784329) had p-values < 0.05; the ORs were 1.04 (95% CI: 1.00 - 1.09; p = 0.048) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.92 - 1.00; p = 0.048) for these two SNPs, respectively (Table 1).

    "content": "Results\n\nSequencing and mapping\n\nIn this study, we sequenced 95% of the entire human FTO gene and surrounding sequence, a region spanning 411 606 bases. The DNA was collected from a pool of 524 severely obese children and a pool of 527 lean controls (Figure 1). In total, we successfully sequenced 389 501 bases; the non-sequenced regions were excluded owing to difficulties in the PCR enrichment, which was primarily due to genomic repeats. After mapping, a high sequencing depth was obtained across the FTO region, with a median read depth of 17 385 and 18 385 in the obese and control pools, respectively. This corresponds to an ∼16-fold read depth per allele in each pool for 50% of the positions (Figure 3). Furthermore, ∼95% of all positions had at least 1000 in read depth in both pools, which corresponds to an average ∼1-fold read depth for each FTO allele in the pools (∼1000  alleles/pool) for most sites. The coverage correlates well for each position between the two pools (r=0.92), and the same pattern of coverage peaks were reproduced in each independently sequenced pool (Figure 4). Characteristic peaks were found close to the primers of each amplicon, with peaks reaching a maximum of more than 345 000 fold coverage. Therefore, both primer regions, and the overlap between PCR amplicons, were excluded from further analysis. These regions add up to 40 944 bases, which leaves 348 557 bases for inclusion in the variant calling and analysis.\n\nSNP calling and estimation of allele frequencies\n\nCandidate SNPs were identified in reads containing valid adjacent mismatches, as defined by the SOLiD system, and allele frequencies were estimated by counting the number of reads containing the reference allele and the number of reads containing the putative SNP. To remove potential false-positive SNPs, primarily from amplification errors during the PCR enrichment, we used a statistical approach to determine a threshold for the minimum number of UVAM required for a SNP candidate to be considered reliable (Figure 2). The UVAM thresholds were 21 for the obese pool and 23 for the control pool. This difference was caused by the higher coverage obtained in the control pool. In addition, SNPs were only called if they were detected in both pools, if the number of reads were distributed equally between the DNA strands (at least 23% for the strand with the lowest coverage) and if they were located outside of amplicon overlaps. Based on these conditions, 705 SNPs with a minor allele frequency above 1% were called, and out of these we found 19 SNPs that were not present in dbSNP(v132) and, hence, considered novel (Supplementary Information 2). In comparison, 5091 SNPs were detected when not applying the above filtration steps.\n\nTo test the validity of the UVAM filtration, we selected 48 high-frequency SNPs without first applying the UVAM threshold that had a strong obesity association for genotyping with custom-designed array. Out of the SNPs selected for genotyping, 25 were found in dbSNP, whereas the remainders were candidate novel polymorphisms. The genotyping failed for two SNPs (rs11076004 and rs3751814) and these were removed from further analysis. However, the genotyping clearly showed that all of the candidate SNPs not found in dbSNP were monoallelic, and thereby erroneously called SNPs (Supplementary Information 3). In contrast, when applying the UVAM filtration, all these false candidate SNPs were removed, which strongly validates the applied method. Among the genotyped variations found in dbSNP, four (rs11076004, rs28665159, rs34270264 and rs9928425) were found to be monoallelic. However, our filtration removed all these SNPs. Of the 17 true genotyped SNPs, four (rs1558902, rs12933996, rs9939609 and rs8063057) were removed as they were found in amplicon overlap regions or did not achieve good enough strand distribution.\n\nThe 13 genotyped true SNP correlations, between estimated allele frequencies from the SOLiD sequencing and the array had a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.76 (P<2.26 × 10−3) in the obese pool and 0.89 (P<3.25 × 10−5) in the control pool. Furthermore, the absolute error of the SOLiD sequencing was 5% and 8% (relative error 0.10 and 0.17) in the obese and control pool, respectively.\n\nIndel calling and allele frequency estimation\n\nSmall insertions and deletions (indels) were called with two methods: SplitSeek, which realigns unmapped reads from corona lite; and gapped alignments using bwa and samtools. Indels were only considered valid if they were called by both approaches and frequencies, were estimated from the coverage of the alternate and reference sequence allele that were achieved by bwa. With this approach, 13 insertions and 27 deletions were called, ranging from 1 to 9 residues in length (Supplementary Information 4). Sixteen of these overlap known indels in dbSNP, whereas the remaining twenty-four are considered potential novel variants. The frequency differences between the pools were very small, with an average absolute deviation of 0.6% and a Pearson's correlation coefficient equal to 0.999.\n\nThe obesity-associated variation pattern\n\nFisher's exact test was performed, based on the allele frequencies for each SNP and indel with an estimated minor allele frequency above 5%, to test for association with the obese versus the lean group (Supplementary Information 2). First, 22 SNPs from the SOLiD data were considered associated with obesity (P<1.14 × 10−3) and were found in three different regions of the gene: 20 SNPs were found within the well-known obesity-associated haplotype block of intron one; 2 in intron eight and 1 in intron nine. However, after validation by genotyping with a TaqMan assay, one SNP in intron one and one in intron nine were found to be monoalleic and were excluded (Supplementary Information 3). In addition, the two SNPs in intron eight were far from association with obesity when the calculation was based on the genotyping. All of the 19 candidate obesity-associated SNPs were found within a 31 794-bp-long region (hg18 chr16:52 357 478-52 389 272) that lies within the known obesity-associated haplotype block of intron one. Ten of the 19 putative obesity-associated SNPs from the SOLiD data in intron one were genotyped with the 48-plex GoldenGate array and analyzed for association with obesity using logarithmic regression and controlling for sex (See Table 1 for a summary of the association tests for all true SNPs associated with obesity calculated on the SOLiD data). Based on the genotyping, all 10 SNPs were associated with obesity, when not adjusting for multiple testing. However, when adjusting for the 44 haplotype blocks in the FTO region, 3 SNPs (rs55872725, rs11642015 and rs62048402) were associated (P<1.1 × 10−3). The SNPs, rs11642015 and rs62048402, were the top-associated SNPs, when calculating association tests based on SOLiD estimates and genotyping. No indel was considered associated with obesity, even when not adjusting for multiple testing (P>0.05). For results from the validation in Greek and Lativan populations, see Supplementary Information 1 and 5.\n\nBy using the UCSC browser, the genetic data were integrated with ENCODE data of gene regulation and DNA sequence conservation between vertebrate species, to try to identify candidate functional variants among the obesity-associated SNPs (Figure 5 and Supplementary Information 1)."

    "content": "Results\n\nTable 1 is the basic characteristics of the subjects used in discovery sample and replication sample 1. The basic characteristics of replication sample 2 are summarized in the previous research. Genomic control inflation factor of discovery sample is 0.976. In order to avoid potential population stratification, we used the inflation factor to adjust individual p-values. Figure 1 shows the logarithmic quantile–quantile (QQ) plot of SNP-based association results. After adjustment by the genomic control approach there is no evidence of population stratification is observed. Figure 2 is Manhattan plot of the discovery sample.\n\nWe identified 29 SNPs located in the FTO gene demonstrated associations with LMI in the discovery sample (p < 10−2). LD analysis showed that these 29 SNPs were in LD (r2 ≥ 0.91) and were located within two LD blocks (Figure 3). These SNPs were replicated in independent Caucasian replication samples (Table 2). Meta-analysis p-values ranging from 5.92 × 10−12 to 1.69 × 10−9. SNP rs17817964 is the most significant SNP with combined p = 5.92 × 10−12 in discovery sample and two replication samples of Caucasian. There are 6 SNPs with p value less than 1 × 10−11. Forest plot of SNPs with combined p < 1 × 10−11 was drawn in Figure 4. Regional plot of the gene FTO was drawn by LocusZoom in Figure 5.\n\nThe results of biological functional annotation using HaploReg v4.1, Regulome DB and GTEx are performed in Table 3. 25 SNPs may locate in a strong enhancer region marked by peaks of several active histone methylation modifications (H3K27ac, H3K9ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3). SNP rs17817288 (discovery p = 2.44 × 10−3, combined p = 5.44 × 10−11) occupies promoter histone marks in muscle satellite cultured cells. It was predicted to have enhancer activity by chromatin states, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks in skeletal muscle myoblasts cells and H3k4me1 marks in muscle satellite cultured cells. Besides it has promoter activity, implied by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac in muscle satellite cultured cells and H3K9ac in HSMM skeletal muscle myoblasts cells. Among the 29 SNPs evaluated with Regulome DB, 7 had no data. Of the 22 SNPs for which Regulome DB provided a score, 2 had a score of <3 (likely to affect the binding) including rs17817964 and rs7202116 with Regulome DB score = 2b respectively. Analyses using GTEx data reveal 11 SNPs of our GWAS results have strong signals of cis-eQTL for FTO gene in skeletal muscle tissue (p < 1 × 10−4). SNPs rs7201850 and rs8044769 were deposited in the GTEx eQTL database as a cis-eQTL for FTO in skeletal muscle with the same direction of effect (p = 1 × 10−5, Figure 6). Gene-gene interaction networks shows there are some connections between FTO and IGF-1, myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs: MYF5, MYOD1, MYOG, and MYF6) and IRX3, implying that FTO may play an important role in muscle development (Figure 7)."

    "content": "Results\n\nCharacteristics of the population\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the descriptive characteristics of the 998 students and staff from the University of Chicago and the University of Georgia included in this study. All participants are of European ancestry. Of these, 617 (61.8%) are women and 381 (38.2%) are men, with a mean age of 21.67 ± 3.31 years and mean BMI of 24.06 ± 4.61 kg/m2. People with underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity represented 4.1%, 64.3%, 21.7% and 9.9% of the sample population, respectively. The genotype distribution of the FTO rs3751812 SNP is 33.1% GG (N = 330), 49.1% GT (N = 490) and 17.8% TT (N = 178). The rs3751812 T allele frequency was 42.4% in our sample, which was similar to the frequency reported in the European subpopulation of the 1000 Genomes Project (41.4%). A total of 14 impulsivity parameters grouped into three categories (impulsive choice, impulsive action, and impulsive personality) are outlined in Table 1.\n\nAssociation of impulsivity traits with BMI\n\nTable 2 presents a summary of the association of 14 impulsivity parameters with BMI, adjusted for sex, age and site. Within the three broad domains of impulsivity (impulsive choice, impulsive action, impulsive personality traits), 4 parameters were associated with BMI. From the impulsive choice domain, delay discounting of rewards area under the curve (Beta (B) = −0.021 ± 0.009, P = 0.018), delay discounting of rewards average of log transformation of k index for large, medium, and small items (B = 0.011 ± 0.004, P = 0.004) were associated with BMI. From the impulsive action domain, Conner’s continuous performance test (B = 0.0008 ± 0.0004, P = 0.027), and from the impulsive personality traits domain, negative urgency (B = 0.011 ± 0.005, P = 0.030) were associated with BMI. As delay discounting of rewards area under the curve has a reverse relationship to impulsivity, the direction of the effects for the 4 parameters is consistent with a higher BMI being associated with more impulsivity (Table 2).\n\nAssociation of FTO rs3751812 with BMI\n\nThe rs3751812 minor allele T was associated with a higher BMI (B = 0.007 ± 0.003, P = 0.03) in the young adult population.\n\nAssociation of FTO rs3751812 with impulsivity traits\n\nTable 3 contains a summary of the association of rs3751812 SNP with 14 impulsivity traits adjusted for sex, age, and site. The same analysis adjusted for BMI was performed to test if BMI drives the association between FTO and impulsivity traits. The rs3751812 minor allele T was associated with 2 traits in the impulsive personality domain. These include lack of premeditation and lack of perseverance. When not adjusted for BMI, the P values were 0.009 (B = −0.050 ± 0.019) and 0.010 (B = −0.052 ± 0.020), respectively. When adjusted for BMI, the P values were 0.009 (B = −0.050 ± 0.019) and 0.017 (B = −0.048 ± 0.020), respectively. The direction of the effect was negative for both traits, meaning that the obesity risk allele is associated with more premeditation and more perseverance (Table 3). No association was found between rs3751812 and the remaining 12 traits, before and after adjusting for BMI.\n\nRelationships between FTO rs3751812, impulsivity traits and BMI\n\nWe adjusted the association test between FTO rs3751812 and BMI for sex, age, site, lack of premeditation and lack of perseverance, separately and together. The aforementioned association between rs3751812 and BMI unadjusted for impulsive personality traits was B = 0.007 ± 0.003 (P = 0.03). The association between rs3751812 and BMI survived after adjusting for lack of premeditation (B = 0.007 ± 0.003, P = 0.04), but not for lack of perseverance (B = 0.007 ± 0.003, P = 0.06). The association did not remain significant after simultaneously adjusting for the two impulsive personality traits (B = 0.007 ± 0.003, P = 0.05)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nThe FTO SNPs passed all quality control screening (see). Minor allele frequencies of the FTO SNPs ranged from 0.41 to 0.45. Missing genotypes were found for four AN cases in two SNPs and the difference in missingness was not significant between cases and controls (p>0.50). All seven SNPs satisfied Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.24 in controls). All pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (r2) values among the seven SNPs ranged between 0.81 and 1.\n\nTable 1 presents the uncorrected and corrected p-values for the most significant SNPs from the association analyses, accounting for affection status and the interaction between SNP and affection status. (Since all SNP pairs have high linkage disequilibrium, the results for the SNPs not shown are similar). The lowest uncorrected p-value obtained for all SNP analyses was 0.021, which corresponds to an FDR of 0.47, suggesting no significant phenotype-genotype association.\n\nAfter FDR correction for multiple comparisons, no significant associations were found for any of the FTO SNPs genotyped with eating disorder phenotypes or measures of trait anxiety, harm-avoidance, novelty seeking, impulsivity, obsessionality, compulsivity, or concern over mistakes, in cases or controls. Among the cases only, there were also no significant associations between FTO SNPs and the drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, or bulimia scales.\n\nGiven the preliminary nature of this study, we sought to inform future research in this area by exploring some of the non-significant trends identified in the current sample that may warrant examination in subsequent studies. In uncorrected tests, highest lifetime BMI was significantly higher for individuals with one or two copies of the rs7193144 at-risk C allele as compared to those homozygous for the T allele (p<.033). Similarly, lowest lifetime BMI was significantly higher among individuals carrying one or two copies of the rs3751812 at-risk T allele as compared to individuals homozygous for the G allele (p<.021). These results are consistent with the expected effects of these SNPs on BMI and obesity risk based on previous evidence; however, the non-significant corrected FDR values for these effects suggest the findings may be spurious."

    "content": "Results\n\nThe age of the 20,488 participants ranged from 20 to 85 years with an average age of 58.5 years across the cohorts (Table 1). The fraction of men included in each cohort varied from 0% to 43%. In all studies that included both genders, men had on average a lower BMI than the women. Participants in the Hypertensive Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) had the highest BMI while participants in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) had the lowest BMI. The obesity rate (defined as BMI≥30 kg/m2) across the studies was 46% ranging from 31% to 58%.\n\nThe targeted 16q12.2/FTO fine-mapping region spans 646 kb from 53,539,509 to 54,185,773 (build 37) on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q12.2), including the large FTO gene (411 kb) as well as 198 kb downstream of FTO, which includes the RPGRIP1L gene and 37 kb upstream of FTO (Figure 1). On average, we successfully genotyped or imputed one SNP per 172 bp ( = 646,264 bp/3,756 SNPs). The allele frequency distribution of the 3,756 SNPs in this region is shown in Table 2. In contrast to GWAS platforms, a large fraction of SNPs have allele frequencies <5% (52.5%), including 16.7% with allele frequency <1%. Twenty-one SNPs are within the exons of FTO and RPGRIP1L, of which 7 are synonymous and 14 are missense (2 synonymous and 4 missense are located in FTO).\n\nThe most significant SNPs in the 16q12.2/FTO fine-mapping region was rs56137030 (p-value 8.3×10−6), which showed no evidence for heterogeneity (p = 0.13; Table 3). Each A allele of this variant (allele frequency = 0.12) increased BMI by 1.35% (95% confidence interval (0.76%–1.95%). Table 3 also displays results for the three next most significant SNPs showing similar significant associations (p-values 1.4×10−5 to 1.1×10−5) and Table S1 shows results separately for each study. All three SNPs were correlated with rs56137030 (r2≥0.73 in AA and r2≥0.91 in EA; Table S2). rs56137030 and the three next most significant SNPs are located in intron 1 of the FTO gene, approximately in the middle of the region (Figure 1). The nine GWAS index SNPs previous highlighted in EA studies are also located in the same intron 1 FTO region and results for these nine GWAS index SNPs are provided in Table 3 showing p-values<0.05 for five out of the nine index SNPs (0.03 to 3.0×10−4).\n\nThe most significant variant, rs56137030, was correlated at r2>0.5 with 103 SNPs in Europeans (Figure 1a), including eight of the nine GWAS index SNPs (Table S2). In contrast in AAs rs56137030 was correlated with only 28 SNPs at r2>0.5 (Table S2, Figure 1b). All 28 variants correlated with rs56137030 in AA showed some evidence of association with BMI (p-values 0.0057 to 1.1×10−5) and no or limited evidence of heterogeneity (all p for heterogeneity >0.04). To investigate if any of these correlated SNPs were associated with BMI independently from rs56137030 we adjusted each SNP for rs56137030 (including rs56137030 and a second SNP simultaneously in one model). None of these variants remained significant at p<0.05 (Table S2). As expected, the p-values of rs56137030 were also less significant in these conditional analyses, particularly for SNPs highly correlated in AA, demonstrating that these findings are not independent. All 28 SNPs correlated with rs56137030 (r2>0.5) in AA are located between 53,800,954 and 53,845,487, spanning a 44.5 kb region about 104.8 kb downstream of the exon 1 boundary, and ending about 1.4 Kb after exon 2 ends [no variant in exon 2 was genotyped or imputed and, to our knowledge, only 3 variants (rs116753298, rs149393601, and chr16:53844100) all with allele frequency <0.1% have been reported in FTO exon 2 so far ].\n\nTo predict the molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic association signals, and to identify candidate variants for functional follow-up, rs56137030 and variants in LD (r2>0.5; n = 28) were assessed for overlap with eleven different genome-wide functional annotation datasets (Table S3, Material and Methods). Among these 29 variants, six (rs11642015, rs17817497, rs3751812, rs17817964, rs62033408, and rs1421085) were located within candidate intronic regulatory elements, including two (rs3751812 and rs1421085) that were within highly sequence-conserved elements among vertebrates, and two (rs11642015 and rs1421085) that were predicted to have allele-specific binding affinities for different transcription factors. Specifically, we predicted that only the T allele at rs11642015 binds Paired box protein 5 (PAX5) and that the C allele at rs1421085 has a substantially reduced binding affinity for Cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1; Figure S1).\n\nOutside the known FTO intron 1 region, we observed no strong evidence for a second independent signal: When we adjusted each SNP for rs56137030 the most significant SNPs outside of the FTO intron 1 region was a SNP located at position 53710931 (no rs number reported) intronic of the neighbor gene RPGRIP1L (conditional p-value 7.7×10−4) followed by rs8051873 in intron 8 of FTO (conditional p-value 0.0011).\n\n Table S4 shows results for variants highlighted in previous AA studies. Of these nine SNPs only two SNPs had a p-values<0.05 (rs3751812, p value 0.0012)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nThe obesity risk variants and their allele frequencies among controls for each ethnic group are described in Supplemental Table 1. Allele frequencies in whites in the MEC were similar to those observed in populations of European descent.\n\nAmong the MEC controls, we confirmed the positive associations between BMI and 13 variants in 6 loci (BDNF, FTO, KCTD15, NEGR1, NRXN3 and SH2B1) and also between BMI-adjusted waist circumference and 19 SNPs in 10 loci (the 6 loci above plus LYPLAL1, MSRA, SEC16B and TMEM18) (reported separately by the PAGE consortium).\n\nCases were slightly older than controls (Table 1). After controlling for age, cases were more likely than controls to have a higher BMI and personal history of diabetes, to be a former smoker, with higher mean pack-years among smokers, and to have consumed more alcohol. Cases had slightly fewer years of education and were likely to consume less multivitamins, dietary fiber and total calcium. Among women, cases were less likely to use postmenopausal hormone treatment than controls.\n\nIn the main effect analysis of the obesity risk variants on colorectal cancer, adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity, two out of the 24 SNPs showed a significant association (Table 2; results for all SNPs are shown in Supplemental Table 2). The KCTD15 rs29941 obesity risk allele (C) was associated with a lower colorectal cancer risk, whereas the MC4R rs17782313 obesity risk allele (C) showed a positive association with colorectal cancer. Further adjustments for BMI or for the risk factors that differed between cases and controls in Table 1 did not materially change the risk estimates (i.e., difference <10%). However, neither association was statistically significant when corrected for multiple comparisons, either by FDR-adjustment (adjusted p-value for both rs29941 and rs17782313 = 0.24), by case-control status permutation in sex/race/SNP-strata (permutation p-value = 0.056 for rs29941, p = 0.060 for rs17782313) or by the FPRP approach (FPRP = 0.650 for rs17782313 and 0.752 for rs29941, at a prior probability level of 0.01 and power to detect an OR of 1.5). Similarly, haplotypes estimated from the 8 FTO variants and 2 KCTD15 variants did not show a significant association with CRC (Supplemental Table 3).\n\nWe also examined individuals’ risk score by summing the number of risk alleles for the 15 loci (including two SNPs in low linkage disequilibrium (LD) for BDNF, rs8050136 for FTO, and rs29941 for KCTD15). The risk score, ranging between 4 and 22, showed a significant positive association with BMI (p <0.0001) but not with colorectal cancer (p = 0.47). The MC4R rs17782313 variant, but not KCTD15 rs29941, showed a slightly stronger association with rectal cancer (n = 444 cases; OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.10–1.51) than with colon cancer (n = 1,369 cases; OR = 1.07, 0.96–1.18; p-heterogeneity = 0.03).\n\nIn a subgroup (1,640 cases, 8,878 controls) that had 109 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) data available, the SNP-colorectal cancer associations were examined with and without adjustment for the four principal components that represented the differential AIMs patterns for the 5 race/ethnic groups in the cohort. The results were similar, indicating no evidence of population stratification (data not shown).\n\nBMI was positively associated with colorectal cancer risk (OR for a 5 kg/m2 increment = 1.19, 95% CI 1.12–1.26), with a slightly stronger association for colon cancer (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.29) than for rectal cancer (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.99–1.23), as reported previously. These risk estimates were not changed after adjustment for the rs29941 and rs17782313 variants (data not shown).\n\nBecause some of the obesity variants have shown different associations with obesity phenotypes by sex, race, or physical activity, we tested for evidence of heterogeneity. Results for FTO and KCTD15 that showed significant heterogeneity by weight status in some or all variants examined are presented in Table 2 (Phet <0.05). Three of the 8 variants in FTO (r2 of 80–95% in whites, 54–98% in the other ethnic groups) and both KCTD15 variants (rs11084753 and rs29941; r2 ranging from 31% in African Americans to 60% in Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians) had a significant inverse association with colorectal cancer among obese individuals, but not among normal-weight or overweight individuals. As in the main effects analysis, adjusting for BMI did not yield a notable change in the risk estimates (data not shown).\n\nThe SNP-cancer associations did not vary across ethnicity (see Supplemental Table 4), except for the NRXN3 rs10146997 variant, which was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in whites only (p-heterogeneity = 0.02). Similarly, there was no evidence of heterogeneity by sex, age (by median age of 70) or physical activity (by median 1.60 METs; data not shown)."

    "content": "3. Results\n\nOut of the twenty SNPs involved in the present analysis, nine showed no significant association with any obesity- or WC-related phenotype in neither of the populations under investigation (namely rs10938397 (GNPDA2), rs1137101 (LEPR), rs1501299, rs2241766 (ADIPOQ), rs17782313 (MC4R), rs6265, rs925946 (BDNF), rs659366, and rs660339 (UCP2)). \n\n3.1. Characteristics of the Study Samples\n\nAs shown in Table 1, a total of 2637 subjects were included in the analysis, 1496 and 1141 from the HG and HR populations, respectively. There was a higher proportion of females in the HR population compared to that of the HG population. The mean age of the HG group was higher than that of HR group, thus all calculations were adjusted for sex and age. Mean values for BMI and WC and the prevalence of central obesity (according to ATPIII and European and Asian criteria of IDF) were higher in the case of the HG population.\n\nIn addition, the HG population displayed a consistently higher frequency of central obesity, as well as larger waist size and BMI compared to the HR sample, independently of classification applied for abdominal/central obesity.\n\n3.2. Individual Effects of SNPs in the Hungarian General and Roma Population\n\nThe effect of the SNPs exhibiting significant associations with BMI and/or WC (as continuous outcomes) separately for each study population are shown in Table 2. Altogether, four SNPs (rs1121980, rs1558902, rs9939609, and rs9941349) located in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene showed significant association with WC (as a continuous outcome) in both populations. The same four SNPs also showed a significant positive association with BMI in the HG population, and only two of them (rs9939609 and rs9941349) in the Roma population. \n\nThe rs1801282, located in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) gene, was significantly associated with decreased waist circumference as a continuous outcome only in the HR population (HG: β = 0.340, SE: 0.724, p = 0.638; HR β = –3.507, SE: 1.699, p = 0.039; p = 0.029 for difference in association). This SNP had a large protective effect against increased WC but did not have any significant effect on BMI in the HR population. A protective effect of this extent was not observed for any of the obesity phenotypes in the HG sample. Effect sizes for WC were consistently stronger in both populations, compared to generalized obesity, suggesting that the risk for obesity in both populations is primarily dependent on abdominal obesity.\n\nFurther comparisons (Figure 1) were made by computing ORs for obesity (Figure 1A), WC by ATPIII (Figure 1B) and WC by IDFEURO (Figure 1C), and IDFASIA (Figure 1D). When comparing associations of SNPs for obesity (Figure 1A), all four FTO variants displayed a similar significant association in both the HG and HR groups. rs16139 in the neuropeptide Y gene (NPY) had a significant effect on obesity (Figure 1A) only in the HG, while all other SNPs showed no association with obesity in either population. In the case of the WC ATPIII phenotype (Figure 1B), three SNPs (rs1558902, rs9939609, and rs9941349 in FTO) showed a significant effect in HR population (Figure 1B) and one (rs12970134 which is localized near the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene), had a significant effect on WC in the HG population (Figure 1B).\n\nComparisons based on IDFEURO (Figure 1C) showed two SNPs (rs2867125 and rs6548238—located in the transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18) gene) significantly associated with WC in HG. In the case of IDFASIA (Figure 1D), no significant association was observed in HR. A summary of SNPs associated with obesity- and WC-related phenotypes as continuous outcomes, is presented in the supplementary Figure S3.\n\n3.3. The Results of Different Genetic Models for the rs1801282 Gene Polymorphism in PPARγ\n\nWe used four genetic models (i.e., codominant, dominant, recessive, and over-dominant) to further examine the effect of the rs1801282 in PPARγ on the WC as a continuous outcome (Table 3). There was a significant association between SNP and outcome in the Roma population with a dominant genetic model. Furthermore, it was found that the direction of the effect of the rs1801282 differed in both study populations regardless of the genetic model. No significant difference in the risk susceptibility for this SNP was observed, with or without obesity phenotypes among HG or HR, when considering other generalized and centralized obesity criteria in further genetic models (Tables S6–S9).\n\nFor PPARγ SNP (rs1801282) the allelic frequency was significantly higher among Roma (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 2.18–3.46), with ethnicity status as an outcome."

Among these 52 SNPs, rs8050136 (p-value = 7.80 × 10− 10), rs9939609 (p-value = 1.32 × 10− 9), rs1421085 (p-value = 1.54 × 10− 8), rs9941349 (p-value = 9.05 × 10− 8), rs1121980 (p-value = 7.27 × 10− 7), and rs9937354 (p-value = 6.65 × 10− 7) were the top ranking SNPs, and all located in the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) block (Additional file 1: Figure S1) in the intron 1 of FTO gene. Nine additional SNPs showed statistical significance using the Bonferroni correction criteria (p-value < 9.6 × 10− 4 [0.05/52]). Seven SNPs flanked six loci as follows: RBFOX1 (rs12925846 [p-value = 6.21 × 10− 6], and rs17235335 [p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5]), RP11-638 L3.1 (rs2126015, p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5), TMTC1 (rs159702, p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5), CBLN4 (rs6069477, p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5), CSMD3 (rs16883931, p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5), and ERBB4 (rs6757087, p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5). Two SNPs, rs11626956 (p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5), and rs9808434 (p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5) were located in an intergenic region."

    "content": "Results\n\nSelected baseline characteristics of cases and controls\n\nTable 1 summarizes selected baseline characteristics of cases and controls. Cases were more likely to be overweight, and also tended to have more experience with smoking and a family history of colorectal cancer than controls. Table 1 also shows plasma concentrations of three adipokines among cases and controls. Although there was no material difference between the two groups, controls tended to have higher plasma concentrations of total and HMW adiponectin than cases.\n\nAssociation of SNPs in the FTO gene with the risk of colorectal cancer\n\nPrior to investigating the association between the eight candidate SNPs of the FTO gene and the risk of colorectal cancer, we first tested whether genotype frequencies among controls were consistent with those predicted under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using the χ2 test statistics, and found no inconsistency except for rs6499640 (P HWE = 0.01). We then conducted a haplotype analysis excluding rs6499640, and found that the remaining seven SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium with R2> 0.8 (Fig 2). As highly expected, all seven SNPs in the FTO gene demonstrated a similar positive association with the incidence of colorectal cancer (Table 2), and most evidently for rs1558902, rs8050136, rs3751812, and rs9939609 (Ptrend = 0.02). In the case of rs8050136, carriers of the obesity risk A allele had a 36% elevated risk for colorectal cancer (95% CI, 2–83%) compared to non-carriers.\n\nAssociation of pre-diagnostic plasma adipokine levels with the risk of colorectal cancer\n\nTable 3 shows the association between plasma concentrations of the three adipokines and the risk colorectal cancer. Plasma leptin levels were positively associated with the incidence of colorectal cancer (Ptrend = 0.04), with a multivariate adjusted OR of colorectal cancer for the highest compared to the lowest quintile of 1.80 (95% CI, 1.12–2.88). In contrast, a non-linear inverse association was suggested for total and HMW adiponectin (Ptrend = 0.10 and 0.13, respectively): using the first quintile as reference, the second presented a decrease in the multivariate adjusted OR of colorectal cancer, whereas the third to fifth presented no further decline. Additional adjustment for BMI considerably attenuated the associations of plasma adipokines with the risk of colorectal cancer, but an elevated risk was still statistically significant for plasma leptin levels. Compared to the lowest quintile of plasma leptin, the highest demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the BMI-adjusted OR of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.00–3.16; P = 0.04).\n\nInteraction between SNPs in the FTO gene and pre-diagnostic plasma adipokine levels on colorectal cancer risk\n\nFinally, we investigated the interaction between SNPs in the FTO gene and plasma adipokine levels on colorectal cancer risk. In Table 4, we presented the results of rs8050136 only, because rs8050136 and the other six SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium, and all demonstrated closely similar results. Compared to non-carriers in the lowest quintile of leptin, carriers of the obesity risk A allele in the highest quintile had a substantially increased risk of colorectal cancer (multivariate adjusted OR = 2.55; 95% CI, 1.21–5.39), although the interaction was not statistically significant (Pinteraction = 0.30). Of interest, we observed a statistically significant interaction of rs8050136 with total adiponectin (Pinteraction = 0.03), but only a marginal interaction with HMW adiponectin (Pinteraction = 0.16). Compared to non-carriers in the lowest quintile of total adiponectin, carriers of the obesity risk A allele in the same quintile showed a considerably elevated risk of colorectal cancer with the multivariate adjusted OR of 2.54 (95% CI, 1.36–4.75), while the corresponding OR was 2.18 (95% CI, 1.14–4.16) for HMW adiponectin."

    "content": "Results\n\nOverview of analyses\n\nAll continuous measures were first examined for distributional properties. Only epinephrine exhibited a significant departure from normality. The raw values were log transformed, and the log transformed values were used in all subsequent analyses. Since all analyses were planned a priori, and because of the difficulty in detecting interactions in field studies, critical alpha was maintained at .05 for all analyses. We first explored demographics and baseline physical activity to assess the success of random assignment. We then conducted attrition analyses to determine whether differential attrition generally or by condition occurred across the course of the study. Missing data were approached via the use of full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation, whereby all possible data points are utilized and missing values are iteratively estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Analyses on intervention outcomes were conducted in a random coefficient regression (RCR) framework via SAS Proc Mixed, which takes into account the longitudinal nature of the data and implements FIML estimation of missing data within the analysis. Moderator analyses were also conducted in a RCR framework.\n\nDemographics\n\nDuring the baseline assessment, 19 individuals reported more than 90 minutes of voluntary physical activity in the past week according to the PAR assessment. These individuals were not considered “inactive” and were therefore dropped from the analysis. Thus, the sample used here included 219 individuals. Table 1 provides baseline characteristics across the two intervention groups and outcome variables at 12-months. On average, the sample was 28.20 years of age (sd = 7.95). The majority were White (67.1%), were predominantly female (80.4%), had an average of 15.83 years of education (sd = 2.60), and more than half had a total household income of $50,000 or more (55.2%). Participants reported engaging in 17.58 minutes (sd = 26.58) of at least moderate-intensity exercise over the past week, with a majority (59.8%) being completely sedentary and half (50%) fell into the normal weight range on BMI (18.5-24.9). There were no significant differences between the groups on any baseline demographic data.\n\nAttrition\n\nAttrition analyses were conducted with regard to who was retained versus not retained at the 12-month follow-up. To examine whether there were differential rates of attrition by condition, a series of ANOVAs were conducted to examine the interaction between attrition at 12-month follow-up (retained vs. not retained) and condition (COSTRIDE versus HW) on pretest measures of key demographic and behavioral constructs. Of 13 tests conducted, there were only two significant effects. Participants with lower levels of self-reported frequency of exercise at baseline were significantly more likely to be retained at the 12-month follow-up ( p = .004), although this did not differ by condition and baseline levels of behavior are included in every analysis of behavior change over the trial. There was also a significant retentionXcondition interaction for gender, such that males were less likely to be retained in the HW condition (p = .02). Thus all main intervention analyses on outcomes were repeated controlling for gender.\n\nMain effects of the intervention on physical activity outcomes\n\nPAR minutes\n\nIn the first analysis, PAR minutes reported at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months served as the dependent measure, and condition (COSTRIDE versus HW) and time were the independent variables. There was a significant timeXcondition interaction on PAR minutes (est. = 14.85, se = 7.47, p = .047). Participants in both conditions increased their moderate intensity physical activity minutes from baseline to 6 months, but those in the COSTRIDE condition appeared better able to maintain those gains from the 6-month to 12-month follow-up (see Figure 3). Simple effects tests confirmed that the COSTRIDE and HW conditions were not different in PAR minutes at the 6 months, but this difference was significant at 12 months (p = .02). Outcomes were unchanged after controlling for gender.\n\nFrequency of aerobic exercise\n\nIn the second analysis, past 3-month frequency of exercise reported at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months served as the dependent measure. There was a significant timeXcondition interaction on frequency of exercise (est. = .09, se = .03, p = .006). Participants in the COSTRIDE condition increased their frequency of exercise from baseline to 3 months and then maintained that change over time, while participants in the HW condition actually decreased their frequency of exercise from baseline to 3 months and, similarly, maintained that behavior (see Figure 4). Simple effects tests confirmed that the COSTRIDE and HW conditions were not different in reported frequency of exercise at baseline, nor at the 9 month follow-up. However, the conditions were significantly different at the 3 month (p = .002), 6 month (p = .02), and 12-month assessments (p = .004). The significant intervention effect was unchanged after controlling for gender.\n\nVO2 max\n\nVO2 max at baseline and then at 12 months served as the dependent measure. There was no significant timeXcondition interaction on VO2max (est. = .30, se = .52, p = .55). In the HW condition, VO2 max went from a mean of 33.23 ml/kg/min (sd = 7.10) at baseline to a mean of 33.39 ml/kg/min (sd = 7.57) at 12 months. In the COSTRIDE condition, VO2 max went from a mean of 34.06 ml/kg/min (sd = 8.16) at baseline to a mean of 34.92 ml/kg/min (sd = 8.49) at 12 months.\n\nThe three outcome measures were most certainly assessing three different, though related, dimensions of physical activity. The correlations between outcomes before and after 12 months of participation in COSTRIDE or HW were high for the self-reported outcomes, but much smaller for VO2 max. At both baseline and 12-month follow-up, past 7-day PAR minutes was significantly and positively associated with past 3-month frequency of exercise (r = .20, p = 004 and r = .64, p < .001, respectively) and VO2 max (r = .15, p = .03 and r = .29, p < .001, respectively). Frequency of exercise was not associated with VO2 max at baseline (r = .08), but was significantly and positively associated at 12 months (r = .24, p = .002).\n\nModeration of intervention effects on physical activity outcomes\n\nFor each moderator tested, we estimated a RCR wherein condition, time, the moderator (centered when necessary), and all possible interactions served as the independent variables. The test of primary interest in these analyses is the timeXconditionXmoderator interaction.\n\nGenetic factors\n\nThe BDNF SNP (rs6265) did not moderate the intervention effects on past 7-day PAR minutes, but it did moderate intervention effects on past 3-month frequency of exercise (est. = .14, se = .069, p < .05). COSTRIDE participants with two copies of the G allele exercised less frequently in the past three months than individuals with at least one copy of the A allele, while individuals with an A allele in the HW condition were the least active (Figure 5). There was no moderation of intervention effects on VO2 max by the BDNF SNP, however there was a marginal main effect of the SNP on overall levels of VO2 max (est. = 3.06, se = 1.59, p = .056). The estimated means indicated that A/A and A/G individuals had higher overall VO2 max (M = 34.99, se = .84) than G/G individuals (M = 33.58, se = .64). There was no moderation of intervention effects on 7-day PAR minutes by a SNP in the FTO gene (rs8044769). However, there was evidence for the moderation of intervention effects on past 3-month frequency of exercise by this FTO SNP (est. = -.15, se = .076, p = .05). COSTRIDE participants with two copies of the C allele exercised more frequently, while individuals with at least one copy of the T allele exercised less frequently (Figure 6). There was no moderation of intervention effects on VO2 max by this FTO SNP. Additionally, there was no moderation of intervention effects on PAR minutes, voluntary aerobic exercise, or VO2 max by the other SNPs examined.\n\nPhysiological responses to exercise\n\nIn order to explore the extent to which physiological responses to exercise moderated intervention outcomes, it was necessary to compute slopes that characterized the response during exercise for each of our physiological moderators. We utilized a RCR framework in SAS Version 9.2 to model linear changes in the response over the course of the submaximal exercise challenge. These analyses produced individual within-subject regression slopes that characterized each individual’s change in, for example, heart rate over the course of the bout of exercise. These slopes then served as an additional predictor in the overall RCR models assessing intervention effects. There was no significant moderation of intervention effects on past 7-day PAR minutes, past 3-month aerobic exercise, or VO2max by lactate, temperature, systolic blood pressure, norepinephrine or heart rate response to a bout of moderate intensity exercise.\n\nSubjective experience of exercise\n\nNext, the extent to which the subjective experience of moderate intensity exercise moderated intervention outcomes was tested. The same strategy of computing within-subjects regression slopes for each of our measures of subjective experience was utilized. There was no significant moderation of intervention effects on past 7-day PAR minutes, past 3-month aerobic exercise, or VO2max by perceived pain or affective response to a bout of moderate intensity exercise."

    "content": "3. Results\n\n3.1. Literature Search\n\nThe search strategy and the number of hints per each search are shown in Supplementary Appendix pp 1-2. A total of 3,519 published records were identified through searches (Figure 1). A total of 718 studies were excluded based on duplication, and titles/abstracts of 2913 records were screened. Of these, 341 were included for full-text review, and 4 additional studies were obtained from screening the references of included studies. A total of 44 studies consisting of 8 GWAS/linkage studies, 4 pedigree/familial studies, 19 candidate gene association studies, and 13 population/hospital-based cross-sectional studies were included. Figure S1 shows the linear growth over time of heritability, family history, and genetic studies on T2DM published in SSA. Up to 45.8% of genetic studies were published between 2011 and 2015, and 66.7% of FH and heritability were published between 2011 and 2019.\n\n3.2. Pedigree and Family Studies on T2DM in SSA\n\nAlthough few published studies have thoroughly investigated the heritability of T2DM within the SSA context, these studies demonstrate a distinct familial aggregation of T2DM and offered useful insights into the pattern of heritability of T2DM.\n\nThe reports of Meiloud et al. among 609 known T2DM Mauritanian patients indicated that 27% of T2DM patients have at least one relative with the condition. The association between PFH and T2DM was observed to be higher among first-degree compared to second-degree relatives (p = 0.003). Moreover, more probands with an affected mother than those with affected father were observed, suggesting a preferential maternal effect which does not extend to second-degree relatives.\n\nSimilar to the above findings, a prospective case-control study among 1,111 T2DM and 687 controls from the Black South African population reported 27.3% of T2DM having a PFH compared with 8.4% in the control group (p < 0.01). Also, first-degree relatives with T2DM had a significant maternal aggregation of 64.7% compared with 27% of those who had diabetic fathers (p < 0.01). In addition to these, Erasmus et al. reported that patients with PFH had an earlier onset (<50 years) of diabetes than those with NFH (p < 0.01).\n\nTwo of the studies included in this review reported severe pancreatic beta-cell secretory dysfunction among Ghanaian and Cameroonian offspring of T2DM patients compared with those of nondiabetic parents. Amoah et al. compared β-cell secretion, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity (Si), and glucose effectiveness (Sg) among 42 healthy nondiabetic first-degree relatives and 22 healthy control subjects without a PFH The mean total and acute first and second phases of serum insulin and c-peptide responses after oral glucose tolerance test at t = 60, 90, and 120 minutes (p < 0.05) were prolonged in relatives than in healthy controls. The level of insulin resistance and glucose effectiveness at basal insulin level (Sg) did not significantly differ in the relatives and healthy controls.\n\nEven though only few studies (<5) have investigated the familial aggregation of T2DM in SSA, three common themes were identified to be associated with T2DM heritability. Firstly, preference for maternal aggregation was higher among first degree compared to second-degree relatives; secondly, probands manifested a degree of β-cell impairment marked by reduced early-phase insulin secretion; and lastly, T2DM onset was early (<50 years) among relatives of diabetic individuals.\n\n3.3. Genome-Wide Association/Linkage Studies\n\nThe two maiden genome-wide linkage study in SSA among the Akan and Ga, from Ghana, Yoruba, and Igbo from Nigeria identified significant linkage signal regions on 10q23 and 4p15, while few other regions had logarithm odd (LOD) scores considered as suggestive evidence of linkage.\n\nUsing an affected sibling pair (ASP) approach with 390 short tandem repeat markers typed in 343 families in the African American Diabetes Mellitus (AADM) study, a multipoint linkage analysis identified suggestive evidence of linkage in four regions on three chromosomes; 12 (LOD = 1.92), 19 (LOD = 1.81), and 20 (LOD = 2.63), with the strongest evidence on 20q13.3 (LOD = 1.80). This region was previously identified as a T2DM susceptible locus in a non-African population. In addition, 12q24 linkage signal was identified, as has been previously reported as T2DM susceptible locus.\n\nChen et al. employed the multipoint linkage approach performed on log C-peptide using the AADM samples. Significant linkage signals were observed on 10q23 (LOD = 4.04), 4p15 (LOD = 3.48), 15q14 (LOD = 2.41), and 18p11 (LOD = 2.18). These regions were identified to harbour five positional candidate genes for T2DM and related complications: the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) in 18p11; the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 (PPARGC1) in 4p15; PTEN, PPP1R5, and IDE in 10q23 (Supplementary Appendix, pp.16).\n\nAdeyemo et al. conducted a study on the evaluation of T2DM susceptibility genome-wide loci in SSA. The study sampled 1775 subjects of which 90% were participants enrolled in the AADM study and 10% of East Africans enrolled from Kenya. The study observed 41 loci showing transferability to African sample: 11 at the exact reported SNP and 30 others at SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the reported SNP. The TCF7L2 SNP rs7903146 showed the strongest association with T2DM (p = 1.61 × 10−8, OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.26–2.15). When the 41 loci that showed transferability were fine-mapped, stronger evidence of association with T2DM was shown by neighbouring SNPs (SLC30A8 and CDKAL1) compared with index SNPs with an exception to the block that contained both TCF7L2 and ZBED3.\n\nIn a recent discovery study by Adeyemo et al. using the population group of West and East Africans, ZRANB3 (lead SNP p = 2.831 × 10−9), which has not been previously associated with T2DM, was identified as an African-specific T2DM locus. The role of ZRANB3 in an experimental model was found to be involved in β-cell functional response to high glucose conditions, thus the capacity of the pancreas to respond to insulinogenic stimuli.\n\nA study by Chen et al. found an association with T2DM using the shared variant (rs7903146) from West, East, and South Africa, the Europeans, and Africans and a distinct African-specific signal, VT11A- rs17746147. Likewise, one novel signal, rs73284431, near alkylglycerol monooxygenase (AGMO: p = 5.2 × 10−9, MAF = 0.095), distinct from previously reported signals in the African region was also detected. This indicates that combining different populations from SSA could possibly lead to the discovery of new and population-specific loci for T2DM.\n\n3.4. Association between PFH and the Risk of T2DM among SSA Population\n\nThirteen studies were identified that provided evidence on the risk of T2DM among the general population. Ten of the studies were population/community-based cross-sectional studies, two were hospital-based case-control studies, and one study was a comparative cross-sectional study. A total of 14,432 participants from the ten cross-sectional studies and the two hospital-based case-control studies were used for meta-analysis. The characteristics of the 12 studies are shown in Table S4 (Supplementary Appendix pp. 10). From the pooled studies, the prevalence of T2DM ranged from 5.4-66.8% among participants with a positive family history (PFH) and 2.5-32.2% among participants with no family history (NFH). The overall prevalence of T2DM among the SSA population with PFH of T2DM was 28.2% compared with 11.2% among participants with NFH (Table 1).\n\nA meta-analysis from the twelve studies demonstrated a significant effect of PFH on T2DM prevalence in SSA [OR = 3.29 (95% CI: 2.40-4.52)] (Figure 2). This effect size was robust in the sensitivity analysis and remained at a significant level following the omission of each single study. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis also revealed that the pooled estimate was much less impacted by odds ratios values from Bello-Ovosi et al., Millogo et al., and Mayega et al. (Figure 3). The funnel plot revealed publication bias, depicted by the asymmetrical display of odds ratios reported by the various studies (Figure 4).\n\n3.5. Candidate Gene Studies\n\nA total of 28 polymorphisms (including SNP, indels, and repeats) in 17 genes were investigated across studies. Supplementary Document: pp. 6-10 shows the distribution of the polymorphisms in various genes, including four in CAPN10 (rs3792267, rs2975762, rs5030952, rs3842570), three in TCF7L2 (rs7903146; rs12255372; DG10S478), and FTO (rs9941349, rs3751812, rs8050136); and two in ACDC (C-11377G, G-11391A) and ENPP1 (rs997509, rs1044498).\n\nA shown in Supplementary Table S3, 8 SNPs in the SCL40A1, PPAR-γ, IRS-1, AGRP, PPAR-α, and CAPN10 genes were examined and were not significantly associated with T2DM or measures of glycaemia across included studies. In single studies, the ABCC8 and Haptoglobin SNPs were found to be associated with T2DM among Nigerians and Ghanaians, respectively. Two polymorphisms in two genes (PSMD6 and C2D4B) were found to be nonsignificantly associated with T2DM in Black South Africans after correcting for multiple testing. Polymorphisms in KCNJ11 (rs5219) was found to be nonsignificantly associated with T2DM among Ghanaian and Nigerian populations but significant among Mauritanians.\n\nOf the three polymorphisms in the FTO gene reported in two studies in two black South African mixed ancestry population, only rs9941349 (OR = 1.43 (1.00-2.04), p = 0.052) was near significance, associated with T2DM after adjustment for cofounders.\n\nWith the two SNPs in ACDC reported among Black South Africans, SNP G-11391-A was found to be protective to T2DM. Of the two SNPs in ENPP1 reported among South-African Mixed ancestry, only rs997509 was found to be significantly associated with T2DM. Also, one SNP in TNF-α (−308 G/A) was reported to be associated with T2DM among the Ethiopian population.\n\nMoreover, all the variants of TCF7L2 reported among Ghanaians, Cameroonians, and Nigerians were found to be significantly associated with T2DM. Among South Africa-Mixed Ancestry, TCF7L2-rs7903146 showed marginal significance whereas TCF7L2-rs12255372 was not significantly associated with T2DM.\n\n3.6. Association between TCF7L2-rs7903146 Risk Variant and T2DM among SSA Population\n\nThe pooled estimate of the effect of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism on T2DM is shown in Figure 5. Across the three studies that assessed the effect of TCF7L2-rs7903146 using the codominant genetic model, the pooled odds ratio was 6.17 (95% CI: 2.03-18.81; I2 = 64.71%, p − heterogeneity = 0.059). The effect of TCF7L2-rs7903146 was 1.75 (95% CI: 1.18-2.59; I2 = 0.00%, p − heterogeneity = 0.859) using the recessive model across two studies; and 2.27 (95% CI: 1.50-3.44; I2 = 0.00%, p − heterogeneity = 0.789) additive model across two studies. These values suggest that the effect of TCF7L2-rs7903146 on T2DM risk is moderately strong among the SSA population with moderate heterogeneity existing across studies."
