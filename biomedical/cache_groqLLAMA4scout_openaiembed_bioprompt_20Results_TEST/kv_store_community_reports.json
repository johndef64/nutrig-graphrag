It has been used to identify genetic variants associated with anthropometric traits, including body fat and skeletal robustness. For instance, GWAS has identified the FTO gene as a risk factor for obesity.\n\n## Linkage disequilibrium and its role in genetic associations\n\nLinkage disequilibrium (LD) is a phenomenon where alleles at different loci are not randomly associated. It is used to test the association between SNPs and has been linked to genetic variants associated with anthropometric traits. For example, FTO SNPs have high linkage disequilibrium values.\n\n## SNPs and their association with anthropometric traits\n\nSNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are genomic variants associated with various diseases and traits. They are used in GWAS to identify genetic associations with specific traits, including anthropometric traits like body mass index and skeletal robustness.\n\n## FTO gene and its association with obesity\n\nThe FTO gene has been identified through GWAS as a risk factor for obesity.
