34445694,"Photo-sensibilization can be used as a tool to treat various pathological conditions. A relatively new technique called photo-theranostics can cause selective apoptotic cell death in cells and tissues that are exposed to pathological alterations. Selective accumulation of photo-sensitizing substance in cellular components allows to target them selectively at sub-cellular level. Molecules that can be used for photo-theranostics in case of mitochondria have already been discovered. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is a well-known photosensitizer. This agent is generated in the mitochondria from a precursor, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). Application of exogenous 5-ALA leads to PpIX enrichment which depends on the cellular metabolic profile and is already used for treatment of some cancers. However, this approach is currently at the early development stage, and its clinical relevance is still unclear.",,,
34065857,"All the factors described above, such as gender, penetration, pleiotropy, tissue type, type of mutation, may be responsible for the way the mtDNA mutation is revealed. It may also explain why the increased risk of cancer has not been reported in a group of patients with mitochondrial disease yet. The understanding of these mitochondrial DNA dysfunctions is still incomplete.",,,
28906532,"Although of small size, one such study helps to highlight the challenges posed by these gaps in our current data. Ameh et al. could not find the tRNA mutation m.3243A>G in Nigerian type 2 diabetes patients, despite an association being previously reported in other European and Asian populations. This and other studies illustrate the difficulty of extrapolating genetic risk factors for disease from one population group to the next, and the need for population-specific studies.",,,
32575796,"Outside from the SCFA major classes of microbiota-secreted metabolites, other metabolites produced by the gut bacteria from dietary products can influence the host cell metabolism. Such is the case for isovanillic acid 3-O-sulfate (IVAS), a metabolite produced by the microbiota upon consumption of the cyanidin 3-O-glucoside found in berries and that is detected in the blood. Houghton and coworkers showed that this compound increased the uptake of glucose and the metabolism of the differentiated human skeletal muscle myoblast line LHCN-M2 through an increased concentration and activity of the glucose transporter GLUT4, along with an activated PI3K/AKT signaling.","Depending on the properties of the metabolites produced by specific microbiota, which can be either beneficial or harmful for humans, the corresponding microbiota can be therapeutically supplemented to the patients, or instead specifically removed with adapted antibodies. Current clinical trials actually include the supplementation of the microbiota of cancer patients undergoing strong antibiotic treatments prior to bone marrow transplantation. Microbiota supplementation can be performed either by heterologous or homologous fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). The latter possibility can be used, for instance, with the microbiota of patients that can be stored during the patient microbiota-damaging treatment, such as radio- or chemo-therapy, in order to prevent further microbiota-related therapeutic side effects.",,

33865346,"Consequently, the present study aimed to explore the interrelationship between various mitochondrial genetic abnormalities (mtDNA variations and mtDNAcn change), baseline intracellular ROS levels and sensitivity to ROS-stimulating drugs such as CDDP and DQA within the same panel of cell lines employed in our previous study. Here we show that mtDNAcn and the total number of non-synonymous variations within the mitochondrial genome have a strong correlation with both baseline ROS level and drug resistance. 3D structural modelling of these reveals a subset of variations that could be responsible for the observed mtDNA genotype-mitochondrial/cellular phenotype links. While repeating these experiments with the different mtDNAs on a standardised nuclear genetic background is warranted, we propose that this is a useful first step in the characterisation of the cancer cell lines, and reveals a subset of variations that have the potential to be used to stratify patient into subgroups that are most likely to benefit from ROS-stimulating agents in the future.",Not applicable.,"Among the subset of 8 variations classified as functional, only three: A10398G, G13708A and T14798C occur frequently in healthy tissues, i.e. more than 500 in 30,000 (1.6%) of complete mitochondrial genomes in at least 2 out 3 of the consulted databases (Table S3). On the other hand, 5 of the functional variations: A13966G, T11120C, C12084T, A13681G and C13802T as well as the D-loop variation 310InsC occur rarely in healthy tissues, i.e. less than 1.6% of the complete mitochondrial genomes in at least 2 out of 3 of the databases consulted (Table S3). A MitoMAP search of the subset of the 8 functional variations and 310IncC revealed that 5 have not been previously reported as either somatic or inherited variations, i.e. they are of unknown heritability (T11120C, C12084T, A13681G, C13802T, and 310InsC); three have been reported as somatic or inherited (A10398G, G13708A and T14798C), and one has been reported as inherited (A13966G) (Table S3). While our results indicate that variations occurring at low frequencies in healthy tissues are more likely to be previously unreported variations of potential functional importance, the possibility that previously reported somatic or inherited variations occurring at high frequencies in healthy tissues could also play a role in increased baseline ROS level, drug resistance and mtDNAcn cannot be ruled out.","It is worth mentioning that two cell lines of distinctly opposite characteristics were identified among the tested cancer cell lines in our studies that was either the most sensitive (i.e. Ishikawa) or the most resistant (i.e. Caco-2) to ROS-stimulating therapy. The profiles of Ishikawa and Caco-2 based on the ROS/mtDNAcn/functional complexes I/III mutation parameters could be further validated as benchmarks to assess cancer cells’ response towards ROS-stimulating therapy. In addition, these two cell lines would make for interesting candidates for future downstream cybrid/mtDNA gene editing studies to help validate that the differences observed in the present study are due to mtDNA pattern and not due to differences in their nuclear proteomes."
27161322,"As part of a genetic screening program for hypertension in a cohort of 2,070 Han Chinese hypertensive subjects, we identified the T-to-C transition at position 5655 (5655A → G) at the 5′ end of the tRNAAla gene in three genetically unrelated probands whose families exhibited a maternal transmission of hypertension (see the supplemental material). As shown in Fig. 1, the m.5655A → G mutation was located at the processing site for the tRNA 5′ end precursors, catalyzed by RNase P. Furthermore, the m.5655A → G mutation changes the highly conserved base pairing (A1-U72) at the aminoacyl acceptor stem to G1-U72. It was hypothesized that the destabilization of base pairing (1A-72U) and change of the processing site for the tRNA 5′ end precursor by the m.5655A → G mutation altered the structure and function of tRNAAla. In particular, the mutation may affect the aminoacylation capacity and stability of this tRNA. A failure in tRNA metabolism leads to the impairment of mitochondrial translation and respiration. It was also proposed that mitochondrial dysfunctions caused by the tRNA mutation alter the production of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS). To investigate the pathogenic mechanism of the m.5655A → G mutation in these Chinese families, cybrid cell lines were constructed by transferring mitochondria from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from an affected matrilineal relative carrying the m.5655A → G mutation and from a control individual lacking the mtDNA mutation into human mtDNA-less [rho0] cells. These cybrid cell lines were first examined for the presence and degree of the mtDNA mutation. These cell lines were then assessed for the effects of the mtDNA mutation on tRNA metabolism, including aminoacylation efficiency and steady-state levels, mitochondrial translation, respiration, and production of ATP and ROS.","Statistical analysis was carried out using the unpaired, two-tailed Student t test of the Microsoft Excel program or Excel for Macintosh (version 2007). Differences were considered significant at a P value of <0.05.","The total cellular levels of ROS generation in the vital cells derived from three mutant cell lines carrying the m.5655A → G mutation and three control cell lines lacking the mutation were measured with flow cytometry under normal conditions and under H2O2 stimulation. Geometric mean intensity was recorded to measure the rate of ROS of each sample. The ratio of geometric mean intensity between unstimulated and H2O2-stimulated cells was calculated to delineate the reaction upon increasing levels of ROS under oxidative stress. As shown in Fig. 10A, the total cellular levels of ROS generation in the mutant cell lines carrying the m.5655A → G mutation varied from 103% to 115%, with an average of 110% (P = 0.001) of the mean value measured in the control cell lines. Furthermore, the levels of mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS) among the cybrids were determined using a MitoSOX assay via flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 10B, the levels of mitochondrial ROS generation in the mutant cell lines carrying the m.5655A → G mutation ranged from 157% to 201%, with an average of 180% (P = 0.001) of the mean value measured in the control cell lines.","In summary, our findings suggest the pathogenic mechanism leading to an impaired oxidative phosphorylation in cybrid cell lines carrying the hypertension-associated tRNAAla 5655A → G mutation. The m.5655A → G mutation alters the secondary structure and function of tRNA. A failure in tRNA metabolism impaired mitochondrial translation and respiration. As a result, this respiratory deficiency reduced mitochondrial ATP production, increased the production of oxidative reactive species, and subsequently elevated blood pressure. Thus, our findings may provide new insights into the understanding of the pathophysiology of maternally inherited hypertension."
29178484,"Very little is known about the way most metalloproteins obtain their metal cofactors. Although some metallochaperones exist, in many cases the metal must be not only incorporated into the protein during de novo folding but also needs to be selected from any of the other metals in the immediate environmental vicinity; the process of metalation.1 Mononuclear superoxide dismutases utilise either iron or manganese in their active sites and metalation of these enzymes can be made dependent upon the availability of the metal through provision of the metal in the culture growth medium when they are overexpressed in E.coli.2 The manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and iron superoxide dismutase (FeSOD) of E.coli are extremely similar in sequence (45 % conservative amino acids) and structure (91 % homology and RMSDCα‐monomer 1.6 Å) and yet to become an active enzyme, each enzyme must bind its cognate metal.3 Each enzyme may fold correctly while incorporating the “wrong” metal but the enzyme does not catalyse the conversion of superoxide to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, the normal function of SOD.4 Several attempts have been made using site‐directed mutagenesis to change ion specificity with the aim to interconvert SOD ion dependence, but with very little success.3c, 5 Interestingly, there are SODs that do indeed function with either metal and site‐directed mutagenesis has succeeded in adjusting the metal specificity of these, but they remain cambialistic nonetheless.6 One focus of such experiments has been the highly conserved glutamine residue in the active site that forms an intrinsic part of the hydrogen‐bonded network of amino acids and water necessary for full enzyme activity. The main reason for this is that in FeSOD the glutamine is provided by the N‐domain of the protein while in MnSOD the glutamine is contributed by the C‐domain. In either case the Nϵ2 and Oϵ1 atoms occupy almost identical positions in three‐dimensional space.5b, 7 This arrangement does not affect the three histidine residues and the aspartate that also coordinate directly to the metal cofactor, nor does it interfere with the one water (or hydroxyl ion, designated WAT1) directly bound to the metal; a common feature of all SODs. Furthermore, the glutamine, while bonding with the metal‐attached water, continues a hydrogen‐bonding network by binding to a similarly conserved tyrosine at position 34 in the sequence. Various analyses have been performed to identify the amino acid sequences that might form a signature for the discrimination between iron and manganese SODs with some initial success. Today, over three hundred SOD amino acids sequences are known and the boundary has become blurred and more difficult to identify. However, the signature first described by Parker and Blake (1988) to determine an MnSOD is reasonably accurate.8 One notable exception is the arrangement of amino acids found in the FeSOD of M.tuberculosis, in which the normally conserved N‐domain glutamine is replaced by a histidine residue provided by the C‐domain.9 We have therefore tested this intriguing exception by replacing glutamine in a C.elegans MnSOD (MnSOD‐3) with a histidine, generating the site‐directed mutant MnSOD‐3[Q142H]. We show that this single amino acid substitution is sufficient to convert the MnSOD into a cambialistic SOD, which we propose to be an essential element that determines ion specificity while maintaining SOD function.",The secondary structures of the proteins were assessed by CD measurements using a PiStar spectrometer (Applied Photosystems). Far‐UV (180–260 nm) CD spectra of the proteins (0.3 mg mL−1) in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm pH 7.8) were recorded in stepwise increments of 0.5 nm at 25 °C in a cuvette of 0.1 cm pathlength with a 2 nm bandwidth. The unfolding transition temperature was followed by CD with a temperature ramp between 20 °C and 90 °C (1 °C per minute) at 222 nm and a 4 nm bandwidth. Temperature was monitored using a probe in the stoppered cuvette.,"The electrostatic potential was calculated by solving linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation for solvent ionic strength I=0.15 M. Atomic charges of the metal cofactor were derived with the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) procedure from the electrostatic potential calculated at the B3LYP/def2‐SVP level. The active site surface is mainly positive in character, which is due to the positive formal (+1) charge of the metal cofactor. The surplus charge is not limited to the metal ion as it smears into the ligands coordinated to the metal. Figure 3 shows the results of these calculations for the cambialistic mutant MnSOD‐3[Q142H]. We have observed and analysed similar electrostatics for the wild‐type and iron‐containing MnSOD‐3 and for the manganese‐ and iron‐substituted mutant. We have looked at the overall electrostatic potentials generated at the protein surface as well as within the active site (Figure 3 and Supporting Information) and have found little difference between the proteins.

26735972,"The reasons underlying the variability in clinical spectrum and phenotypic severity associated with the homozygous A467T substitution remain unclear. We studied four unrelated patients with homozygous A467T POLG mutations and assessed them longitudinally to characterise the clinical spectrum of A467T-related disease. We undertook molecular genetic studies including MitoChip resequencing analysis, to consider the role of genetic modifiers on phenotype, and performed detailed pathological analysis of muscle, brain and liver samples. We present the results of our investigations and consider the mechanisms by which homozygous A467T mutations give rise to such diverse phenotypes.","The study was approved and performed under the ethical guidelines issued by the Joint National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and University College London—Institute of Neurology Ethics Committee for clinical studies, with written informed consent obtained for all subjects for genetic studies, diagnostic tests and medical procedures. In the case of minors, informed written consent was obtained from their guardian on their behalf. All persons providing consent were clinically assessed to have capacity.","Mitochip re-sequencing analysis of the entire mtDNA molecule revealed a large number of variants in each of the four patients (identified variants are summarised in Table 2) with considerable variation between individuals. Patient 4 had an A to G point mutation at np 13528 in the complex 1 MTND5 gene which has been previously reported to be pathogenic in this patient. In addition, Patient 4 harboured an A>G change at np 12307, which has never previously been reported and a C>T change at np 13565. The first is in the MTTL2 gene encoding the transfer RNA for leucine (CUN), whilst the second results in a serine to phenylalanine substitution in the ND5 subunit of complex I. Patient 1 harboured a G>A transition at np 14279 which results in a serine to leucine substitution in the ND6 subunit of complex I. This has previously only been reported in 1/2704 individuals (http://www.mtdb.igp.uu.se/). Haplotype data for each patient is presented in Table 2.","In summary, our data provides evidence that the phenotype caused by a homozygous nuclear gene mutation, A467T in POLG, is strongly related to the downstream mtDNA effects in an individual patient, so that mtDNA depletion results in an early-onset severe phenotype, whereas deletions are associated with later onset disease, and in one case fixation of a heteroplasmic mtDNA point mutation (arguably the result of defective Pol γ proofreading activity) may have contributed to a MELAS-like phenotype."
27536005,"As the part of a genetic screening program for deafness in a cohort of 2651 Han Chinese affected subjects, we identified the novel m.7551A > G mutation in the mt–tRNAAsp gene in one Han Chinese pedigrees with maternal transmission of nonsyndromic deafness. As shown in Figure 1, the m.7551A > G mutation is localized at a highly conserved nucleotide (A37), adjacent (3′) to the anticodon of mt–tRNAAsp. There were no modifications of i6A37 or t6A37 in the human mitochondrial tRNAAsp, although the nucleotides at position 37 (A or G) of tRNAs are often modified by methylthiolation. The modifications at position 37 were shown to contribute to the high fidelity of codon recognition and to the structural formation and stabilization of functional tRNAs. Thus, the substitution of A with G at position 37 of the mt–tRNAAsp may introduce the m1G37 modification of this tRNA, thereby altering the structure and function of mt–tRNAAsp. In particular, the mutation may affect the aminoacylation capacity and stability of this mt–tRNA and then impair mitochondrial translation. It was also proposed that an impairment of mitochondrial translation caused by the mt–tRNA mutation alters the respiration, production of adenosine triphoshate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). To further investigate the pathogenic mechanism of the m.7551A > G mutation, cybrid cell lines were constructed by transferring mitochondria from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from an affected matrilineal relative in a Chinese family carrying the mtDNA mutation and from a control individual lacking the mtDNA mutation, into human mtDNA-less (ρ°) cells. First, we examined if the m.7551A > G mutation created the m1G37 modification of mt–tRNAAsp by using primer extension. These resultant cybrid cell lines were then assessed for the effects of the mtDNA mutation on the aminoacylation capacity and stability of this mt–tRNA, mitochondrial translation, respiration and the production of ATP and ROS as well as mitochondrial membrane potential.","Statistical analysis was carried out using the unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test contained in the Microsoft-Excel program or Macintosh (version 2007). Differences were considered significant at a P < 0.05.","The levels of the ROS generation in the vital cells derived from three mutant cybrid cell lines carrying the m.7551A > G mutation and three control cybrid cell lines lacking the mutation were measured with flow cytometry under normal conditions and following H2O2 stimulation. Geometric mean intensity was recorded to measure the rate of ROS of each sample. The ratio of geometric mean intensity between unstimulated and stimulated with H2O2 in each cell line was calculated to delineate the reaction upon increasing level of ROS under oxidative stress. As shown in Figure 9, the levels of ROS generation in the mutant cell lines carrying the m.7551A > G mutation ranged from 126 and 140%, with an average 132% (P = 0.0035) of the mean value measured in the control cell lines.","In summary, our findings convincingly demonstrate the pathogenic mechanism leading to an impaired oxidative phosphorylation in cybrid cell lines carrying the deafness-associated m.7551A > G mutation in the mt–tRNAAsp gene. The m.7551A > G mutation created the m1G37 modification of mt-tRNAAsp, but reduced the efficiency of aminoacylation and stability of this tRNA. A failure in tRNAAsp metabolism led to the decreased synthesis of mtDNA encoding polypeptides and respiration. As a result, this respiratory deficiency reduced mitochondrial ATP production and increased the production of oxidative reactive species. The subsequent hearing loss may be involved in the participation of other genetic, epigenetic and environmental modifier factors. Thus, our findings may provide the new insights into the understanding of pathophysiology of maternally inherited deafness that was manifested by altered nucleotide modification of mitochondrial tRNA."
