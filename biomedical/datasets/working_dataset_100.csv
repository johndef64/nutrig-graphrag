34836030,"1. Introduction<SEP>Asians with a high body mass index (BMI) have a higher body fat mass than Caucasians. Asians with higher adiposity have a greater risk of metabolic diseases than Caucasians with the same adiposity level. Accordingly, the World Health Organization defines obesity among Asians as a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or more for both genders and as a body fat of 25% and 30% for men and women, respectively.<SEP>Obesity is a multifactorial disorder including genetic, gut microbial, and environmental factors that influence energy balance. Although monogenic variants are involved in severe obesity, they are rare, and approximately 500 genetic variants of approximately 400 genes have been revealed to be associated with obesity risk at p < 5 × 10−8. Most studies have explored the effect of an individual genetic variant on obesity risk. A polygenic model provides the cumulative genetic impact on obesity risk compared to individual genetic variants when the selected genes have gene−gene and SNP−SNP interactions with the pathways of biological relevance to obesity. Polygenetic risk scores (PRS) calculated by a sum of the number of risk alleles of each SNP is informative for examining the polygenetic impact on obesity risk. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genetic variants have been reported to be strongly associated with obesity risk in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis studies of children and adults of different ethnicities including Europeans, Americans, Asians, and Africans. <SEP>In the protein−protein interaction network analysis, MC4R, one of the hub genes related to obesity, is highly interconnected with gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR), luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR), calcitonin receptor (CALCR), adenylate cyclase (ADCY)3, ADCY9, FTO, transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18), BDNF, and potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 15 (KCTD15). These genes are related to the obesity-related signaling pathways such as the AMP kinase (AMPK), neurotrophin, and phosphoinositide 3-kinases àAkt signaling pathway. Their variants affect the obesity risk by modulating the binding affinity of obesity-related transcription factors, such as STAT3, CEBPB, TCF7L2, FTO, and GATA2, and changing the phosphorylation of proteins, such as BDNF with the rs6265 risk allele. The interaction of the genetic variants may account for a more significant proportion of the genetic impact on obesity. However, the genetic variant−genetic variant interaction of the obesity-related genes has not been highly studied.<SEP>Furthermore, obesity-related genetic variants do not always equally influence obesity risk in different people because there are complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, behavior, and the gut microbiota, influencing the actual obesity phenotypes. Recent studies have demonstrated that an individual genetic variant and lifestyle interactions influence the risk of obesity and metabolic diseases in Europeans and Asians. For example, FTO genetic variants interact with the genetic and environmental factors that influence obesity risk. Adult Asians with the FTO_rs1421085 risk allele have a higher BMI than those with the nonrisk allele when they have no regular exercise. On the other hand, adults with the risk allele have a lower BMI when they engage in regular exercise. These observations suggest that the interaction of regular exercise with FTO_rs1421085 modulates obesity risk, indicating that genetic variants interact with lifestyles. However, there is no study to determine the interaction between the PRS of the genetic variant−genetic variant interaction and lifestyles. This study hypothesized that the PRS of the interacting genetic variants associated with obesity risk interacts with lifestyle factors in middle-aged and elderly adults. We aimed to examine the hypothesis in a large city hospital-based cohort in Korea.","2. Methods<SEP>2.1. Participants<SEP>During 2004–2013, 58,630 Korean adults aged >40 years volunteered to participate in a hospital-based city cohort study called the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) organized by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The replicate study, used only to validate obesity-related genetic variants, was conducted in 5493 adults, aged 40–79 years, for whom Korean Chip data was available among the Ansan/Ansung cohort. People with a history of cancers, thyroid diseases, chronic kidney disease, and brain-related diseases were excluded from the participants. The urban hospital-based cohort and Ansan/Ansung cohort excluded 4802 and 691 patients, respectively. All procedures of the KoGES conformed with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Korean National Institute of Health (KBP-2019-055) and Hoseo University (1041231-150811-HR-034-01). All participants provided written informed consent.<SEP>2.2. Demographic, Anthropometric, and Biochemical Information<SEP>Participants were interviewed to obtain their demographic information (e.g., age, residence area, education, income, current occupation, smoking status, alcohol intake, and regular exercise). The residence area was where the participant had lived for over 6 months when he/she enrolled in the city-based cohort study. It was categorized into six provinces, including Gyeonggi-do plus Seoul, Chungcheong-do, Gangwon-do, Jeolla-do, Gyeongsang-do plus Busan, and Jeju-Do. Household income was stratified as very low (<USD 1000/month), low (USD 1000–2000/month), intermediate (USD 2000–4000/month), or high (>USD 4000/month). Educational status was classified as less than high school, high school, or college or higher. Current job status was defined as the occupation where the person had been employed for the longest period if the job was recently changed. Current job status was classified as unemployed when a participant reported being unemployed or a housewife and employed as professional, director, office worker, service staff, salesperson, agricultural or fishery worker, labor worker. Alcohol intake was quantified from the questionnaires about alcohol drinking frequencies and amounts according to alcohol beverage types. The participants were classified as light (<100 g/week) or heavy (≥100 g/week) drinkers based on their average daily alcohol intake (Table 1). The smoking status was categorized as current, past, or never, and defined as current when >100 cigarettes had been smoked over the previous six months.<SEP>Anthropometric measurements, including body weight, height, and waist circumferences, were assessed according to standardized procedures. After an overnight fast (no food for over 12 h), a participant visited the hospital, and they switched clothes into a light gown with no shoes. Body weight, and height were measured in a standing position using a well-calibrated digital weight and height scale (Inbody, Cheonan, Korea). Waist circumference was measured taken around the abdomen at the position of two finger-widths above the umbilicus in a relaxed state with a tape measure (Stanley, New Britain, CT, USA). The BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kilograms) by height2 (meters). Blood pressure was measured using a sphygmomanometer (W.A. Baum Co., New York, NY, USA), on the right arm, in a sitting position, at heart level. The biochemical parameters were determined using plasma and serum from blood drawn after an overnight fast. Skeletal muscle mass was predicted using a machine learning approach from the Ansan/Ansung cohort data measured with an Inbody scanner (Cheonan, Korea). The skeletal muscle index was defined as skeletal muscle mass divided by the BMI. The lipid profiles and the glucose and creatinine in plasma and serum concentrations were measured using a Hitachi 7600 Automatic Analyzer (Hitachi LTD., Tokyo, Japan). WBC counts were obtained from heparin-treated blood. The blood hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; glycated hemoglobin) concentrations were determined using a Hitachi 7600 Automatic Analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), and the plasma lipid profiles (total cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride) were examined using a Hitachi 7600 Automatic Analyzer. The serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations were measured using an ELISA kit. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the equation of 175 × (serum creatinine concentrations)−1.154 × (age)−0.203. In females, the eGFR was multiplied by 0.742.<SEP>2.3. Definition of Obesity and MetS<SEP>Obesity for Asians is defined as ≥25 kg/m2. In the urban hospital-based and Ansan/Ansung cohorts, 17,545 and 2756 participants belonged to high-BMI (case), respectively, and 36,283 and 5395 participants in low-BMI (control), respectively.<SEP>MetS was defined according to the 2005 revised National Cholesterol Education Program−Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for Asia. Participants with three or more of the following criteria were considered as having MetS: (1) elevated blood pressure (average systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mmHg) or current blood pressure medication use; (2) low HDL-C concentration (<40 mg/dL for men and <50 mg/dL for women); (3) elevated serum triglyceride concentration (≥150 mmol/L) or current anti-dyslipidemic medication use; (4) elevated fasting blood glucose concentration (≥100 mmol/L) or current use of antidiabetic medication; (5) abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥ 90 cm for men and ≥85 cm for women).<SEP>2.4. Food and Nutrient Intake and Dietary Patterns<SEP>The food and nutrient intakes were assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ) developed and validated during the KoGES. The usual dietary intake was estimated over the previous six months. The questionnaire requested information regarding the intake of 106 food items. Each participant completed the SQFFQ, and 23 nutrient intakes were calculated from the SQFFQ data using the Computer-Aided Nutritional Analysis Program (CAN Pro) 3.0, a nutrient database program developed by the Korean Nutrition Society.<SEP>The 106 food items included were categorized into 29 food groups. These 29 food groups were used as independent variables during factor analysis to determine the dietary patterns using the FACTOR procedure. The number of factors retained in principle component analysis was determined using the eigenvalues >1.5, and the orthogonal rotation procedure (Varimax) was applied. Dietary factor-loading values of ≥0.40 indicated significant contributions to the dietary patterns. Four distinct dietary factors were selected for the Korean dietary patterns. As integrating food intake estimated by SQFFQ, the participants were categorized into a balanced Korean diet, plant-based diet, Western-style diet, and rice-based diet. The plant-based diet was high in beans, eggs, milk, beverage, fruits, and nuts, while the Western-style diet was rich in noodles, soups, meats, processed meats, and fast foods.<SEP>2.5. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)<SEP>DII represents an index of dietary inflammatory potentials from individual food and nutrient intake using their dietary inflammatory weights for certain foods and nutrients (energy, 32 nutrients, four food products, four spices, and caffeine), as previously described. Since the SQFFQ did not include the intake of spices, we excluded intake of garlic, ginger, saffron, and turmeric from DII calculations. DII was calculated by multiplying the dietary inflammatory scores of the 38 food and nutrient components by daily intake and dividing the sum of the scores of 38 items by 100.<SEP>2.6. Genotyping Using a Korean Chip and Quality Control<SEP>The genotype data were provided by the Center for Genome Science at the Korea National Institute of Health. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood, and genotypes were determined using a Korean Chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which was designed to examine the Korean genetic variants and included the disease-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The genotyping accuracy was checked by Bayesian Robust Linear Modeling using the Mahalanobis Distance Genotyping Algorithm. For genotyping analysis using this Korean chip, the genotyping accuracy, missing genotype call rate, and heterozygosity were ≥98%, <4%, and <30%, respectively; the data showed no gender bias. In addition, genetic variants that met the Hardy−Weinberg equilibrium (HWE, p > 0.05) and minor allele frequency (MAF) > 1% criterion were included.<SEP>2.7. Genetic Variants Influencing the Obesity Risk and the Best Model with SNP−SNP Interactions<SEP>The steps to select genetic variants for the best model of SNP−SNP interactions are shown in Figure 1. Genetic variants for obesity risk were explored by conducting GWAS with low-BMI (n = 36,283) and high-BMI groups (n = 17,545) in the urban hospital-based cohort (p < 0.00001). From the GWAS, 9335 genetic variants were selected at p < 5 × 10−5. Gene names of the 9335 SNPs were identified using g:Profiler (, accessed on 29 March 2021), and 367 genes (3858 SNPs) were identified. The 3415 SNPs without identified gene names were discarded since their association with obesity cannot be explained by associations with obesity-related pathways. Among the 367 genes, the 36 obesity-related genes (453 SNPs) based on the literature were selected using HuGE Navigator (, accessed on 8 April 2021). The corresponding linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses were performed on the SNPs of the selected genes in the same chromosomes using Haploview 4.2 in PLINK. Because SNPs with high r2 values provided the same information on the genetic impact, they were not included in the GMDR. The potential genetic variants in the same chromosome were not strongly correlated in an LD analysis (r2 < 0.3).<SEP>Of the 45 potential genetic variants in the 36 obesity-related genes, ten SNPs exhibiting SNP−SNP interactions strongly associated with an obesity risk were automatically selected by generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) with 1–10 marker count range, 10 CVC, and exhaustive search type. GMDR provided ten potential models among different combinations of 45 genetic variants. The best SNP−SNP interaction model was selected in a sign rank test of trained balanced accuracy (TRBA) and testing balanced accuracy (TEBA) with or without adjusting for the covariates using a GMDR program and a p-value threshold of 0.05. The covariates used were age, gender, residence area, education, income, occupation, energy intake, alcohol intake, regular exercise, and smoking status. Ten-fold cross-validation was also checked for cross-validation consistency (CVC) because the sample size was larger than 1000, and 10 out of 10 in CVC met the perfect cross-validation criteria. Using the best model determined by GMDR analysis, the risk allele of each SNP in the selected best model was counted as 1. For example, when people had AA, AG, and GG of one SNP, and the A allele was the risk allele, the genetic score for the SNP was 2, 1, and 0, respectively. The PRS for the best gene−gene-interaction model was assessed by summating the number of the risk alleles (genetic score) from each selected SNP in the best gene−gene-interaction model. The PRS in the five and seven SNP models was divided into three categories according to the number of risk alleles; they were classified as low PRS, middle PRS, and high PRS when the number of risk alleles in the PRS was 0–3, 4–5, and ≥6 in the 5-SNP model and 0–5, 6–7, and ≥8 in the 7-SNP model, respectively.<SEP>2.8. Statistical Analyses<SEP>Statistical analysis was conducted using PLINK version 2.0 (, accessed on 9 March 2021) and SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Descriptive statistics of the categorical variables (e.g., gender and smoking status, etc.) were analyzed using the frequency distributions in the low-, middle-, and high-PRS groups. The significant differences between their frequency distributions were assessed using a chi-squared test. The descriptive values of continuous variables were expressed as the means and standard deviations according to the PRS categories. The significance of the differences among the PRS groups was analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to adjust covariates. Finally, multiple comparisons among the PRS groups were performed using a Tukey’s test.<SEP>The associations among the PRSs were obtained using the best model, and the obesity risk was examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis with an adjustment for covariates. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated against an index reference: low PRS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using two adjusted models. The covariates of model 1 included gender, age, residence area, education, and income, while those of model 2 contained the covariates in model 1 plus smoking status, drinking amount, daily energy intake, and regular exercise. The adjusted ORs and 95% CI were calculated for obesity risk according to PRS.<SEP>The participants were categorized into higher and lower intake groups using the classification criterion described above. A multivariate interaction model was used to examine the interactions between PRS and lifestyles and demographic parameters after adjusting for the covariates. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. ","3. Results<SEP>3.1. General and Demographic Characteristics of the Participants According to Gender and Obesity<SEP>The men were older than the women, while the obese women were older than the nonobese women (p < 0.001). Obese women were shorter than nonobese women, but there was no height difference linked to obesity in men (p < 0.001). The average BMIs of the nonobese and obese groups were approximately 22.5 and 27.1 kg/m2, respectively, in both gender groups (Table 1). The waist circumferences were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, but men in the obese and nonobese groups had greater waist circumferences than women in the corresponding weight groups. Interestingly, the skeletal muscle and fat mass were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group for both genders (p < 0.05; Table 1). On the other hand, the adjusted ORs were much higher for waist circumferences (OR = 18.3 and 95% CI: 16.5–20.3) and fat mass (OR = 20.71 and 95% CI = 17.83–24.16) for obesity risk than the skeletal muscle mass. The initial menstrual age was younger in the obese group than in the nonobese group, while there was no significant difference in menopausal age in the obese and nonobese groups (Table 1).<SEP>The incidence of metabolic syndrome was much higher in the obese groups in both genders, and the risk of metabolic syndrome increased 5.86-fold in the obese group (p < 0.001; Table 1). The components of metabolic syndrome were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders. Serum total cholesterol and LDL concentrations were much higher in women than men, but the serum triglyceride concentrations were higher in men than women (Table 1). The serum HDL concentrations were higher in women than men. In the combined lipid profiles, women had as many lipid disturbances as men. Furthermore, obese women exhibited higher serum hs-CRP concentrations than nonobese women, but this was not observed in men (Table 1). Blood pressure, including systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), was higher in the obese group than the nonobese group, and men showed higher blood pressure than women. Women had much higher eGFR than men, and eGFR was lower in the obese group than in the nonobese group. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations were higher in the obese groups than the nonobese groups in both genders. Obesity increased the odds ratio for higher AST and ALT concentrations by 2.0 and 2.7-fold, respectively (Table 1). <SEP>3.2. Lifestyle Characteristics of the Participants According to Genders and Obesity<SEP>The daily energy intake based on the estimated energy intake was higher in the obese groups than the nonobese group in both genders, and it increased the obesity risk by 1.24-fold. The protein intake also elevated the obesity risk (p < 0.05; Table 2) based on the daily energy intake. In women, the carbohydrate intake was higher in the obesity group than the nonobese group, and the association of the carbohydrate intake with the obesity risk was marginally significant (p = 0.0508). Fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and cholesterol intake, were not associated with the obesity risk (Table 2). Their intake was slightly higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in men, but their intakes showed an opposite tendency in women. DII was similar in the obese and nonobese groups, but DII was higher in men than women (Table 2). Interestingly, the fried-food intake was higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, but the intake of sugar-containing foods was higher in the nonobese groups than the obese group in women, but not men (Table 2). Obese men had a higher intake of a Korean balanced diet and Western-style diet than the nonobese men, while there was no difference in the plant-based diet and rice-based diet intake in obese and nonobese men (Table 2). Obese women had a lower plant-based diet and a higher Korean balanced diet than nonobese women. There was no significant association of dietary patterns with obesity risk (Table 2).<SEP>Alcohol intake was much higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, particularly in men (Table 2). Alcohol intake was positively associated with the obesity risk. Fewer current smokers belonged to the obese group than the nonobese group in men but not women (Table 2). Regular exercise lowered the incidence of obesity in women but not men. Regular exercise was inversely associated with the risk of obesity (Table 2). <SEP>3.3. Genetic Variants Related to the Obesity Risk and the Best Model with SNP-SNP Interaction<SEP>Ten genes with SNPs that affect the obesity risk were chosen to examine genetic variant−genetic variant interactions in the GMDR in the urban hospital-based cohort (Table 3). The selected genetic variants involved in the obesity risk were SEC16 Homolog B (SEC16B, endoplasmic reticulum export factor) rs543874, DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C27 (DNAJC27)_rs713586, CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1)_rs9356744, transcription factor AP-2 Beta (TFAP2B)_rs2206277, BDNF_rs6265, myosin light chain-2 (MYL2)_rs3782889, olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4)_rs9568856, FTO_rs1421085, MC4R_rs6567160, and GIPR_rs1444988703 (Table 3). These genes were strongly connected, and FTO and MC4R acted as hub genes that affect the risk of obesity. All of the genes were involved in either energy intake or energy expenditure by modulating transcription factors. These SNPs satisfied the MAF (>0.01) and HWE (p > 0.05) criteria (Table 2). Some SNPs had an inverse association with obesity risk, while the other SNPs were positively associated with the obesity risk. The p values of most selected SNPs were higher than 5×10−7, but rs3782889_MYL2 and rs9356744_CDKAL1 did not meet the statistical criteria (Table 3). These SNPs had similar associations with the obesity risk, and the statistical significance was higher in the Ansan/Ansung cohort (Table 3), but they were not ultimately included in the best model.<SEP>Among the genetic variants selected, the models including 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 SNPs met the criteria of TREB and CVC for the best model to explain the SNP−SNP interactions that contribute to obesity risk. The five models exhibited significant interactions among the genetic variants that influenced the obesity risk (Table 4). The 5-SNP model included SEC16B_rs543874, DNAJC27_rs713586, BDNF_rs6265, MC4R_rs6567160, and GIPR_rs1444988703. The genetic variants in model 5 plus CDKAL1_rs9356744 and OLFM4_rs9568856 (model 7) also exhibited significant interactions (Table 4). The models that added the remainder of the SNPs to model 7 also had significant interactions for obesity risk. After adjusting for covariates, the models included five, seven, eight, nine, and ten genetic variants that met the TRBA, TEBA, and CVC criteria, including gender, age, resident area, regular exercise, and smoking status. However, since all of these models have similar statistical significance; therefore model 5, which included the smallest number of variables, was selected.<SEP>Model 5 resulted in participants having PRS scores ranging from 0–9 risk alleles. The results show that BMI showed an increasing trend with PRS, and the participants with PRS scores of 8 and 9 had a sharp increment in BMI (Figure 2A). Although there was a positive association between PRS and BMI, some severely obese and underweight participants were distributed among the top deciles of PRS (8 and 9) to the bottom decile (0). However, obese (25–30 kg/m2) and severely obese (>30 kg/m2) persons had much higher representations in the middle deciles (2–7) than normal (18.5–23 kg/m2 for men and 18.5–22 kg/m2 for women), overweight (23–25 kg/m2 for men and 22–25 kg/m2 for women), and underweight (Figure 2B). In the other stratification, participants were assigned to low PRS (0–3), medium PRS (4–5), and high PRS (≥6) (Figure 2C). The PRS stratification showed a similar pattern of the top, middle, and bottom deciles, but the percentage of overweight participants in the three PRS groups was not significantly different.<SEP>The high PRS of the 5-SNP model was positively associated with the obesity risk: by 1.626 (1.474–1.801) and 1.629 (1.475–1.798) times after adjusting for covariates 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 2D). The high PRS with seven SNPs also showed a positive association with the obesity risk, but the ORs of the 7-SNP model were slightly smaller than those in the 5-SNP model (Figure 2D).<SEP>The PRS was significantly associated with the BMI: 1.43-fold and 1.55-fold in men and women, respectively, after adjusting for the covariates (Table 5). On the other hand, PRS was not related to waist circumference and SMI after adjusting for the covariates, including BMI. Interestingly, the fat mass was positively associated with fat by 1.46-fold only in men but not women after adjusting for covariates, including the BMI (Table 5). In addition, PRS was not related to menarche and menopausal age in women after adjusting for the covariates. <SEP>3.4. Interaction of PRS and Nutrient Intake in Obesity Risk<SEP>Interestingly, initial menstruation age interacted with PRS for the obesity risk. In participants with an early menarche age, the BMI was higher than those with late menarche age. The impact of PRS was much higher in the participants with early menstruation than those with late menstruation (p = 0.027; Figure 3A). The adjusted ORs and 95% CI were 2.38 and 1.608–2.841 in the participants with early menstruation and 1.562 and 1.405–1.738 in those with late menstruation, respectively (Table 6).<SEP>A plant-based diet intake showed an interaction with the PRS to influence the obesity risk (Table 6). In a low plant-based diet intake, the genetic impact was lower for BMI, whereas the participants with a high PRS had a higher BMI than those with a low PRS with a high plant-based dietary intake (Figure 3B). Adults with a high PRS were protected against the obesity risk in a high plant-based diet (Table 6). The nutrient intake and other dietary patterns did not show any interactions with the PRS to affect the obesity risk.<SEP>Fried-food intake exhibited an interaction with the PRS (Table 6). The high fried-food intake participants had a higher BMI, but the PRS impact was offset in the participants with a high fried-food intake (Figure 3C). Thus, fried-food intake should be avoided to protect against obesity, even though a high PRS did not significantly exacerbate the obesogenic effects of fried-food intake (p = 0.035).","4. Discussion<SEP>GWAS studies have previously identified genetic variants associated with obesity risk, but few studies have been conducted to identify the genetic variant−genetic variants and genetic variant−lifestyle interactions. The present study showed the participants with high PRS of appetite-related genes, mainly MC4R pathway-related genes, including SEC16B_ rs543874, BDNF_ rs6265 DNAJC27_ rs713586, MC4R_rs17782313, GIPR_ rs1444988703, increased the obesity risk by 1.6-fold. The participants with early menarche age, low plant-based diet, and high fried-food intake had a higher PRS impact on the obesity risk than those with late menarche age, high plant-based diet, and low fried-food intake. Therefore, the participants with high PRS, especially with early menstruation, could be at obesity risk, and they should consume a plant-based diet with fewer fried foods to prevent obesity risk.<SEP>The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, a central organ for regulating energy balance, has a range of receptors for appetite-regulating hormones and neurotransmitters. Leptin, insulin, ghrelin, cholecystokinin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 modulate the activation of orexigenic neurons and anorexigenic neurons of the hypothalamus. When the hunger center is activated, food intake increases and energy expenditure decreases. The leptin−melanocortin signaling system is the critical appetite regulatory system: leptin activates proopiomelanocortin, an α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone that activates the melanocortin type 3 (MC3R) and MC4R. MC4R stimulates the anorexigenic effectors and suppresses the orexigenic effectors. Therefore, the MC4R-related pathway is involved in obesity risk.<SEP>The present study shows that MC4R mutations are reported to develop obesity ranging from 0.5–5.8%. A GWAS study in Danish, Icelandic, Dutch, European Americans, and African American adults has shown that SNPs in the FTO, MC4R, BDNF, and SH2B1 genes are highly associated with obesity risk via modulating leptin secretion to induce leptin resistance in different ethnicities. In Chinese people, SEC16B is involved in the serum leptin concentration connected with FTO, MC4R, and BDNF involved in the appetite regulation in the hypothalamus. SEC16B is expressed in various tissues and is also involved in transporting appetite-regulatory peptides, including neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin. It acts in the adipose tissues to secrete obesity-related molecules that regulate fat mass. Adults with the risk alleles of MC4R_rs17782313 have higher ghrelin concentrations, and more than 50% have severe binge eating issues. The genes and genetic variants were associated with high BMI in middle-aged adults and the elderly. Furthermore, afamelanotide stimulates BDNF expression in the brain by activating MC4R to mediate neurogenesis and cognitive function in an Alzheimer’s disease animal model. The present study showed that MC4R_rs17782313 and BDNF_rs6265 were included in the best genetic model for obesity. The two SNPs might interact with each other to influence the obesity risk through modulating appetite.<SEP>This study demonstrates that genetic factors can interact with environmental factors in obesity development, and obesity can be prevented with high compliance using genetic and environmental interaction results. The association of fat and carbohydrate intake with obesity remains controversial, although the daily energy intake was positively associated with obesity risk. Furthermore, food intake has shown controversial results for obesity risk. The present study reported that DII, a dietary inflammatory index, and sugar-containing food intake were not involved in the obesity risk, while fried-food intake was positively associated. In contrast, the serum hs-CRP concentrations have a positive association with obesity. Therefore, obesity may be associated with inflammation, but the DII itself may not fully represent the inflammation status in the present study.<SEP>Dietary patterns have been reported to influence obesity risk. A plant-based diet was inversely associated with the obesity risk, whereas a Western-style diet had a positive association in the present study. In the present study, the participants with a high intake of plant-based foods had a higher energy intake with a high intake of fat and low intakes of carbohydrates. Thus, the intake of a plant-based diet might reduce the obesity risk despite the higher energy intake. The previous study has also shown that a plant-based diet is inversely related to liver fat deposition in children aged 6 to 15. These results suggest that the reduced obesity risk may be related to the gut microbiome because a high plant-based diet had a higher dietary fiber intake, but a Western diet had a lower fiber intake. Previous studies reported that the participants with vegetarian-type diets have more of the Prevotella enterotype in the Western countries, whereas among Koreans, those with a rice-based diet have a higher level of Prevotella. Therefore, a plant-based diet may be intermediate between a rice-based diet and a balanced Korean diet. Thus, a plant-based diet improves obesity risk potentially by promoting the gut microbiota balance.<SEP>A few studies have shown the genetic variants−diet interaction for obesity risk. Previous studies have not shown that MC4R, BDNF, SEC16B, and FTO genetic variants interacted with the food and nutrient intake, even though nutrient interactions with the genetic variants of other genes, such as GRB14, LYPLAL1, LRRN6C, and MTIF3, have been reported. In the present study, a plant-based diet and fried-food intake interacted with a high PRS, but other lifestyle-related factors did not interact with the PRS. The fried-food intake increased BMI, but the PRS impact was attenuated in the high intake group of fried foods, even though BMI was higher in the high intake group of fried food in the adults regardless of PRS. A high intake of fried foods has been shown to be related to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer risk. Therefore, people with high PRS may have a higher risk of obesity and other metabolic disorders, and they need to consume less fried foods to reduce obesity risk.<SEP>The merit of this study was to show that the PRS of the appetite-related genetic variants increased obesity risk, and a high PRS had a higher impact on obesity with an early menarche age, high fried-food intake, and low plant-based diet intake. This result can be used as a basis of personalized nutrition for obesity risk. This study had some limitations. First, this was a case-control study that did not show a causal relationship. Second, although the results were analyzed from a large cohort, this study was not conducted with a survey design. Lifestyles and nutrient intake were self-reported, and they might include some biases. Finally, the PRS model employed in this study probably underestimates the true genetic impact on obesity since a limited number of genes were included. This model was clinically used as a tool in personalized nutrition and only included well-described SNPs associated with known metabolic pathways. Future research should be conducted with a total PRS that evaluates the complete impact of genetics on obesity among Koreans.<SEP>In conclusion, a PRS model using SEC16B_rs543874, DNAJC27_rs713586, BDNF_rs6265, MC4R_ rs6567160, and GIPR_rs1444988703 had gene−gene interactions which elevated the obesity risk. In addition, the PRS interacted with the menarche age in adult women with high PRS: those who had an early menarche age showed an elevated obesity susceptibility in later life. PRS also interacted with a plant-based diet and fried-food intake. Therefore, people with high PRS, especially women with early menarche, need to consume a more plant-based diet with fewer fried foods to decrease their obesity risk. These results can be applied to personalized nutrition for protecting against obesity from childhood.<SEP>Publisher’s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",36342,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
22891219,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased substantially in the U.S. and worldwide, and the health burden of obesity-related complications has grown accordingly. Obesity is primarily determined by both genetic and lifestyle factors, including diet, as well as their interactions. In the past few years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified a group of genetic loci associated with BMI and obesity risk. Among them, the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) locus shows the strongest effect. Accumulating evidence has suggested that this locus is involved in the hypothalamic regulation of appetite and dietary energy intake.<SEP>Recently, several studies have examined the effect of the FTO-diet interaction on body weight, but the results are not entirely consistent. Several cross-sectional studies showed that dietary factors such as low fat intake might modify the genetic effect of FTO on BMI or fat distribution. However, the gene by diet interaction was not univocally observed in randomized intervention trials, although one study found that a Mediterranean diet intervention modified the association between the FTO variant and weight changes in a population with high cardiovascular risk. These intervention trials, however, largely are limited by relatively small sample size or the short term of follow-up. In addition, animal studies have suggested that FTO might differentially affect various body compositions and fat distribution at different depots. Few studies have evaluated systematically the effect of the FTO variant on these measurements.<SEP>The POUNDS LOST Trial thus far is the largest 2-year randomized intervention trial that tested the effect of four diets varying in proportions of fat, protein, and carbohydrate on weight loss in overweight or obese subjects. By use of the data from this trial, we evaluated whether various weight-loss diets might modify the effect of the FTO variant on weight loss and long-term changes in body composition and fat distribution.","RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS<SEP>Study population.<SEP>The POUNDS LOST Trial was conducted from October 2004 through December 2007 at two sites as follows: Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts; and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center of Louisiana State University System, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The design and sample collection have been described previously in detail. In brief, the study population was composed of 811 overweight or obese (BMI ranged from 25 to 40 kg/m2) participants aged 30–70 years. Major criteria for exclusion were the presence of diabetes or unstable cardiovascular disease, the use of medications that affect body weight, and insufficient motivation as assessed by interview and questionnaire. Among the 742 participants who were genotyped successfully, 61% were women, 80% were white, 15% were black, 3% were Hispanic, and 2% were Asian or other ethnic groups by self-report. The participants were assigned randomly to one of four diets constituting a two-by-two factorial design; the target percentages of energy derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrate in the four diets were 20, 15, and 65%; 20, 25, and 55%; 40, 15, and 45%; and 40, 25, and 35%. After 2 years, 645 participants (80% of total population) completed the trial. The study was approved by the human subjects committee at each institution and by a data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. All participants provided written informed consent.<SEP>Measurements.<SEP>In the morning before breakfast, body weight and waist circumference (WC) were measured on 2 days at baseline; 6, 12, and 18 months; and 2 years. BMI was calculated as weight by height squared (kg/m2). A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was performed on 50% of a random sample from the total study participants (n = 424), including 242 (57.1%) women, using a Hologic QDR 4500A (Waltham, MA). Total fat mass (kg), total fat-free mass (FFM; kg), whole body total percentage of fat mass (FM%) and percentage of trunk fat were obtained once at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years. Computed tomography (CT) was used in 50% of a random sample from those participants who had DEXA scans, resulting in a sample of 25% of the total participants (n = 195), including 113 (58.2%) women. Total adipose tissue (TAT) mass, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass, deep subcutaneous adipose tissue (DSAT) mass, and superficial adipose tissue (SAT) mass within the abdomen were measured by standard methods, once at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years. Because of radiation exposure, premenopausal women would not subject themselves to CT scans. A series of eight single-slice images were obtained every 10 cm from 2 below and 5 above the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae interspaces. These contiguous cross-sectional images were analyzed, and then the total volume was calculated from the individual slices. In this analysis, we only included data at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years with all the outcomes because the DEXA and CT scans were only performed at these three time points.<SEP>Genotyping.<SEP>DNA was extracted from the buffy coat fraction of centrifuged blood using the QIAmp Blood Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1558902 was selected because it had emerged as the top variant of FTO locus for BMI and WC in recent obesity-related GWAS. The SNP was genotyped successfully in 742 of 811 total participants and 603 of 645 participants who completed the trial using the OpenArray SNP Genotyping System (BioTrove, Woburn, MA). Of the 424 participants who received DEXA scans, 391 were genotyped at baseline, and 224 participants who completed the trial were genotyped. Of the 195 participants who received CT scans, 175 were genotyped at baseline and 105 participants who completed the trial were genotyped. The genotype success rate was 99% in available DNA samples. Replicated quality control samples (10%) were included in every genotyping plate with greater than 99% concordance. The allele frequency in two major ethnic groups (white and black) was compatible with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05).<SEP>Statistical analysis.<SEP>The primary outcomes were changes in body weight and WC. Secondary outcomes were changes in body composition including total fat mass, FFM, FM% and percentage of trunk fat, and fat distribution (TAT, VAT, SAT, and DSAT). Data were pooled from the diets for the two factorial comparisons: low protein versus high protein and low fat versus high fat. Because the majority of the study population were white (80%), we also analyzed the main effects and interactions among white participants separately. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and comparison of categorical variables at baseline were assessed with χ2 test. Differences in continuous variables at baseline were tested using ANCOVA, with adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity. The main effects of genotype and diet intervention on outcome changes at 6 months and 2 years were analyzed using general linear regression models, with adjustment for covariates including age, sex, ethnicity, carbohydrate, the baseline value for the respective outcome, and baseline BMI. We excluded individuals with missing measures at each time point in the analysis. Moreover, to analyze the potential interactions between genotype and diet intervention, an interaction product term of genotype-diet was included in the models. In a secondary analysis, we used linear mixed models, with time as a repeated measurement factor, to test genetic associations with the trajectory of changes in outcomes in the participants who provided measurements at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years in each of four diet groups over the 2-year intervention by including genotype-time interaction terms. Because an additive genetic effect was reported in the original large-scale GWAS in which the SNP was identified, additive models were analyzed for genotype. All reported P values were two-sided and a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were analyzed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).","RESULTS<SEP>Characteristics of study population.<SEP>Baseline characteristics of participants according to the FTO rs1558902 genotype are presented in Table 1. The minor allele frequency (MAF; A allele) was 0.402 in the total population. The genotype frequencies were significantly different among the sexes and ethnicities. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, all variables such as weight, BMI, WC, body composition, and fat distribution had no association with genotype at baseline. Baseline characteristics were similar among participants in the four diet groups (Supplementary Table 1). Likewise, no associations between the FTO genotypes and these measures were observed in the white participants (data not shown).<SEP>Effects of FTO rs1558902 genotype on weight and waist: overall and two-factorial analysis.<SEP>After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline BMI, and diet groups, no main effects of the FTO rs1558902 genotype on changes in weight or WC were found in any participants at 6 months and 2 years (data not shown). We next examined the genetic effects on changes in weight and WC following a two-factorial design: low versus high fat and low versus high protein. We found that the risk allele (A) was significantly associated with a 1.51-kg greater weight loss in the high-protein group (P = 0.010), but not in the low-protein group, by the end of intervention (2 years). The changes in weight and WC were less significant at 6 months (Table 2). In subgroups treated by different proportions of dietary fat, we did not find significant genetic effects on changes in weight and WC (all P > 0.05; Supplementary Table 2).Similarly, in the white participants, we found the risk allele was associated with a 1.38-kg greater weight loss in the high-protein group at 2 years (P = 0.028), but not in other subgroups (data not shown).<SEP>The FTO rs1558902 genotype and changes in body composition by diet intervention.<SEP>Consistent with the observations of change in body weight, we found that the rs15589002 risk allele (A) was associated with greater loss of total fat, FFM, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat at 2 years in the high-protein group, but not in the low-protein group (Table 2). Tests for genotype-diet protein interaction were significant on changes in FFM and FM% (for interactions, P = 0.034 and 0.049, respectively) adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, carbohydrate, baseline BMI, and the baseline value of body composition (Fig. 1). At 6 months, we only observed gene by protein diet interaction on changes in FFM (P = 0.008 for interaction; Fig. 1). The risk allele carriers in the high-protein group had greater loss of FFM than noncarriers, but those in the low-protein group had less loss of FFM compared with noncarriers (Table 2).<SEP>We did not find significant genetic effect and interactions between the FTO variant and dietary fat intake on changes in body composition in total participants (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The results in the white participants were similar (data not shown).<SEP>The FTO rs1558902 genotype and changes in fat distribution by diet intervention.<SEP>We further analyzed body fat distribution measured by CT. At 2 years, we found significant interactions between the FTO rs1558902 genotype and protein diet intervention on changes in TAT, VAT, and SAT (for interactions, P = 0.001, 0.012, and 0.002, respectively; Fig. 2). The risk allele (A) was associated with greater loss of TAT and VAT in the high-protein group but with less loss of TAT and SAT in the low-protein group (Table 2). At 6 months, gene-protein interactions were observed on changes in TAT and SAT (for interactions, P = 0.026 and 0.050, respectively; Fig. 2), and the risk allele carriers in the high-protein group had greater loss of TAT and VAT than noncarriers, but those in the low-protein group had less loss of SAT than noncarriers (Table 2).<SEP>We did not find significant genetic effects and interactions on changes in fat distribution in subgroups treated by different dietary fat components (all P > 0.05; Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2).Similar results were found in the white participants (data not shown).<SEP>The trajectory of changes in body composition and fat distribution by FTO rs1558902 in response to protein diet.<SEP>In a secondary analysis, we used linear mixed models to assess the genotype by time effect over the 2-year trial in those treated by the four dietary compositions. We observed significant genotype-time interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat in response to the high-protein diet. When assigned to the high-protein diet, participants who carried the AA genotype had greater loss in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat than those without this genotype. No genotype-time interaction on changes in body composition was found in the low-protein group (Fig. 3).<SEP>We also observed significant genotype-time interactions on changes in fat distribution in response to the low- and high-protein diets. Participants with the AA genotype had greater decrease in fat distribution in response to the high-protein diet compared with those without this genotype. In contrast, participants with the AA genotype were associated with less loss in TAT and SAT in response to the low-protein diet (Fig. 4).<SEP>We found genotype-time interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat in response to the low-fat diet (Supplementary Fig. 3), but no genotype-time interactions on changes in fat distribution were found in response to the low- or high-fat diets (Supplementary Fig. 4).A similar trend was observed in the white population (data not shown).","DISCUSSION<SEP>In the POUNDS LOST Trial, a 2-year, randomized weight-loss intervention, we found that dietary protein intake significantly modified the effect of an FTO variant on changes in body composition and fat distribution. Carriers of the risk allele (A allele) of the rs1558902 genotype had a greater loss of weight and regional fat in response to a high-protein diet compared with noncarriers, whereas an opposite genetic effect was observed regarding changes in fat distribution in response to a low-protein diet. Our data indicate that the modification effects of dietary treatment were more evident with prolonged intervention. We did not observe significant modification of dietary fat intake on the genotype effects.<SEP>The rs1558902 genotype was reported to show the strongest association with obesity in the European and other ethnic populations, and it has strong linkage disequilibrium with other obesity-associated FTO variants such as the rs9939609 genotype. In this study, the MAF of the polymorphism in all participants was similar to those in the HapMap CEU population (0.45). At baseline, no significant difference was observed in anthropometrics and metabolic estimates, body composition, or fat distribution across genotypes. The lack of association with baseline BMI is probably largely due to the fact that the participants were all overweight or obese, so that the groups had relatively smaller variances in BMI than the general population.<SEP>Several cross-sectional studies showed that diets might modify the effect of the FTO variant on obesity, but the data from randomized diet intervention trials are conflicting and limited by small sample size or short term of follow-up (Supplementary Table 3). Two lifestyle intervention studies with follow-up periods of 9 and 12 months did not find significant influence of FTO polymorphisms (rs8050136 and rs9939609) on changes in body weight or fat distribution related to diet among 200 overweight and obese individuals treated by diets with reduced fat and increased fiber or reduced fat and sugar. In another 10-week, hypo-energetic diet intervention with either low fat or high fat content, the FTO variant had an effect on only changes in resting energy expenditure, insulin release, and sensitivity, not on weight loss. Similarly, in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, the FTO variant did not modify weight change by individualized diet intervention with reduced fat and increased fiber during the 4-year follow-up of 255 individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. In our study, when macronutrient components of diets were not considered, we found no main effects of the FTO variant on changes in weight and body composition during the intervention.<SEP>Grau et al. reported that dietary fat/carbohydrate content interacted with some genetic variants including the FTO variant on weight reduction or change in obesity-related phenotypes. In our study, we also found significant gene-diet interactions on changes in body composition and fat distribution. However, our data indicate that it is the dietary protein component, rather than dietary fat, that might drive the observed interactions. In previous studies, high-protein intervention has been found to result in a greater weight loss and abdominal fat mass. Our results suggest that individuals with a certain genetic background may benefit more in weight loss by following a high-protein diet. The mechanism of how protein intake interacts with FTO genotype is unclear.<SEP>Our data indicate that the genetic effects on certain fat compositions or depots may be more evident than the effects on overall adiposity. Functional studies have shown that the loss or overexpression of FTO in mice led to different changes in fat distribution at different dissected sites. FTO mRNA expression was fat depot–specific and was found to differ significantly in subcutaneous fat and in visceral fat. Epidemiological studies also have shown that FTO variants are significantly associated with distribution of fat depots. Taken together, these data suggest that genetic effects of FTO on the change of fat mass at various sites may be different, and changes in anthropometrics may not adequately reflect the effects of an FTO variant.<SEP>The genetic effect in our study seemed to be more evident at 2 years than that at 6 months. The results were in line with a recent study by Razquin et al. in which it was found that FTO risk allele carriers had the highest weight reduction after 3 years of intervention with a Mediterranean diet compared with several short-term diet interventions (less than 1 year) in which no influence of an FTO variant on weight loss or change in fat distribution was found. Of note, between 6 months and 2 years of intervention in our trial, the participants regained weight. Therefore, it seems that the genetic variant might affect both the reduction and regain of the adiposity measures. These data suggest that the modification effects of diet treatment on an FTO genotype effect are more likely to be identified in long-term interventions.<SEP>Several limitations need to be considered when interpreting our findings. Even though our study is thus far the largest and longest diet intervention weight-loss trial, the relatively small sample size of the subgroups may limit the power to detect very moderate genetic effects or interactions. We did not adjust for multiple testing according to the recommendation by Rothman and Lai et al. because outcomes and the repeated measurements at 6 months and 2 years were highly correlated in our study. Overadjustment for multiple comparisons may increase the type II error and reduce power to detect significant differences. In addition, the majority of the total participants were white, and further studies are needed to determine whether our findings are generalizable to other ethnic groups. Even though the randomized clinical trial is thought to be the best model to test gene-environment interactions, we acknowledge that replication in diverse populations is needed to verify our findings.<SEP>In summary, we found that dietary protein intake might modify the FTO variant’s effect on changes in body composition and fat distribution. A high-protein diet may be beneficial for weight loss in individuals with the risk allele of an FTO variant. Further studies are warranted to verify our findings and explore the potential mechanisms.<SEP>This article contains Supplementary Data online at http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1799/-/DC1.",20526,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS', 'FOODIN']"
21186106,"Introduction<SEP>Within the complex etiology of cardiovascular diseases and obesity, it has long been known that lower educational level is a shared risk factor. Especially notable has been the recent increasing prevalence of obesity in subjects of lower educational level/socioeconomic status. Although several studies have been carried out to investigate the differences in diet, exercise and other environmental variables among subjects with different educational level that may influence the risk of obesity, there have been very few studies that have investigated the genetic influence on the association between education and obesity-related variables, most of them being heritability studies conducted on twins. Thus, a study undertaken on Danish twins, investigated how genetic and environmental variance in physical health differed with level of education, and concluded that education reduced the influence of genetic susceptibility to poor health, suggesting that this might take place because more educated people manage their environments better to protect their health. Concerning the analysis of specific loci, there is one study showing that a low educational level aggravated the association between the rs3809508 neuromedin B single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the risk of obesity in the HELENA study.<SEP>Genetic variation, namely the rs9939609 SNP, at the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene has been frequently associated with common obesity; however, not all the studies undertaken have found statistically significant associations between the FTO variant alleles and greater body mass index (BMI). Even in studies which have found significant associations between the rs9939609 and BMI, differences have been detected in the magnitude of the association depending on the population analyzed. These studies are done with different ethnical backgrounds as well as with different demographic characteristics. Among the demographic characteristics, some studies have suggested that the effect could be greater in children and adolescents and lesser in elderly people. Among the environmental interactions that may modulate the association of the FTO SNP with BMI, physical activity (PA) has been the most commonly studied. Several studies have found that low PA accentuates the effects of FTO risk-allele, whereas, high PA attenuates the association of that allele with greater BMI. Nevertheless, not all the studies have been able to observe that modulation. Although PA has been related to education in some studies [for example, participation in exercise and sports was positively associated with educational level in Eurobarometers ], there is no published study that has examined the interaction between the FTO gene variation and education in determining the risk of obesity.<SEP>Taking into account the diversity of effects of the FTO SNP on BMI depending on the characteristics of the population as well as the gap in knowledge regarding the modulation of this association by education status, our aims were: 1) To study the association between the FTO rs9939609 SNP and BMI in three independent samples of the same Mediterranean population that differ in socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics in order to estimate the homogeneity/heterogeneity of the association; 2) To study the interaction of educational level on the association of the rs9939609 SNP with BMI and obesity in these samples.","Methods<SEP>Subjects and study design<SEP>We included Caucasian subjects from three independent Mediterranean samples 1580 subjects from the general population (GP), 203 severely obese patients from a hospital (OHP) and 1027 elderly subjects with high cardiovascular risk (HCR). All participants gave their informed consent. The ethics committee of the University of Valencia approved the studies.<SEP>Subjects from the GP<SEP>We studied 1580 unrelated subjects (757 men and 823 women) participating in a previous study (EPIGEM Study) aimed at ascertaining the prevalence of both genetic and environmental cardiovascular risk factors in this Mediter-ranean population. Participants (aged 18–70 y; mean age: 41.2±13.8 y) were apparently healthy, unrelated subjects residing or working in the Valencia region (East Mediterranean coast of Spain), recruited between 2000 and 2006.<SEP>OHP<SEP>We studied 203 unrelated obese patients (37 men and 166 women), aged 18–68 y (mean age: 46.3±14.7 y) referred to the Endocrinology Unit of the University General Hospital in Valencia (from May 2001 to June 2003), for diagnostic and weight reduction treatments related to obesity and who agreed to take part in the study, as previously described. Prevalence of morbid obesity (BMI> = 40 kg/m2 in this sample was 51%).<SEP>Elderly subjects with HCR<SEP>1027 unrelated subjects (325 men and 582 women), aged 55–80 y (mean age: 67.3±6.4 y) who participated in the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) study and were consecutively recruited in the Valencia Region from October 2003 to December 2008 were included. Details of this study have been previously reported. Briefly, participants were elderly community-dwelling persons who fulfilled at least 1 of 2 criteria: type 2 diabetes or 3 or more cardiovascular risk factors (current smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, overweight, or a family history of premature cardiovascular disease).<SEP>Anthropometric and clinical determinations<SEP>Anthropometric variables were directly measured by trained nurses in the three populations by standard techniques. Height andweight weremeasured with light clothing and no shoes. Obesity was defined as BMI> = 30 kg/m2. Waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest using an anthropometric tape. Fasting venous blood was collected.<SEP>Education, physical activity and other lifestyle variables<SEP>The same questionnaires were used for both the GP and OHP, and data of demographic variables, education, and PA, were assessed as previously reported. Questions on education were divided into 5 categories illiterate, primary, secondary, university I (3 years), and university II (5 years or more), and further recoded into 3-categories: primary, secondary and university. PA was estimated from questions about regular leisure time physical activities (aerobics, basketball, cycling, gymnastics, running, soccer, squash, swimming, tennis, volleyball, and others), as well as the average number of hours per week spent on each activity. According to the type and time, subjects were categorized as sedentary (no physical exercise), moderate (1 sport less than 3 h/wk) and high (1 sport more than 3 h/ wk or more than 2 sports per week), as previously described. For interaction analyses, PA was also dichotomized as sedentary versus active (moderate and high).<SEP>In the HCR subjects, socio-demographic factors and lifestyle variables were assessed at baseline as previously detailed. Questions on educational level were also asked in the form of 5-answer options. They were then divided into three categories (primary, secondary and university). PA was estimated by the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity questionnaire, in its version validated in Spain. Thus the total amount of PA performed during the preceding year was assessed from a list of activities, and daily average energy expenditure in Kcal/d was calculated. Population tertiles of total PA were considered (<106 kcal/d, 106–213 kcal/d and >213 kcal/d).<SEP>DNA extraction and genotyping<SEP>Genomic DNA was isolated from blood. The rs9939609 FTO SNP was determined in the same laboratory using a 7900HT Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies) and a fluorescent allelic discrimination TaqMan assay by standard procedures. For quality control purposes, 10% of randomly selected samples were genotyped a second time, and there were no discrepancies. All populations were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.868 for GP, P = 0.226 for OHP and P = 0.348 for HCR subjects).<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>χ2 tests were used to test differences in percentages. We applied analysis of variance and the t tests to compare crude means. Co-dominant, dominant and recessive models were tested. Multivariate adjustment was undertaken by linear regression analysis. To study gene–environment interactions in determining BMI, we used multivariate linear regression models, including main effects and interaction terms. Regression coefficients and adjusted means for each predictor were estimated. Logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of obesity associated with the presence of each genetic variant as compared with the wild-type. Multiple logistic regression models were also fitted to control for the effect of covariates and effect modifiers as well as to test the interaction between the SNP and educational level and PA. Analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Significance was considered at the level of P < 0.05.","Results<SEP>Association between the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism and anthropometric variables<SEP>General characteristics of the study subjects are shown in Table 1. GP subjects had a mean age 41.2±13.8 y and BMI of 26.0±4.7 kg/m2 (prevalence of obesity was 17.7%). The mean age of OHP was slightly higher (46.3±14.7 y) with a very high mean BMI (41.8±8.4 kg/m2). The educational level of OHP was lower than that of the GP. In elderly HCR subjects mean BMI was 30.1±4.0 kg/m2, with a high prevalence of obesity (49.1%) and lower educational level than the GP.<SEP>We observed (Table 2) that the FTO SNP was strongly associated with greater weight, BMI and waist circumference in the GP. This association followed a co-dominant model, BMI increasing by +0.5 (SE: 0.2) units per risk-allele (P = 0.009). A greater prevalence of obesity was also observed when A-allele carriers were grouped and compared with TT subjects (P = 0.038). These results maintained statistical significant following adjustment for sex, age, smoking and diabetes. In OHP, the association of the FTO SNP with anthropometric measurements was recessive. No differences were observed between the TT and TA subjects, the presence of two A-alleles being necessary in order to observe higher differences in means. In HCR subjects no significant differences in means of weight, BMI and waist circumference depending on the FTO SNP were observed. Neither was any association with the prevalence of obesity found. The statistical significance of results did not change after multivariate adjustment for sex, age, smoking and diabetes. Further adjustment of these models for PA and education did not change the statistical significance of results.<SEP>Interaction between the FTO SNP and education in determining BMI and obesity risk<SEP>Firstly, we studied the interaction between educational level expressed in 3-categories and the FTO SNP in determining BMI in the GP (Fig. 1A). The interaction term between the FTO SNP and education did not reach the statistical significance (P = 0.152) when 3-categories of educational level were considered. Thus, in the stratified analysis by educational level, we observed that the association between the A-allele and higher BMI in the GP was present in individuals with primary (P = 0.029) and secondary studies (P = 0.028), but not in university level subjects (P = 0.786). Hence, we decided to group primary and secondary studies together and to create a variable with 2-categories: non-university and university studies. This variable presented a statistically significant interaction term with the FTO SNP (P for interaction 0.048) in determining BMI in the GP (Fig. 1B). In OHP, this interaction was also studied, but no AA individuals with university studies were found. OHP were analyzed jointly with the GP, introducing population origin as a covariate in the statistical model. Again, a statistically significant interaction term (P = 0.043) was obtained between the FTO SNP and educational level in determining BMI (Fig. 1C). In the stratified analysis, the FTO SNP was associated with higher BMI in non-university individuals (P < 0.001), but not in university level subjects (P = 0.760). In elderly subjects with HCR (Fig. 1D), no statistically significant interaction of education with the FTO SNP in determining BMI was detected (P for interaction 0.839). The statistical significance of the interactions terms did not change after additional adjustment of the corresponding models for PA. Moreover, we studied the interaction between the FTO SNP and PA on BMI (Supplementary Fig. S1) and did not observe any significant interaction term between PA levels (sedentary versus active) and the FTO SNP in determining BMI in the GP (P = 0.617). However, in HCR subjects, we found a statistically significant interaction term (P = 0.045) when we considered the first tertile of PA (sedentary) versus the others. The statistical significance of the interaction terms between education and the FTO SNP did not change after additional adjustment for the interaction between FTO and PA (not shown).<SEP>In terms of obesity, we found a clear inverse association between education and obesity risk in the GP (Table 3). Subjects with university education had a lower obesity risk (OR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.25–0.54) than did subjects with primary studies. Likewise, AA subjects had a higher obesity risk than TT homozygotes. No significant association was found for TA subjects in the whole population. On analyzing the interaction term between the FTO SNP and education, we found a statistically significant interaction (P for interaction: 0.020) in determining obesity in the GP. In the stratified analysis by educational level in the GP we observed that in individuals without university studies, then FTO SNP was associated with higher obesity risk both in TA (OR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.09–2.23) and in AA subjects (OR: 2.01; 95%CI: 1.27–3.26). However, in individuals with university studies, no significant associations between the FTO SNP and obesity risk were found, and even a change in the direction of the effect associated with the A-allele was detected. In the joint analysis of both the GP and OHP, we also observed a statistically significant interaction term between education and the FTO SNP in determining obesity risk (P for interaction = 0.023). No significant interaction was obtained in the HCR subjects (P = 0.957 for the interaction term between the FTO SNP and education). The statistical significance of these estimations did not change after additional adjustment for PA (not shown).","Discussion<SEP>In this study, carried out on 3 independent samples of the Mediterranean population, we have observed that the association between the FTO SNP and BMI is heterogeneous, depending on the characteristics of the sample and has an important modulation by education. In the GP, we have found a strong association of the A-allele with greater BMI, following a co-dominant model. In the OHP with a high percentage of morbid obesity, the FTO SNP has also been significantly associated with greater BMI, following a recessive model. However, in the elderly population no significant association was observed.<SEP>The FTO has been associated with obesity in numerous, but not all populations; however, the magnitude of the association varies depending on the sample and the ethnical background. The lack of significant association seen in the sample of elderly subjects finds support in a previous study carried out in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development which has shown that the association of the FTO SNP on BMI diminishes with age. Likewise, Qi et al., also observed a lesser association of the FTO SNP in elderly women. In addition to the age influence, other environmental variables could be having an important influence on the attenuation of the FTO association. Among these environmental variables, some significant interactions have been reported for PA. However, we have not found a significant interaction with PA in the GP in determining BMI. In the elderly population, we did find a weak interaction. One limitation of our work is that PA has been measured through questionnaires instead of directly employing objective measurements. This may have led to a misclassification of the amount of PA undertaken and could have an influence on the results obtained.<SEP>Interestingly, we did find a statistically significant interaction between the FTO SNP and education. As far as we know, this is the first time that a significant interaction between the FTO SNP and educational level in determining BMI and obesity is reported. The statistical significance of this interaction remains when the GP and OHP samples are included in a joint analysis. Although there is ample evidence that educational level is an important environmental variable associated with obesity and cardiovascular risk, there have been scarcely any studies that have examined the interaction of this variable with the effects of genetic variability in determining BMI, the exception being a recent publication by Holzapfel et al., that investigates the association between SNPs in the TMEM18 and FTO genes with educational level as well as income; however, the authors did not formally analyze the interaction between these SNPs and education in determining BMI and obesity, and we cannot compare our results with theirs.<SEP>Our findings in the GP could be explained by the fact that a higher level of education is normally accompanied by a series of healthier lifestyles. These lifestyles may mask the greater genetic susceptibility to increased weight in susceptible individuals. This less obesogenic lifestyle would not include only PA, but also diet, free time activities, stress, sleeping patterns and other variables associated with higher education.<SEP>In our elderly population, the interaction term with educational level did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to the low number of subjects with university education. However, as result of the different age mean between the GP and the elderly population, other factors related to the characteristics of the Spanish society in different generations could have an influence. Most individuals in the elderly cohort were born in the period following the Spanish Civil War (ended in 1939), when food was very scarce. This great scarcity of food may have masked the genetic effects of the A-allele, in contrast to what would be expected in a situation of greater food availability, as in later generations which are those that most make up the majority GP sample. Regarding this historical fact, a lower educational level in our elderly population used to be associated with higher level of PA as they had to do work harder, whereas a higher educational level would allow one to enjoy a more comfortable situation with more sedentary work and greater food intake. Later, this situation was reversed and currently greater food intake and sedentarism are detected in subjects with lower education.<SEP>In conclusion, we have detected heterogeneity in the association of the FTO SNP with anthropometric measurements depending on the characteristics of the sample even within a single geographical area and ethnicity. Moreover, our most important result has been the finding of an interaction between educational level and FTO SNP. Despite the important associations of the FTO SNP with anthropometric measurements in the GP, this association was not present in subjects of university education, so indicating that, although there is a certain degree of genetic susceptibility to greater weight conferred by the A-allele, subjects with higher educational level are capable of undertaking a series of lifestyle behaviours that would consist not only of more PA, but also in a series of healthier conducts that could minimize the impact of the obesogenic environment and neutralize the influence of that strong genetic susceptibility.",20105,['OBWCCE']
31478326,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) represents an important health problem, causing enormous costs and individual burden, in part due to related macrovascular and microvascular complications. A fundamental understanding of the complex pathogenesis of T2D is essential to enable earliest diagnosis and improved therapies and preventive measures. The development of T2D is closely linked with unhealthy lifestyle. Of the lifestyle factors that define the personal way of living, overweight is the major risk factor for T2D. Moreover, diet quality and physical activity (PA) are important lifestyle determinants of T2D risk independent of their effect on body weight. Susceptibility to these three modifiable lifestyle exposures, however, depends on genetic factors, which may interact with the lifestyle exposures. So‐called gene‐environment (G × E) interactions are in an epidemiological context defined as a combined risk effect of two exposures (genetic and environmental) on the outcome which is higher or less than the sum or product of the individual exposure effects. In a biological context, G × E interactions are defined as the coparticipation of two exposures in the same causal mechanism to outcome development. Identifying T2D risk subgroups based on genetic characteristics, which are especially sensitive to specific foods or nutrients, PA, or weight loss, may help to develop more individualized and targeted intervention strategies.<SEP>The evidence of G × E interaction in relation to T2D has been highlighted by several recent reviews. However, to our knowledge, no systematic review has yet been published, which has extensively studied G × E interactions of lifestyle exposures regarding the risk to develop T2D. In 2007, Frank et al published a systematic review about G × E interactions on several outcomes, but at that time only a few of the identified studies included T2D incidence as outcome. A second systematic review was published in 2017 by Li et al, however, with the focus on gene‐macronutrient interaction only. In addition, in many other nonsystematic reviews, only part of the previous weight of evidence was based on prospective studies resulting in limited evidence in terms of temporal sequence of G × E interactions on the risk to develop T2D.<SEP>Several new findings of G × E interactions on the risk to develop T2D were recently reported by prospective studies which as well have not yet been systematically summarized. Hence, we aimed to systematically review the current state of evidence relating to G × E interaction and T2D incidence. We focused on prospective studies investigating interactions of genetic variants with diet (G × D), PA (G × PA), or weight loss due to lifestyle changes (G × L).","METHODS<SEP>This review was registered in PROSPERO (www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/index.asp, identifier CRD42015023898) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.<SEP>Search strategy<SEP>Literature published through 31 January 2019 was systematically searched by three authors (S.J., J.S.Z., and S.D.) using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science, with restriction to English written publications. MeSH terms and other terms were used (list S1). Moreover, the reference lists of reviewed articles were checked to identify further eligible publications. S.J., J.S.Z., and S.D. screened titles, abstracts, and full texts in parallel, with disagreement resolved by consensus.<SEP>Study selection<SEP>Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (a) prospective study design (cohort studies and randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), (b) outcome: T2D incidence, (c) populations who are healthy or prediabetic, and (d) a description of G × D, G × PA, or G × L interaction. Non‐English literature and studies on populations with specific diseases (eg, cancer, cardiovascular diseases) and/or medications (eg, anticancer) were excluded. Moreover, we excluded studies without the application of a formal statistical test for interaction (Table S4). Studies with significant as well as not significant interaction terms were treated equally. Unpublished material was not considered.<SEP>Data extraction<SEP>Data extraction was conducted by S.J. or S.D. for the following information: title, authors, publication year, study name, study design, number of participants, ethnicities, age, gender, country, follow‐up time, exposures, exposure assessment methods, interaction terms, and P values and risk estimators of interactions.<SEP>Reporting strategy<SEP>Significant and nonsignificant interaction findings were objectively equally treated in this review.<SEP>Risk of bias and quality assessment<SEP>The risk of bias for cohort study publications was assessed by the Newcastle‐Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). Thereby, three parameters of quality were investigated: selection, comparability, and outcome assessment including eight subitems that result in a maximum judgment score of 9. Studies were classified as low quality (0 to 3 points), moderate quality (4 to 6 points), and high quality (7 to 9 points).<SEP>The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was applied to assess risk of bias for RCTs. Assessed were: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, performance and detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and funding bias. The risk of bias was judged either as low (with at least three items at low risk and one item at high risk of bias), high (with at least two items at high risk), or moderate/unclear (all other ratings).<SEP>The specific methodological quality of G × E interaction research was assessed by a score following quality criteria important for genetic association studies. This score requested eight items (Table S1): interaction as primary study goal, test for interaction, correction for multiple testing, correction for ethnicity, Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium, test for group similarity at baseline, sample size, and sufficient details of study procedure. Points ranging from −8 to 8 were given to rate quality as follows: high quality (6 to 8 points), intermediate quality (2 to 5 points), and poor quality (−8 to 1 points).","RESULTS<SEP>Out of 3002 screened publications (Figure 1), 1075 and 107 publications were assessed during abstract and full text screening. Inter‐rater agreement was κ = 0.72 and κ = 0.76 for title and abstract screening, respectively. Overall, 66 eligible publications were identified including 35 publication from cohort studies and 31 from RCTs. Among the publications from cohort studies, 28 investigated G × D, six G × PA, and one combined G × D and G × PA interactions. Among the publications from RCTs, 26 investigated G × L, two G × PA, one combined G × PA and G × D, one combined G × PA and G × L interactions, and one G × D interactions.<SEP> Characteristics of the cohort studies <SEP>Eight publications from cohort studies (Table 1) were published from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) or the Health Professionals Follow‐Up Study (HPFS), six from the Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDCS), five from European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)‐InterAct, three from the Shanghai Diabetes GWAS study, two each from EPIC‐Potsdam, the Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) and the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KOGES), and one each from several other cohort studies. In NHS and HPFS, the study sample was recruited from the health sector staff and included mainly European descendants. In DESIR, volunteers from health facilities were recruited and in all other studies participants from the general population. The sample size of the studies varied between 718 and 99 166, with a mean age of participants greater than 40 years in most studies. The follow‐up time ranged from four to 26 years, with more than 8 years in most studies. Many studies were conducted in populations of only or mainly European ethnicity. Asians were included in the Shanghai Diabetes study, KOGES, and the Korea Association Resource (KARE). <SEP>Characteristics of the RCTs<SEP>Fifteen publications of RCTs were published from the Finish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS), 14 from the American Diabetes Prevention Project (DPP), one from Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED), and one from a study in Italians from Asti. <SEP>In DPP (Table 2), 3234 participants with IGT and elevated fasting glucose were randomized into an intensive lifestyle‐intervention group and two standard lifestyle groups with administer of metformin or placebo. The lifestyle intervention included individual advices and behavior modification to reduce weight by lower fat and calorie intake and higher PA. In DPS, 522 participants with a high risk for T2D were randomized into a lifestyle‐intervention group or a usual care control group. The lifestyle‐intervention group was individually guided to reduce weight by increasing PA and following a recommended diet. In DPP and DPS, the lifestyle intervention resulted in weight reduction and lower T2D risk. <SEP>In PREDIMED, participants with high cardiovascular risk were randomized into three groups: two Mediterranean‐diet groups with extra‐virgin olive oil (1 L/week) or mixed nuts (30 g/day), and a control group with advice on a low‐fat diet. In the Italian study, 335 participants who were nondiabetic and dysmetabolic were randomized into a lifestyle group which received individualized recommendations by trained professionals to reduce metabolic abnormalities and a control group which received standard, unstructured information.<SEP>Dietary and PA exposure assessments<SEP>The investigated dietary exposure varied considerably across the publications (Figure 2, Table S6) and included individual food groups (whole grain, red meat, olive oil, dairy, and coffee), macronutrients (fiber, carbohydrate, fat, and protein), micronutrients (magnesium, iron, zinc, and vitamin A), alcohol, glycemic index and glycemic load, and dietary patterns. Dietary factors were assessed in most studies by validated food frequency questionnaire and in some by dietary history records or biomarker measurements. PA (Table S7) was assessed either by in‐person interviews or questionnaires. <SEP>Study quality and risk of bias<SEP>The NOS quality assessment resulted in high and average quality for 30 and five publications of cohort studies (Table S2), respectively. Reasons for point's deduction were mostly inclusion of selective group of volunteers and health stuffs and no statement for completeness of follow‐up.<SEP>The Cochrane risk of bias assessment resulted in low risk of bias for all RCT (Figures S1 and S2). With exception of the performance bias, all judged categories showed low risk of bias. Risk of performance bias was high in all RCT due to the nature of the lifestyle intervention complicating blinding of patient and personal.<SEP>The evaluation of methodological quality (Table S3) resulted in high quality for 26 and medium quality for nine cohort study publications. For the RCTs, 13, 17, and one publications were scored as high, medium, and low quality, respectively. Small sample sizes and missing information about Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium often reduced methodological quality.<SEP>Main findings<SEP>Of the 66 eligible publications, 19 cohort studies and nine RCT publications reported statistically significant G × E interaction (Figure 2, Tables 3, 4). In addition, some other publications observed significant T2D risk associations in some exposure strata but not in the respective other, although no statistically significant interactions were reported. Potential G × D interaction for genetic variants in the TCF7L2 gene were most frequently investigated, while findings of other genetic variants were often limited to one publication only. Furthermore, publications showed a considerable heterogeneity in investigated dietary factors.<SEP>Findings for G × D interaction on incident T2D<SEP>Interaction of fiber and whole grain with genetic variants<SEP>G × D interactions (Figure 2, Table S6) of TCF7L2 variants have been the most widely studied so far. In particular, the TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 is of interest as it is considered to be strongly associated with T2D risk and known to modify the effect of incretins on insulin secretion. Some publications reported interaction of TCF7L2 variants with fiber and whole‐grain intake on T2D incidence (Figure 2, Table S6). Increased cereal fiber intake in the Stockholm Diabetes Prevention Program (SDPP) and fiber intake in MDCS were associated with lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs7903146 CC‐genotype. Contrary, persons with the rs7903146 risk T‐allele showed a slight trend for increased T2D risk with increasing cereal fiber intake in SDPP and with increasing fiber intake in MDCS. An interaction of whole grain with TCF7L2 rs7903146 was also reported by SDPP and EPIC‐Potsdam. In line with the fiber findings, higher whole‐grain intake was in both studies associated with lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs7903146 CC‐genotype, but not among persons with the risk T‐allele. The TCF7L2 variant rs4506565 also showed interaction with cereal fiber and whole‐grain intake in SDPP and the TCF7L2 variant rs12255372 with fiber intake in MDCS. Contrary, in EPIC‐InterAct and NHS, no interactions of fiber intake with rs7903146 or rs12255372 were observed. <SEP>In MDCS, fiber intake also showed interactions with the variant rs10923931 in the NOTCH2 (involved in WNT activity) and rs4457053 in the ZBED3 (involved in WNT signaling pathway) gene but without replication in another study. Several further variants were investigated in MDCS and in EPIC‐InterAct but none showed an interaction with fiber (Figure 2).<SEP>Interaction of carbohydrates and fat with genetic variants<SEP>Interaction of carbohydrates and total fat was reported (Figure 2, Table S6) by MDCS with IRS1 rs2943641 (known to increase insulin sensitivity) and with GIPR rs10423928 (known to decrease insulin secretion). However, the IRS1 rs2943641 findings have not been validated in any other study so far, and the GIPR rs10423928 interaction findings could not be replicated in EPIC‐InterAct (12). In NHS, TCF7L2 rs12255372 showed no interaction with carbohydrates, but with glycemic load. A replication of this finding in EPIC‐InterAct failed as well. <SEP>Potential interaction of fat with genetic variants was also reported by DESIR but without external replication. In DESIR, a trend for interaction (P = .05) was observed between fat intake and the PPARγ (receptor for fatty acid storage) variants rs1801282 and rs3856806. Furthermore, H‐allele carriers of the FFAR4 variant rs116454156 (involved in Gαq signaling) had a fourfold higher T2D incidence in DESIR than RR‐allele carriers but with low fat intake only. In EPIC‐Potsdam, the CAV2 variant rs2270188 showed an interaction with total fat and saturated fatty acids but a replicate of the CAV2 findings in EPIC‐InterAct failed (12). In addition, no evidence was found in EPIC‐InterAct, NHS, and HPFS for interactions of T2D‐GRSs and IR‐GRS with fat and carbohydrates.<SEP>Interaction of alcohol with genetic variants<SEP>An interaction of alcohol with the ADH1C *1/*2 variant (Figure 2, Table S6) was reported by NHS. The ADH1C*2‐allele, which is related to a slower rate of ethanol oxidation, attenuated the lower diabetes risk among alcohol drinking US women. In contrast, such an interaction was not observed among US men. In addition, a T2D gene risk score (GRS) in NHS and HPFS and two HECTD4 variants in KoGES showed no interaction with alcohol.<SEP>Interactions of micronutrients with genetic variants<SEP>Findings (Figure 2, Table S6) indicate that the association of heme iron with T2D incidence is modified by a GRS of nine T2D associated loci and genetic variants of HFE (homeostatic iron regulator), SLC40A1 (iron‐regulated transporter), and TMPRSS6 gene (transmembrane serine proteinase). In HPFS, US men with high heme iron intake and high adherence to a T2D‐GRS had a higher T2D risk compared with other exposure strata. In NHS, higher heme iron intake was associated with increased T2D risk among women with the haemochromatosis‐associated HFE variants rs1799945 (H63D) or rs1800562 (C282Y). A similar trend was also observed in EPIC‐InterAct for women with the HFE rs1799945 variant, but the corresponding interaction was not significant. Contrary, for men in EPIC‐InterAct, this interaction was significant. In EPIC‐InterAct, heme iron intake showed also interaction with the SLC40A1 rs744653 variant in men and with borderline significance (P = .046) for the TMPRSS6 variant rs855791 in the total sample. In NHS and HPFS, rs855791 showed no interaction. <SEP>For zinc intake, DPP reported an interaction with the SLC30A8 (zinc transporter) variants rs16889462, 8_118252314, and 8_118252435, but without a clear trend for an association with T2D incidence in exposure strata. Investigations of potential interaction of some genetic variants with magnesium intake or vitamin A resulted in nonsignificant findings (Figure 2).<SEP>Interactions of individual food with genetic variants<SEP>Several individual foods have been investigated for potential G × D interaction including red meat, processed meat, olive oil, dairy, and coffee (Figure 2, Table S6). Interactions of red and processed meat with a T2D‐GRS were observed in HPFS. High intake of red and processed meat increased the risk to develop T2D among men with a high GRS, but not among men with a low GRS. Olive oil showed a marginally nonsignificant interaction (P = .05) with the GIPR variant rs10423928 in EPIC‐InterAct.24 <SEP>The association of dairy products with T2D incidence may be modified by the genetic variant rs4988235 near the lactase persistence LCT gene. In a large Danish study, carriers with the lactase persistence LCT rs4988235 T‐allele had higher T2D risk compared with persons with the lactose nonpersistence CC‐genotype when they did not consume milk. A contrasting reduced risk was observed among milk consumers. Coffee intake is hypothesized to reduce T2D risk, and findings from EPIC‐InterAct and KARE indicate that there exist interactions of coffee with some genetic variants. In EPIC‐InterAct, a stronger T2D risk lowering effect with higher coffee intake has been observed for persons with the risk T‐allele of the TCF7L2 variant rs12255372. In KARE, only coffee consumers with the rs4402960 T‐allele (IGF2BP2), rs7754840 G‐allele (CDKAL1), and rs5215 CC‐genotype (KCNJ11) had a reduced combined prediabetes and T2D risk compared with nonconsumer. Besides these findings, several other genetic variants showed no interaction with coffee, olive oil, or dairy products (Figure 2).<SEP>Interactions of dietary patterns with genetic variants<SEP>Evidence suggests that dietary patterns that reflect Western diet and enhance T2D incidence and those that reflect Mediterranean diet lower T2D incidence. In HPFS (Figure 2, Table S6), a Western dietary pattern was associated to higher T2D risk only among persons with a high T2D‐GRS, but not among persons with a low T2D‐GRS. In PREDIMED, a borderline significant interaction (P = .052) between the CLOCK variant rs4580704 and the Mediterranean diet was observed indicating lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs4580704 G‐allele compared with persons with the CC‐genotype. In EPIC‐InterAct, a Mediterranean‐diet score showed no interaction with a T2D‐GRS. <SEP>Findings for G × PA interactions on T2D incidence<SEP>Several findings indicate that the protective effect of PA on T2D risk is modified by genetic variants (Tables 3 and S7). From the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, it was reported that the association of PA with lower T2D incidence was weaker among persons with high adherence to a T2D‐GRS compared with persons with a low adherence to the T2D‐GRS. In the Swedish Malmö preventive program, the minor HNF1B rs4430796 A‐allele weakened and possibly reversed the protective effect of higher PA on T2D incidence which was observed in persons with the GG‐genotype. In NHS, women with the IRS1 rs1522813 A‐allele and low levels of PA had a higher risk to develop T2D compared with women with the GG‐genotype, but not if they were physically active. <SEP>In DPS, reduced leisure‐time physical activity (LTPA) (Table 3, S8), controlled for weight and diet changes, was associated with higher T2D incidence among persons with the PPARγ rs1801282 Ala‐ and rs17036314 C‐alleles compared with persons with the ProPro‐ and GG‐genotypes. Contrary, an increase of LTPA resulted in lower T2D incidence among persons with the ADRA2B Glu12‐allele, with the ABCC8 rs3758947 GG‐genotype and with the nonrisk haplotype of the four SLC2A2 variants rs5393, rs5394, rs5400, and rs5404, whereas persons with the risk allele seem to be unresponsive to change in LTPA. Several further investigated genetic variants showed no interaction with PA or change in LTPA (Table 3).<SEP>Findings for G × L interactions on incident T2D<SEP>Findings of DPP and DPS indicate that interaction between weight loss interventions to reduce diabetes risk and genetic variants may modify the risk to develop T2D (Tables 4 and S9). In both studies, participants with the TCF7L2 rs12255372 risk TT‐genotype showed lower T2D incidence in the intervention group than in the control group. Similar findings were reported for persons with the rs7903146 risk T‐allele by DPP and the Asti study. However, the corresponding interaction tests were not significant. <SEP>Other genetic variants have been investigated only in one RCT study populations, respectively. In DPP, the weight loss intervention was associated with a reduced T2D incidence among persons with the diabetogenic variant of ENPP1 rs1044498, and a trend for interaction was found for MC4R rs17066829. Reported interaction findings from DPS indicate that the weight loss intervention resulted in a lower T2D incidence among persons with the PPARγ rs1152003 CC‐genotype, the TNFα rs1800629 GG‐genotype, the ADRA2B Glu9‐allele, and the LIPC rs2070895 A‐allele compared with the reference genotypes. Both studies investigated also several further genetic variants, but of them none showed an indication for interaction with weight loss intervention (Table 4).","DISCUSSION<SEP>This is the first systematic review summarizing the comprehensive evidence of G × E interactions regarding T2D incidence. Of the 70 eligible publications, 28 publications reported statistically significant G × E interactions. However, the synthesis of findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the investigated genetic variants and dietary exposures. Variants of the TCF7L2 gene were most frequently investigated and showed potential interactions with whole‐grain and fiber intake, although not consistent across all studies. Other G × D interactions were reported for, eg, a western dietary pattern with a T2D‐GRS, fat and carbohydrate with IRS1 rs2943641, and heme iron with variants of HFE. G × E Interactions were also reported for PA with HNF1B, IRS1, PPARγ, ADRA2B, SLC2A2, and ABCC8 variants and for weight loss interventions with ENPP1, PPARγ, ADIPOR2, ADRA2B, TNFα, and LIPC variants. However, the evidence of the reported interactions is hitherto limited as most findings were observed in only one study, mostly of European ethnicity, without validation and replication across multiple study populations.<SEP>Findings from EPIC‐InterAct demonstrated that replication of interaction findings poses a major challenge. Surprisingly, none of the previous interaction findings for variants of TCF7L2, GIPR, CAV2, and HFE gene with various dietary factors could be confirmed in EPIC‐InterAct. One possible reason for this discrepancy might be false‐positive findings due to noncorrection for multiple hypothesis testing in initial studies. Indeed, to minimize the false‐positive rate, a correction for multiple testing becomes necessary as soon as testing is applied to more than one interrelated hypothesis in the same study sample. Interactions loosing significance after such a correction include those of TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 with fiber intake and of the CAV2 rs2270188 variant with fat intake. However, in this context, it should be noted that the correction of P values may also cause true interactions to be obscured, especially if the study population is small, and many exposures are tested hypothesis‐free. With regard to the potential interaction of TCF7L2 variants with whole‐grain or fiber intake, false‐positive findings are an unlikely explanation for the lack of reproducibility in EPIC‐InterAct given that such interaction has been observed in some populations without a multiple testing problem. <SEP>Another issue in replication of G × E interaction findings concerns exposure measurement errors and reporting bias due to self‐reports of dietary intake and PA. This may introduce variations of measured exposures across studies, and in consequence interaction findings may be distorted and thus consistent replication of interaction findings is hampered. With regard to the discrepancy between EPIC‐InterAct and earlier studies on the interaction between whole‐grain or fiber intake and TCF7L2, it is noteworthy that measurement error is a potential explanation. That the commonly observed inverse association between cereal fiber and diabetes risk has also not been detected in EPIC‐InterAct may reflect an issue to measure this exposure rather than the absence of a true association. Such a measurement error problem would largely affect also the ability to detect differences according to genetic strata.<SEP>An appropriate sample size to avoid statistical underpowered analysis is another important issue in G × E interaction research. Low statistical power reduces the chance of detecting a true interaction and thus may produce false negative findings. Genotyping errors, allele frequency, precision of environmental exposure and outcome measurement, and the strength of associations are relevant to determine an adequate statistical power. A simulation study with underlying RCT design stated that the sample size to detect interaction between two binary exposures is fourfold that to detect a main effect of the same magnitude. Indeed, it was estimated that more than 30 000 participants are needed to detect an interaction effect of 1.5 with 95% power at a significance level of 10−4. Half of the reviewed cohort study publications included study populations of smaller size (n < 5000), and none of the RCT involved more than 4000 participants. In particular, the DPS has a small sample size and thus limited statistical power to evaluate interactions. While some statistically significant interactions were observed by DPS, numerous nonsignificant findings have been published. This problem even further exaggerates given that both DPS and DPP have evaluated a large number of genetic variants for interaction with the lifestyle intervention which would require adjustment for multiple testing. Indeed, if one would adjust P values of the few reported significant interactions in DPS for all tested variants, none of the interactions would remain significant. In addition, some genetic variants (eg, rs4988235 [near LCT], rs17066829 [MC4R]), which display significant interactions with lifestyle, have previously not been identified to be associated with T2D incidence in GWAS studies. This may indicate that the effect on T2D risk emerges only as consequence of the interaction between the respective genetic variant and the respective lifestyle factor. Of note is also that DPP often applied interaction tests for three study groups: weight loss intervention, placebo, and also Metformin which could have masked potential interaction.<SEP>Although some findings are subject to statistical uncertainty and others are unconfirmed, several of the findings suggest that interactions between genetic variants and the modifiable lifestyle factors diet, PA, and weight loss may modify the risk to develop T2D. Findings indicate that a Western diet high in meat intake enhances the risk to develop T2D especially for individuals with higher genetically susceptibility for T2D. Meat intake and its components (eg, iron) alone have been linked to higher T2D risk, and it is feasible that genetic variants associated, eg, with impaired insulin sensitivity strengthen this T2D risk effect. Furthermore, a diet rich in fiber and whole grains seems to be protective regarding T2D incidence especially for people with the nonrisk alleles of TCF7L2, while those with risk alleles benefit less. Fiber‐rich diet leads to a longer retention time of food and is assumed to reduce intestinal glucose absorption, stimulate gastrointestinal hormone secretion, and modulate inflammatory cytokines. This beneficial effect may be diminished in carriers of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T‐risk allele, which has been linked to ß‐cell dysfunction, attenuated insulin secretion and incretin effects, and enhanced rate of hepatic glucose production. On the other hand, it seems that individuals with the TCF7L2 risk alleles can reduce their enhanced T2D risk by weight loss due to a healthier lifestyle. Further RCT findings suggest as well that individuals with other T2D risk variants may in particular profit from weight loss compared with individuals, which are less genetically susceptible for T2D. Reduced weight seems to mitigate the negative consequences of some T2D risk variants. G × PA interaction findings indicate that individuals at high genetic risk for T2D may profit less from the protective effects of PA on T2D risk than individuals at low genetic risk for T2D. Nevertheless, for some T2D risk variants, it was shown that affected individuals can also lower their enhanced T2D risk if they are more physically active. So far, it remains unclear whether these modifying T2D risk effects are attributable to inferior insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, and ß‐cell dysfunctions in those individuals. In summary, however, there is still a considerable need for research to validate previous results, but also to explore findings in more detail to better understand their pathophysiological impact on T2D risk.<SEP>Of note, a large proportion of current evidence rely on study samples with European ethnicities resulting in an underrepresentation of other ethnicities. This is of importance as genetic variants occur with varying frequency in the genome depending on ethnicity. For example, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant is quite common in European ethnicities but not in Asians. On the contrary, T2D‐associated variants of KCNQ1 have been found to be more common in Asians than in Danes. Accordingly, T2D risk modifying effects of G × E interactions in non‐European ethnicities and whether current findings from studies with European ethnicities are transferable to other ethnicities are of high interest for future research.<SEP>Strengths and limitations<SEP>A strength of the present review is that a comprehensive overview of G × E interaction research regarding T2D incidence is given by including the most important modifiable T2D risk factors diet, PA, and weight loss. Moreover, the focus on prospective studies strengthens the evidence in terms of temporal sequence between G × E interaction and T2D risk development. Finally, this review assessed risk of bias and specific methodological quality of included studies, which mostly showed intermediate and high quality. However, a tool, which is specifically tailored to G × E interaction studies and evaluates both the risk of bias and methodological quality, is not available, to date. The development of such a specific tool should be prioritized in future. Substantial heterogeneity was found with respect to the reported genetic variants and dietary factors, which inhibited meta‐analysis of findings and an evaluation of a possible publication bias. Although our search strategy identified several publications with significant but also nonsignificant interaction findings, a publication bias due to the preferred reporting of significant findings cannot be excluded. In addition, the generalizability of the current evidence was hampered by mostly single study findings and restriction of weight loss interventions to individuals under high risk. Moreover, our systematic review is restricted to the lifestyle factors diet, PA, and weight loss intervention only. Indeed, interactions with genetic variants have also been reported for other lifestyle factors. However, the three reviewed lifestyle factors are considered as main risk factors for T2D.",32697,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
22275441,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease resulting from lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors. Prevalence rates differ across ethnicities, with the higher rates occurring in African Americans at a prevalence of 18%. Although multiple genetic risk variants for T2D have been identified in predominantly European-derived populations, prior studies have shown little evidence for association of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in African Americans other than TCF7L2 variants. Several risk assessment studies have been performed to assess the cumulative effect of multiple T2D “risk” variants on diabetes incidence, although few have included African Americans and none have focused solely on this population.<SEP>We evaluated the cumulative risk effect of 17 index variants in a well-characterized sample of African American T2D case subjects and nondiabetic control subjects.","RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS<SEP>A total of 2,652 African Americans with T2D and 1,393 nondiabetic control subjects were evaluated. Only individuals with complete age data and proportions of African ancestry >0.50 were included. Case subjects consisted of DNA samples from 2,652 self-described African American individuals with T2D, including 1,502 ascertained through having end-stage renal disease (T2D-ESRD). Control subjects included DNA samples from 1,393 nondiabetic African Americans. Ascertainment criteria and recruitment methods have been described. Recruitment and sample collection procedures were approved by the Wake Forest School of Medicine Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Subjects were unrelated, self-described African Americans born in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, or Tennessee. Subjects with T2D-ESRD were recruited from dialysis facilities.<SEP>T2D was diagnosed as diabetes development after the age of 25 years without prior diabetic ketoacidosis. In addition, T2D-ESRD case subjects met at least one of the following criteria for inclusion: 1) T2D diagnosed ≥5 years before initiating renal replacement therapy, 2) background or greater diabetic retinopathy, or 3) ≥100 mg/dL proteinuria on urinalysis in the absence of other causes of nephropathy (set 1 case subjects). Subjects with T2D without evidence of nephropathy were recruited from medical clinics, churches, health fairs, and community resources using the above criteria (set 2 case subjects). African American control subjects without a current diagnosis of diabetes or renal disease were recruited from the community and internal medicine clinics (set 1 and 2 control subjects). DNA extraction was performed using the PureGene system (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN).<SEP>Genotyping and quality control<SEP>Seventeen index SNPs with prior compelling evidence of association with T2D in European-derived populations were genotyped in 2,652 African Americans with T2D (1,502 with T2D-ESRD, 1,150 with T2D lacking nephropathy) and in 1,393 nondiabetic control subjects. SNPs were genotyped on the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP array 6.0 (Affy 6.0) at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) as part of a Genome Wide Association Study or by using the MassARRAY genotyping system with PCR primers designed using MassARRAY Design 3.4 software (Sequenom, San Diego, CA). For 913 T2D-ESRD case subjects and 826 control subjects, 12 of 17 SNPs were genotyped on the Affy 6.0, methods and quality control for which have been previously described. SNPs had <5% missing data, and there was no significant difference in missing data between case and control subjects. Forty-six blind duplicates were included in genotyping and had a concordance rate of 99.6%. Genotyping of remaining SNPs and samples was done on the iPLEX Sequenom MassARRAY platform (Sequenom). Genotyping efficiency exceeded 93.5%, and the 95 blind duplicate samples included in genotyping had a concordance rate of >99.5%. Hardy-Weinberg proportions were >0.0005 in all case and control subjects analyzed.<SEP>Admixture estimates<SEP>Ancestral allele proportions were estimated from allele frequencies of 70 ancestry informative markers genotyped in 44 Yoruba Nigerians and 39 European Americans. Individual ancestral proportions were calculated for each subject using the frequentist estimation of individual ancestry proportion (FRAPPE) program under a two-population model. Individuals with proportions of African ancestry <0.50 were excluded from analyses. Admixture estimates were used as covariates in all statistical analyses.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>Individual SNP association analyses.<SEP>The 17 SNPs were individually tested for association with T2D in the overall cohort using a logistic regression model and then evaluated individually for association with T2D by disease type in sets 1 and 2 using the SNPGWA program (www.phs.wfubmc.edu). The additive genetic model is reported here. Set 1 and 2 results were subsequently combined in a meta-analysis. The inverse variance weighted method was implemented in METAL (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/metal/) to determine the overall association of each index variant with T2D. Because of the statistical significance and potential confounding effects, all analyses were adjusted for age (P = 5.6 × 10−119), sex (P = 1.3 × 10−4), and percentage of African ancestry (P = 1.6 × 10−4). In evaluating individual variants for association with T2D, a supplemental analysis was performed that also adjusted for BMI. Multiple comparison correction was not performed owing to the a priori hypothesis of association between the variants examined and T2D and the primary hypothesis of a single cumulative risk for these loci.<SEP>Cumulative risk scores.<SEP>Risk allele loads were initially determined in an unweighted approach where the number of risk variants carried by an individual at each SNP was summed to create a cumulative risk score based on the reported risk allele. A second risk score was calculated by a weighted method in which published effect sizes (natural logarithm of odds ratio [OR]) for each risk variant (identified in predominantly European studies) were used to adjust for the relative contribution of each SNP in the cumulative risk score calculation. In both methods, missing values were replaced with the average-risk allele load at each SNP (<4.5% missing data for all SNPs), and cumulative scores were rounded to the nearest value; the maximum possible score in each analysis was 34. Risk score differences between case and control subjects were compared using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.<SEP>Cumulative risk assessment.<SEP>Cumulative risk scores in the unweighted and weighted analyses were grouped into nine bins: ≤17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and ≥25. Binned risk scores of case and control subjects were compared using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Bins from the unweighted and weighted analyses were both tested for association with T2D using logistic regression analysis, adjusting for the covariates of African ancestry, age, and sex. Binned risk scores were modeled as ordinal categoric variables and, in a separate analysis, as nine nominal categories; the latter is less parsimonious but allows for greater flexibility (i.e., nonlinearity) in the estimation of the individual bin risk score effects. A model was computed that tested for evidence of a departure from linearity in the bin risk score effect on T2D affection status. Additional analyses included the number of TCF7L2 rs7903146 risk variants as covariates in the logistic regression model. This model estimates and tests the effect of the other loci after accounting for the strong TCF7L2 influence on risk of T2D. Theoretically, this latter model will have greater statistical power to detect the effects of the other loci.","RESULTS<SEP>Study samples<SEP>Clinical characteristics of the study samples are reported in Table 1. The case group in set 1 had more women than the control group. The mean age at enrollment for the T2D-ESRD group was higher (P < 0.05), but the age of onset of T2D in the case subjects was >7 years earlier than the age of enrollment for control subjects. Mean BMI was not significantly different between T2D-ESRD case and nondiabetic control subjects (P = 0.19). Set 2 case subjects also included a higher percentage of women. Mean age at enrollment for the T2D group was higher (P < 0.05); the mean BMI for T2D case subjects was higher than for control subjects (P < 0.05). Overall, the samples have characteristics that reflect the general population of African Americans in the southeast. The mean (SD) African ancestry proportions in the 1,502 T2D-ESRD case subjects, 1,150 T2D case subjects, and 1,393 combined control subjects were 0.79 ± 0.10, 0.78 ± 0.10, and 0.78 ± 0.09, respectively, as estimated by the frequentist estimation of individual ancestry proportion program.<SEP>Analysis of individual index variants<SEP>Risk allele frequencies and individual SNP association results are reported in Table 2. When the 2,652 T2D case subjects and 1,393 control subjects were combined, frequencies of risk alleles ranged from 8.64 to 99.97%. Notably, we observed an association of rs7903146 in TCF7L2 (OR 1.38 [95% CI 1.23–1.54], P = 1.25 × 10−8). In addition, rs10010131 in WFS1 (OR 1.13, P = 0.029), rs10946398 in CDKAL1 (OR 1.14, P = 0.014), and rs864745 in JAZF1 (OR 1.20, P = 2.30 × 10−3) were associated with directions of association consistent with prior reports in European-derived samples. SNP rs4607103 in ADAMTS9 was also associated (P = 2.40 × 10−3); however, the direction of association was opposite that reported in a European sample (OR 0.84 in this analysis). Results of an additional analysis adjusting for BMI were comparable (Supplementary Table 1).<SEP>SNPs were evaluated in case groups (sets 1 and 2) and subsequently combined in a meta-analysis to determine if associations differed between the overall and individual analyses (Supplementary Table 2). The TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 was associated in sets 1 and 2. In set 1, rs4607103 in ADAMTS9 was associated; however, the effect was in the opposite direction of that reported in a European sample. In set 2, rs10946398 in CDKAL1 was associated, as was rs864745 in JAZF1. In the meta-analysis, results were consistent with the combined analysis (described above) (Table 2); rs10010131 in WFS1, rs10946398 in CDKAL1, rs864745 in JAZF1, and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 replicated association with risk, whereas rs4607103 in ADAMTS9 replicated association in the opposite direction of effect of that previously reported in a European sample.<SEP>Cumulative risk score<SEP>Unweighted and weighted cumulative risk scores were evaluated in the overall cohort. Figure 1A and B show the percentage of T2D case and nondiabetic control subjects plotted by the cumulative risk score of each individual; values were significantly different when scores were determined by both unweighted and weighted methods (P < 0.005 for both analyses). Figure 1C and D show binned distributions of cumulative risk scores determined by unweighted and weighted methods in T2D case and nondiabetic control subjects. Figure 1C shows that the nondiabetic control group had higher percentages of individuals carrying lower-risk allele loads (<21); whereas the T2D groups generally had greater percentages of individuals carrying higher-risk allele loads. Figure 1D highlights the more pronounced distribution differences in risk allele bins between the two groups. Differences in binned distributions for both unweighted and weighted analyses were significant (P < 0.005).<SEP>Cumulative risk assessment<SEP>The OR and 95% CI for each of the nine bins assessed by the full logistic regression model and the model with adjustment for rs7903146 are represented in Fig. 2A (unweighted) and Fig. 2B (weighted); results are summarized in Supplementary Table 3. There was an increase in the OR with an increase in risk allele category. There was no evidence of departure from a linear trend in the association of the number of risk alleles and disease (P = 0.71). In a model in which data were reanalyzed, treating the risk allele categories as a continuous variable, there was evidence of an association between cumulative risk allele load and disease status in the unweighted and weighted analyses (unweighted OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.01–1.08], P = 0.011; weighted 1.06 [1.03–1.10], P = 8.10 × 10−5). In both types of analysis (i.e., nominal and ordinal categories for the count of risk alleles), association was no longer significant after adjusting for the number of TCF7L2 risk variant rs7903146: nominal analysis results (Supplementary Table 3 and Fig. 2A and B); ordinal analysis results (unweighted 1.02 [0.98–1.05], P = 0.33; weighted 1.02 [0.98–1.06], P = 0.40).<SEP>We found no evidence for interaction with age (P = 0.20), sex (P = 0.59), BMI (P = 0.47), or degree of African Ancestry (P = 0.74). Recall that only individuals with >0.50 proportions of African ancestry are included in these analyses.",,13068,['OBWCCE']
27480816,"The worldwide obesity epidemic is mainly explained by environmental and lifestyle changes that occurred in the last five decades. Increased consumption of high calorie food, lack of physical activity, and to a lesser extent sedentary behaviors, altered sleeping patterns, psychosocial stress, marital status are environmental factors predominantly attributed to driving the obesity epidemic. However, there is a large inter-individual variability in body mass index (BMI) observed among populations exposed to an obesogenic environment, ranging from pathological leanness to morbid obesity.<SEP>Heritability studies estimate that 47–90% of BMI variation is explained by genetic factors. The inherited component of obesity has been further demonstrated by the discovery of genetic variants responsible for monogenic and polygenic forms of obesity. Defects in eleven genes involved in the neuronal differentiation of the paraventricular nucleus and in the leptin/melanocortin pathway result in monogenic forms of obesity. More recently, candidate gene, custom array-wide or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 130 loci convincingly associated with BMI or obesity. Successful gene identification efforts led researchers to investigate whether gene variants may interact with specific environmental exposures to increase susceptibility to obesity. For instance, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FTO have been shown to interact with physical activity, dietary pattern or socio-economic status to increase BMI.<SEP>In a systematic review, Chiu et al. found that in a majority of studies poor glucose regulation or insulin resistance, an important predictor of type 2 diabetes (T2D), was associated with weight loss in adults. It was demonstrated that before diagnosis of T2D, weight tends to increase progressively overtime, whereas after diagnosis weight loss is common. Furthermore, insulin resistance has also been shown to promote weight gain in adolescents, but oppose further weight gain during adulthood. The diverse findings suggests that the relationship between glycemic status and BMI maybe quite complex and influenced by multiple factors. Insulin exerts its effects on weight gain by inhibiting lipolysis, thus promoting fat storage. On the other hand, weight loss may be attributed to progressive decline in pancreatic beta cell activity. Furthermore, silent T2D patients tend to lose weight prior to being diagnosed because of the presence of glycosuria, a phenomenon that is amplified in health systems not able to routinely detect T2D at an early stage. Intervention after T2D diagnosis also impacts weight trajectories. In particular, insulin or rosiglitazone medications promote weight gain, whereas lifestyle intervention, glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists or amylin analogues promote weight loss. To accurately determine the role of glycemic status in BMI evolution, before and after T2D diagnosis, more longitudinal studies are needed to clarify this complex relationship. Additionally, it is unclear whether the dynamic patterns of associations between BMI and T2D are influenced by biological factors, environmental exposures and their interactions. More specifically, understanding whether glycemic status may modify the BMI increasing effect of obesity predisposing SNPs has not been investigated to date.<SEP>Hence, we aimed to assess in 17 394 individuals from a multiethnic longitudinal study: (1) the association between baseline glycemic status and BMI level and BMI change during a 3.3 year follow-up; (2) the association between glycemic status transition and BMI level and BMI change; (3) the interaction between obesity predisposing SNPs and baseline glycemic status/glycemic status transition on BMI level and BMI change.","Material and Methods<SEP>Participants<SEP>The EpiDREAM study included 24872 individuals from 191 centres in 21 countries who were screened for eligibility to enter the DREAM clinical trial. Individuals between the ages of 18–85 years, who were deemed to be at risk for dysglycemia defined by family history, ethnicity and abdominal obesity, were screened using a 75 gram OGTT from July 2001 to August 2, 2003. None of the study participants were taking glucose lowering medication at baseline, however a subset of the IFG/IGT patients enrolled in the DREAM clinical trial were given glucose lowering medication (rosiglitazone) during the follow-up. Detailed methods and description of the study cohort have been described elsewhere. A total of 17394 subjects from six ethnic groups (East Asian, South Asian, European, African, Latin American and Native North American) and having both phenotypic and genotypic information available at baseline were included (Supplementary Figure 1). Of these 17394 individuals, 9297 have been prospectively followed for a median of 3.3 years (Supplementary Figure 1). Self-reported ethnicity has been validated in the 17394 individuals using the eigensoft software (http://genepath.med.harvard.edu/~reich/Software.htm). The EpiDREAM study was approved by local ethics committees. All experimental protocols were approved by McMaster University and were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations of McMaster University. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to participation, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>Buffy coats for DNA extraction were collected from all participants of the EpiDREAM study at baseline. DNA was extracted by the Gentra System. In total, 19 197 samples from the EpiDREAM genetic study were genotyped using the Illumina 50 K CVD Array (Supplementary Figure 1). We included 23 independent lead or proxy SNPs that reached genome-wide significant level of association (P < 5 × 10−8) for BMI and/or binary obesity status in literature and were available in the cardiovascular gene-centric 50 K SNP array (Supplementary Table 1). The 23 SNPs showed high genotyping call rates (99.96–100%; Supplementary Table 2). No deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was observed in the six ethnic groups (P ≥ 1 × 10−6).<SEP>Phenotyping<SEP>Height (m) and weight (kg) were measured in clinical centers by a research staff. Standing height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with the participant looking straight ahead in bare feet and with his/her back against a wall. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg in light clothing. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in meters (m) squared. The BMI change value was calculated as the difference of the trait from baseline to follow-up.<SEP>We used the glycemic status information at baseline and follow-up. After an overnight fast of at least 8 hours, a fasting blood sample was collected from participants. After they consumed 75 g of anhydrous glucose in 300 ml of water, an additional blood sample was drawn after 2 hours. FPG and 2hPG levels were measured using an enzymatic reference method. The 2003 ADA criteria were used to classify participants as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT), as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG), as having impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or as having T2D at baseline and at the end of the follow-up, as confirmed by an oral glucose tolerance test. NGT was defined as a fasting plasma glucose <5.6 mmol/L, IFG was defined as a fasting plasma glucose of 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L, IGT was defined as a fasting plasma glucose below 7.0 mmol/L and a 2-h glucose between 7.8 and 11.0 mmol/L, and diabetes was defined if either the fasting plasma glucose was ≥7.0 mmol/L or the 2-h glucose was ≥11.1 mmol/L.<SEP>Statistical analyses<SEP>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 14.0 and R software. Genotypes were coded as 0, 1 and 2, depending on the number of copies of the risk alleles. The risk alleles were defined as alleles associated with increased BMI/risk of obesity in literature (Supplementary Table 2). All single SNP genetic association studies were performed under an additive model. A GRS was calculated by summing the alleles that increase BMI/obesity for the 23 SNPs. We used an unweighted score as previously recommended by Dudbridge. Imputations were performed for the missing genotypes for each SNP in each ethnic group separately (n = 49 individuals; 0.012% of the total genotypes) using the arithmetic average of the coded genotypes observed for all the individuals successfully genotyped.<SEP>Linear regression models were used to analyse the association between: (1) baseline glycemic status traits (IFG/IGT, T2D, dysglycemia, FPG and 2hPG) and BMI level and BMI change; (2) glycemic status transition traits (NGT to IFG/IGT, NGT to T2D, IFG/IGT to T2D, change in FPG and change in 2hPG) and BMI level and BMI change. Interactions between: (1) baseline glycemic status traits and 23 obesity predisposing SNPs on BMI level and BMI change and (2) glycemic status transition traits and 23 obesity predisposing SNPs on BMI level and BMI change were investigated by adding an interaction term to the regression model. For all analysis, our dependent variable was either baseline BMI or change in BMI. Our independent variables were either baseline glycemic status, glycemic status transition or 23 obesity predisposing SNPs, depending on the analysis being conducted. For the baseline glycemic status those with NGT were the reference group (coded as 0; 1 = IFG/IGT, T2D or dysglycemia). Values for BMI, FPG, 2hPG, change in BMI, change in FPG, and change in 2hPG were inverse normally transformed as they did not follow a normal distribution. All the tests performed were adjusted for age, sex, and population stratification/ethnicity. Additional adjustment for randomization to thiazolidinedione after baseline was implemented when the outcome was change in BMI.<SEP>Applying a Bonferroni corrected P-value across all the outcomes reduces the chance of making type I errors, but increases the chance of making type II errors. Therefore, we applied a separate Bonferroni correction to each research question: (1) the association between baseline glycemic status and BMI, P < 6.3 × 10−3 (0.05/8), (2) the association between glycemic status transition and BMI, P < 5 × 10−3 (0.05/10) and the SNP/GRS by glycemic status interaction analyses, P < 4.2 × 10−4 (0.05/120).<SEP>Additional Information<SEP>How to cite this article: Ishola, A.

Of the 17 394 participants, 42.8%, 42.5% and 14.7% displayed normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance (IFG/IGT) or T2D, respectively. The ethnic distribution of individuals was significantly different in the NGT, IFG/IGT and T2D groups. There was a decreasing percentage of IFG/IGT in subjects of East Asian (66.9%), African (62.8%), European (61.0%), Native North American (55.8%), Latino American (55.5%) and South Asian (43.5%) ancestry (Supplementary Table 3). There was a decreasing percentage of T2D in subjects of East Asian (22.7%), African (18.0%), South Asian (16.1%), European (14.4%), Latino American (12.9%) and Native North American (11.8%) ancestry (Supplementary Table 3). Overall, IFG/IGT and T2D subjects were on average 5.5–6.5 years older than the NGT subjects. The percentage of females was higher across all glycemic statuses (60.9%), but males were more likely to be IFG/IGT or T2D in comparison to NGT counterparts (Table 1).<SEP>Effect of baseline glycemic status on BMI level and BMI change<SEP>IFG/IGT and T2D status were positively associated with BMI at baseline when compared with the NGT group (IFG/IGT: β = 0.34 ± 0.02, P = 1.35 × 10−98; T2D: β = 0.44 ± 0.02, P = 5.25 × 10−80; Table 2). There was an association between IFG/IGT status at baseline and lower BMI change during the 3.3 year follow-up in comparison with NGT subjects (IFG/IGT: β = −0.13 ± 0.03, P = 3.65 × 10−7). A significant negative association between T2D status at baseline and BMI change was also observed in comparison with NGT subjects (β = −0.34 ± 0.04, P = 1.06 × 10−19; Table 2). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and two-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) at baseline were positively associated with BMI at baseline (FPG: β = 0.19 ± 0.01, P = 1.80 × 10−145; 2hPG: β = 0.20 ± 0.01, P = 4.26 × 10−159; Table 2) and were negatively associated with BMI change during the follow-up period (FPG: β = −0.09 ± 0.01, P = 8.47 × 10−14 and 2hPG: β = −0.10 ± 0.01, P = 1.28 × 10−19; Table 2).<SEP>Effect of glycemic status transition on BMI level and BMI change<SEP>The transition from NGT to IFG/IGT was positively associated with BMI at baseline (β = 0.19 ± 0.04, P = 2.60 × 10−7; Table 3) and BMI change (β = 0.19 ± 0.04, P = 2.93 × 10−6). Compared to stable NGT, converting from NGT to T2D showed a positive association with BMI at baseline (β = 0.36 ± 0.08, P = 4.35 × 10−6) and BMI change (β = 0.38 ± 0.09, P = 2.25 × 10−5), with two fold higher baseline and delta beta values compared to that observed in IFG/IGT converters. Similarly, the transition from IFG/IGT to T2D was positively associated with BMI at baseline (β = 0.20 ± 0.03, P = 6.28 × 10−11), in comparison to stable IFG/IGT over the study period. However, this association was not significant for BMI change (β = 0.06 ± 0.04, P = 8.28 × 10−2). The change in FPG levels was significantly associated with a positive increase in BMI change (β = 0.16 ± 0.01, P = 1.1 × 10−52), but was not associated with baseline BMI (β = −0.01 ± 0.01, P = 0.52). An association between change in 2hPG levels, with BMI at baseline (β = −0.03 ± 0.01, P = 1.6 ×10−3) as well as with BMI change (β = 0.17 ± 0.01, P = 2.4 × 10−45; Table 3) was also observed.<SEP>Main association and interaction between obesity predisposing SNPs, glycemic status on BMI level and BMI change<SEP>Associations between the 23 obesity SNPs, the genotype risk score (GRS) and BMI at baseline, and BMI change are reported in Table 4. Three of 23 SNPs reached a significant association with BMI at baseline with a direction of effect consistent with published GWAS data: rs9939609 in FTO, rs2984618 in TAL1, and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 (0.04 ≤ β ≤ 0.08; 1.4 × 10−14 ≤ P ≤ 1.8 × 10−5; Table 4). The GRS was also significantly associated with an increased BMI at baseline (β = 0.018 ± 0.002) per additional risk allele, P = 6.4 × 10−14, Table 4). The 23 SNPs and the GRS were not significantly associated with BMI change (Table 4).<SEP>Interactions between obesity SNPs/GRS and traits related to glycemic status on BMI at baseline and BMI change are reported in Table 4. There was only one significant interaction between the rs1011527 SNP in LEPR and FPG on baseline BMI (P = 3.9 × 10−7). However, no significant main effect was observed for the rs1011527 SNP in LEPR on BMI with (β = −0.02 ± 0.02; P = 0.22) or without (β = −0.01 ± 0.02; P = 0.72) the interaction term in the model. Interactions between obesity SNPs, GRS and traits related to glycemic status transition on BMI at baseline and BMI change are reported in Table 5. Overall, there was no simultaneous significant main effect and interaction between glycemic status traits or transition and obesity SNPs or GRS, in relation to BMI level and BMI change.","Discussion<SEP>We sought to investigate the relationship between glycemic status and BMI evolution in the EpiDREAM study. Our results indicate that subjects with IFG/IGT or T2D at baseline have a higher BMI, compared to those with NGT, a result consistent with previous longitudinal studies in European populations but further extended to the multiethnic international EpiDREAM study. Since BMI level at baseline predicts worsened glucose homeostasis in our study, this demonstrates the important role of obesity as a driving factor for dysglycemia. Furthermore, IFG/IGT subjects gained less weight than NGT subjects during the 3.3 year follow-up period. Due to the role of insulin in fat storage, the lower weight gain observed in individuals with prediabetes may be related to the progressive decline of their beta-cell function. However, more experimental studies are needed to confirm this as the present study was not designed to examine this effect. In addition, the negative association between FPG, 2hPG and change in BMI is mainly explained by the weight loss experienced by T2D subjects (who display the higher baseline FPG and 2hPG values) during the follow-up. The weight loss observed in participants diagnosed with T2D at baseline may be attributed to glycosuria, an initial motivation to improve diet and lifestyle behaviors and medication for improvement of glycemia. A consistent observation was made in a study by Feldstein and colleagues, where a subset of multiethnic participants with T2D from the USA lost weight within the first eighteen months after initial diagnosis. However, by year three, they experienced a near complete weight regain, suggesting that sustained long term weight reduction is difficult to achieve for patients with T2D, especially in the presence of an “obesogenic” environment or weight increasing antidiabetic medication.<SEP>Increased BMI at baseline and during the follow-up period is a strong driver for the transition from NGT to dysglycemia. This has been confirmed by other studies with participants of European ancestry which show a similar outcome, however our study extends the result to a multiethnic population. Importantly, a higher BMI level at baseline but not BMI change is associated with IFG/IGT to T2D transition in our multiethnic population at risk for dysglycemia. Our finding provides support for the notion that obesity prevention may be a crucial factor in significantly decreasing the prevalence of dysglycemia worldwide. Conversely, this implies that in absence of intervention preexisting obesity plays a greater role than weight gain over time with respect to the IFG/IGT to T2D transition. Our findings suggest that preventative measures against further weight gain may be more beneficial towards individuals with NGT than those at a later disease stage. However, this is far from the reality of our current health care system, where weight loss is often proposed once individuals develop overt T2D. Collectively these findings support the notion of a strong interplay between BMI trajectories and evolution of glycemic status.<SEP>Despite the fact that subjects with NGT, IFG/IGT and T2D exhibit different BMI trajectories, no simultaneous significant main effect and interaction between the obesity predisposing SNP/GRS and baseline glycemic status on BMI was observed. The interaction observed between the rs1011527 SNP in LEPR and FPG on baseline BMI is likely spurious. We propose that this spurious interaction results from the association between the rs1011527 SNP in LEPR and the interacting variable, FPG (β:0.05 ± 0.02; P = 1.9 × 10−3; data not shown). The variation in BMI attributed to obesity SNPs is similar for subjects with NGT, IFG/IGT and T2D, even though these groups display different patterns of BMI level and BMI change across time. These results have important implications in the design of genetic association studies for obesity traits. There is a persistent belief in the field of genetic epidemiology that subjects with T2D may be excluded from genetic association studies on obesity traits. Likewise, the lack of interaction between glycemic status transition and obesity SNPs raises the possibility that the effect of obesity SNPs on BMI may be similar for those who maintain their glycemic status versus those who transition to a worsened state of glucose regulation. Consequently, if confirmed by future studies, our data may help to extend the types of designs where obesity genetic association studies can be performed (e.g. T2D case control design). We acknowledge the possibility of bias in the estimation of genetic effects when studies designed for a primary outcome (e.g. T2D in a T2D case control study) are investigated for secondary outcomes (e.g. BMI). However, these potential biases do not seem to represent a big obstacle to the discovery of novel obesity genes in practice, as illustrated by the initial discovery of the obesity gene FTO in a T2D case-control design. Our data supports the view that individuals with different glycemic statuses can be pooled together in genetic association studies for obesity traits, if appropriate adjustments for glycemic status are performed.<SEP>The strength of this study lies in the quality of the phenotypic data. Measurements were performed with a standard protocol across the entire study. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is currently the gold standard method for epidemiological assessment glycemic status. Additionally, the international longitudinal multiethnic design of EpiDREAM is ideal to assess the relationships between SNPs and BMI in interaction with the glycemic status. Likewise, the EpiDREAM cohort is enriched in subjects with newly diagnosed IFG/IGT or T2D, which optimizes the statistical power of gene x environment interaction tests in comparison to the general population in which these individuals are not as abundant. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that this particular design restricts the generalizability of our results. Other limitations include the non-exhaustive list of SNPs tested, the use of SNPs that may not represent the best proxies in non-European populations as they have been identified predominantly in European populations and the possibility that subtle true interaction effects may have been missed given the power of our study (Supplementary Figure 2). Other limitations are the small sample size of certain ethnic groups (e.g. East Asians). In addition, we did not have access to dietary and physical activity measurements at baseline and follow-up for the whole sample and were unable to adjust for these important covariates.<SEP>In summary, the interplay between glycemic status and BMI was confirmed at the epidemiological level, but no interaction between obesity predisposing SNPs and glycemic status was identified in this study. If confirmed by other studies and extended to more obesity predisposing SNPs, this finding will broaden the types of designs utilized for obesity genetic association studies. Our findings suggest that implementation of population-wide preventative measures against further weight gain may be more beneficial towards individuals with NGT than those at a later disease stage.",22715,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
21618410,"Introduction<SEP>The cure rate for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common childhood cancer, is approximately 80%. However, long-term complications of childhood ALL therapy are an emerging health concern for the growing number of survivors in our population. Neurocognitive impairment occurs in 20%-40% of ALL survivors and may result in academic and vocational compromise. Specific deficits occur in attention, processing speed, and memory, which can lead to learning difficulties and declines in global intellect. Cranial irradiation therapy, initially used as central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis, is clearly associated with neurocognitive impairment, but current treatment protocols have replaced cranial irradiation with intensive systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy in most patients. Methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy, however, has also been related to neurocognitive deficits by some groups but not others. It seems likely that the degree of neurotoxicity is an interaction of dose, route, and schedule of MTX, as well as timing of leucovorin rescue, but considerable interindividual variation in neurobehavioral outcomes is observed even in patients treated identically.<SEP>Demyelinating white matter injury and vascular damage are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic MTX-related neurotoxicity, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. MTX reversibly inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and leads to reductions in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), the primary form of circulating folate and a co-substrate for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Homocysteine and excitatory amino acids subsequently accumulate and may be toxic to the endothelium and sensitize neurons to oxidative damage, ultimately causing neuronal death and diminished myelin synthesis. Prior studies have demonstrated decreased 5-MTHF levels and elevated homocysteine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after MTX therapy, particularly in patients with acute MTX-related neurotoxicity or leukoencephalopathy. Other neurodegenerative disorders, including severe MTHFR deficiency, idiopathic cerebral folate deficiency, and a few cases of Rett syndrome have also been associated with low 5-MTHF levels or elevated homocysteine levels in the CSF. Regardless of etiology, disruption of folate metabolism in the CNS may cause acute or chronic neurological manifestations.<SEP>Functional polymorphisms in folate pathway genes may lead to biochemical alterations such as reduced folate levels and elevated homocysteine levels. The following are among the folate pathway genes with functional polymorphisms: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR 677C>T (rs1801133) and MTHFR 1298A>C (rs1801131)], serine hydroxymethyltransferase [SHMT 1420C>T (rs1979277)], methionine synthase [MS 2756A>G (rs1805087)], methionine synthase reductase [MTRR 66A>G (rs1801394)], and thymidylate synthase in the form of enhancer region repeats (TSER). Since folate is critical for CNS development and function, we hypothesized that the presence of certain folate pathway polymorphisms, previously associated with reduced folate or elevated homocysteine, would be related to neurocognitive deficits after MTX chemotherapy for treatment of ALL. Folate pathway polymorphisms included in the study were selected based on evidence in the literature for functionality of the polymorphisms and a minor allele frequency >5%.<SEP>We previously reported that impairment on a brief neurocognitive screen predicted impairment in global intellectual function, reading skills, and mathematical skills in childhood cancer survivors ≥ 6 years old. The screen consisted of a parental questionnaire and standardized clinical performance-based measures, including: Trail Making Test Parts A (TMTA) and B (TMTB) for assessment of attention and processing speed, Grooved Pegboard Test Dominant-Hand (PEGDH) and Nondominant-Hand (PEGNDH) for evaluation of fine motor speed, Digit Span (DIG) for assessment of working memory, and Verbal Fluency Test (CFL) for evaluation of executive function. Impairment on the screen, hereafter referred to as the DIVERGT battery, predicted impaired global intellect (p<0.0001). The battery had a sensitivity and specificity for impaired global intellect of 94% and 63% respectively, and it also predicted impairment in reading (p<0.03) and mathematics (p<0.03).<SEP>Krull et al previously reported that ALL survivors with MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes had a 7.4-fold increased risk of developing attention deficit disorder, as measured by a parental questionnaire. The MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism alone was not related to deficits in attention. In the current study, we expanded the panel of folate pathway polymorphisms and evaluated multiple neurocognitive domains, including attention, using the direct child performance measures in the DIVERGT battery. The objective of this study was to further explore whether interindividual variation in folate metabolism influences susceptibility to global neurocognitive impairment and domain-specific impairment in attention, processing speed, and memory after ALL therapy, using direct measures of performance.","Methods<SEP>Subjects<SEP>Since 2003, long-term survivors at Texas Children's Hospital have been prospectively enrolled on a study protocol to correlate genetic polymorphisms and therapy-related toxicity, including neurocognitive impairment as determined by clinical chart review. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at Baylor College of Medicine, and survivors (if ≥18 years old) or their parents provided informed consent for the study. The recruitment rate is 95%, and participants provide a peripheral blood sample for DNA extraction. As part of routine clinical care, ALL survivors at Texas Children's Hospital are referred for the DIVERGT battery. We identified 72 survivors of B-precursor and T-cell ALL, treated with chemotherapy alone and consecutively enrolled on the above protocol, who had completed the battery and who met eligibility criteria for the current study. Inclusion criteria included age at ALL diagnosis of ≥1 year and ≤18 years. Exclusion criteria included history of CNS leukemia, cranial irradiation, prior head injury, underlying genetic or neurological disorder associated with neurocognitive impairment, neurodevelopmental disorder associated with folate metabolism (e.g. spina bifida), or pre-existing neurocognitive disorder. Medical charts were abstracted for age at diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, leukemia subtype, past medical history, occurrence of early MTX-related neurotoxicity (as defined by acute or subacute onset of seizures, mental status changes, neurologic deficits, or stroke-like encephalopathy), body surface area at diagnosis, number of intrathecal MTX doses, and cumulative intravenous (IV) MTX exposure in g/m2 of body surface area.<SEP>Neurocognitive Evaluation<SEP>The DIVERGT battery was conducted prior to genotyping by a trained examiner under the supervision of a neuropsychologist. The tests are age-referenced and nationally standardized to a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The definition of impairment on the battery has been previously described. Additionally, performance on each of the six measures was evaluated as a continuous variable. A dichotomous variable for domain-specific impairment was also determined for each child performance measure, defined as a score <80 on the individual measure (<10th percentile).<SEP>Genotype Analysis<SEP>Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using commercially preformulated TaqMan genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used to genotype the MTHFR 677C>T (Assay ID C_1202883), MTHFR 1298A>C (C_850486_20), MS 2756A>G (C_12005959_10), and MTRR 66A>G (C_3068176_10) polymorphisms. The 25 μL reaction mixture included 20 ng genomic DNA, 12.5 μL of 2× TaqMan universal PCR master mix, 1.25 μL of the respective 20× SNP genotyping assay mix, and DNase-free water. The allelic discrimination PCRs were conducted on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System using the following conditions: 95°C for 10 minutes and then 35 cycles of: 1) 92°C for 15 seconds and 2) 60°C for 1 minute. For SHMT 1420 C>T genotyping, allelic discrimination PCR was conducted similarly using custom-made primers (forward: 5′-CTC CGG GAG GAG GTT GAG A-3′; reverse: 5′-GCC CGC TCC TTT AGA AGT CA-3′) and probes (Allele C sequence: 5′-VIC- CTT CGC CTC TCT CTT C-MGB-3′; Allele T sequence: 5′-FAM-TCG CCT CTT TCT TC-MGB-3′). The 25 μL reaction mixture consisted of: 900 nM each primer, 200 nM each probe, 12.5 μL of 2× TaqMan universal PCR master mix, 20 ng genomic DNA, and DNase-free water. Cycling conditions consisted of 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 10 minutes, and 50 cycles of: 1) 92°C for 30 seconds and 2) 62°C for 1 minute.<SEP>The TSER polymorphism was evaluated using the standard PCR method described by Hishida et al with modifications. Briefly, 30 ng of genomic DNA were used in a 50 μL reaction mixture with 0.15 μM dNTPs, 25 pmol each of forward (5′ – CGT GGC TCC TGC GTT TCC – 3′) and reverse (5′ – GAG CCG GCC ACA GGC AT -3′) primers, 5 μL glycerol, 5 μL Magnesium-free 10× PCR buffer, and 1.5 mM MgCl2. 0.4 units of Taq polymerase were added to the reaction mixture after a hot-start. Amplification conditions consisted of a 95° denaturation cycle for 10 minutes; 35 cycles of: 1) 95°C for 30 seconds, 2) 61°C for 30 seconds, and 3) 72°C for 30 seconds; and a 72°C final extension cycle for 5 minutes. TSER genotypes were ascertained on a 4% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. The 2R/2R genotype was represented by a single 210-bp band, 2R/3R genotype produced 210-bp and 238-bp fragments, and 3R/3R homozygotes had a single 238-bp band. For quality control, 10% of samples were randomly selected for duplicate genotyping for each polymorphism, showing 100% concordance.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>For each polymorphism, the genotype related to reduced folate or elevated homocysteine levels in the literature was hypothesized to be the at-risk genotype for neurocognitive dysfunction. Using a dominant model to define exposure, the following were hypothesized to be at-risk genotypes: MTHFR 677CT/TT, MTHFR 1298AC/CC, SHMT 1420CC, MS 2756AA, MTRR 66AA, and TSER 2R/3R or 3R/3R. Outcome measures included impairment on the DIVERGT battery, standard scores on each of the six child performance measures, and domain-specific impairment on each of the six child performance measures. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize study variables. One sample t-test was used to compare the mean score in the study population for each child performance measure to the expected mean of 100. For univariate analyses, Fisher exact test (categorical variables) and Student's two sample t-test (continuous variables) were used to compare outcomes according to genotype. Potential covariates included age at diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, leukemia subtype, number of intrathecal MTX doses, and cumulative IV MTX exposure. High-dose and intermediate-dose IV MTX were included in the computation of cumulative IV MTX exposure. Using median values, dichotomous variables were created for age at diagnosis, number of intrathecal MTX doses, and cumulative IV MTX exposure. Multivariable analyses were performed with logistic regression and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). All analyses were performed with Stata 10 (Statacorp LP, College Station, TX). A 2-sided p-value of <0.05 was considered significant.<SEP>For each participant, we scored the number of adverse alleles (0 to 2) for each polymorphism and then calculated a composite folate pathway genetic risk score (GRS) by summing the number of adverse alleles across the six polymorphisms. The median GRS was used to separate the study population into a high-GRS group (more hypothesized adverse alleles) and low-GRS group (fewer hypothesized adverse alleles). Exploratory analyses were conducted using the methods described above to investigate the relationships between GRS and the primary outcomes.","Results<SEP>Study Population<SEP>The study population had a male predominance (M:F ratio 2:1) that was slightly higher than expected, but it was otherwise representative of the ALL population seen at Texas Children's Hospital (Table I). Study participants were diagnosed between 1987 and 2001 and treated on various protocols, primarily Pediatric Oncology Group protocols (including POG 9005, POG 9006, POG 9405, POG 9605, POG 8698, and POG 8699). Early MTX-related neurotoxicity occurred in 7 patients (9.7%). Impairment on the DIVERGT battery was observed in 44.3% of the study population. Mean neurocognitive test scores in the overall population demonstrated mild deficits on PEGDH (p=0.02), PEGNDH (p<0.001) and CFL (p<0.001), when compared to the expected means of 100 (Table II). All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.<SEP>Genotype and Impairment on the DIVERGT Battery<SEP>Impairment on the battery was related to two polymorphisms: MTHFR 1298A>C (p=0.03) and MS 2756A>G (p=0.05). Survivors with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes had a 3.0-fold increased risk of impairment (95% CI 1.1-8.1), compared to those with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype. Similarly, those with the MS 2756 AA genotype were 3.8 times as likely to meet criteria for impairment on the battery as those with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes. MTHFR 677C>T, SHMT 1520C>T, MTRR 66A>G, and TSER polymorphisms were not significantly related to general impairment on the DIVERGT battery.<SEP>Genotype and Individual Child Performance Measures<SEP>Several genotypes were related to performance on TMTA (focused attention, processing speed) and TMTB (shifting attention, processing speed), as shown in Table III. Survivors with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes performed on average 7 points lower on TMTA (p=0.11) and 13 points lower on TMTB (p=0.001), compared to those with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype. Survivors with the MS 2756AA genotype scored on average 12.2 points lower on TMTA (p=0.01) and 5.3 points lower on TMTB (p=0.23), compared to survivors with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes. Finally, survivors with TSER 2R/3R and 3R/3R genotypes scored on average 10 points lower on TMTA (p=0.07) and 11.4 points lower on TMTB (p=0.03) than those with the TSER 2R/2R genotype. MTHFR 677C>T, SHMT 1420C>T, and MTRR 66A>G polymorphisms were not associated with performance on TMTA or TMTB. Complete analyses by genotypes for all six performance measures can be found in Supplemental Table I.<SEP>The remaining neurocognitive tests assessed fine motor skills (PEGDH and PEGNDH), working memory (DIG), and executive function (CFL). For survivors with the MS 2756AA genotype, the mean PEGNDH score was 11.7 points lower than that of individuals with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes (p=0.02). Additionally, survivors with the MTRR 66AA genotype scored on average 10.7 points lower on PEGNDH than those with the MTRR 66AG/GG genotypes (p=0.05). Survivors with the MTRR 66AA genotype also scored 10.5 points lower on average on CFL, compared with survivors with the MTRR 66AG/GG genotypes (p=0.01). Performance on the PEGDH and DIG measures were not associated with any genotype.<SEP>We did not observe an association between any child performance measure and any of the following covariates: sex, ethnicity/race, age at diagnosis, leukemia subtype, number of intrathecal MTX doses, and cumulative IV MTX exposure. The associations between genotype and child performance measures that are described above did not change after adjustment for these covariates. Of the 7 survivors with a history of early MTX-related neurotoxicity, 6 (85%) met criteria for long-term neurocognitive impairment on the DIVERGT battery. While early MTX-related neurotoxicity was predictive of long-term neurocognitive impairment (p=0.03), 25 of 63 survivors (40%) without early MTX-related neurotoxicity also went on to develop long-term neurocognitive impairment as determined by the DIVERGT battery. The 7 survivors with a history of early MTX-related neurotoxicity scored on average 15.3 points lower on TMTB than survivors without early neurotoxicity (p=0.03). Early MTX-related neurotoxicity was not predictive of impairment on TMTA, PEGDH, PEGNDH, DIG, or CFL.<SEP>Complete genotyping results for all six polymorphisms were available for computation of the GRS in 59 patients. In this group, the GRS ranged from 0 to 9, with a mean of 6.2 and a median of 6. On average, survivors with a GRS ≥ 6 scored 9.5 points lower on TMTA (p=0.06) and 14.5 points lower on TMTB (p=0.002) than survivors with a GRS < 6 (Table III). No difference was observed in mean scores on PEGDH, PEGNDH, or DIG between the GRS groups. The association between the GRS and TMTB performance remained significant after adjustment for sex, age at diagnosis, intrathecal MTX exposure, and cumulative IV MTX exposure. We did not observe an association between GRS and impairment on the DIVERGT battery. However, all of the patients who demonstrated impaired performance on TMTA or TMTB (score <80) had GRS ≥ 6. No association was observed between GRS and impairment on PEGDH, PEGNDH, DIG, or CFL.","Discussion<SEP>This study investigated the association between six folate pathway polymorphisms and neurocognitive deficits in childhood ALL survivors, with the premise that these polymorphisms would modulate neurocognitive function in the setting of intermittent folate depletion due to MTX. In a previous study of 48 childhood ALL survivors, Krull et al reported a 7.4-fold increased risk of attention deficit disorder, as measured by parental questionnaire, in survivors with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotype. Results of the current study, which includes 24 additional survivors and new independent measures that evaluate child performance directly rather than through a proxy rater, corroborate this earlier finding. Specifically, patients with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes had lower mean scores for direct performance measures of shifting attention and processing speed, namely TMTB. Additionally, the current study provides a more comprehensive investigation of the role of folate pathway polymorphisms in the development of neurocognitive deficits after ALL therapy. We genotyped a total of six folate pathway polymorphisms in the current study, and our findings suggest that MS 2756A>G and TSER polymorphisms may also contribute to the interindividual variation in neurocognitive function seen in ALL survivors. The combined effect of multiple polymorphisms on the folate pathway, as measured by the GRS, may be more important than one single polymorphism.<SEP>The MTHFR, MS, and TS genes have key functions in the regulation of folate and homocysteine. The MTHFR enzyme catalyzes the reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-MTHF, and the MTHFR 1298CC genotype results in 60% of the usual MTHFR enzyme activity. MS catalyzes the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine with methylcobalamin as a cofactor, and MS deficiency results in elevated plasma homocysteine levels. The MS 2756A>G polymorphism leads to an amino acid substitution, and the variant G allele has been associated with lower plasma homocysteine levels, possibly conferring a protective effect. Finally, TS catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate to deoxythymidine monophosphate. The promoter enhancer region of the TS gene may contain two (2R) or three (3R) 28-bp tandem repeat sequences that function as transcriptional enhancer elements. The TSER 3R/3R genotype yields higher gene expression levels in vitro and higher enzyme activity in vivo than the 2R/2R genotype. The 3R/3R genotype is associated with reduced folate and higher homocysteine levels, particularly in individuals with low dietary folate intake.<SEP>While the MTHFR 1298A>C, MS 2756A>G, and TSER polymorphisms do not directly lead to neurodegenerative disease in normal individuals, they may become critical in the setting of intermittently exaggerated folate depletion caused by MTX therapy for childhood ALL. Alternatively, it is possible that these polymorphisms are not directly associated with neurocognitive dysfunction but are surrogate markers for tightly linked polymorphisms that are in fact responsible for the associations seen in our study. MTHFR 1298A>C and MS 2756A>G were associated with impairment on the DIVERGT battery, suggesting an impact on global intellectual function. MTHFR 1298A>C, MS 2756A>G, and TSER polymorphisms also appeared to be related specifically to deficits in attention and processing speed, as indicated by TMTA and TMTB. In a study of ALL patients that included patients with cranial irradiation, Krajinovic et al found that polymorphisms in MTHFR 677C>T, MTHFR 1298A>C, MS 2756A>G, and MTRR 66A>G were not related to change in IQ scores over the first four years after diagnosis of ALL. These patients were diagnosed in a similar treatment era as patients on our study but had differences in CNS-directed therapy and did not have long-term neurocognitive evaluations that allow comparison to our study.<SEP>The combined effect of multiple folate pathway polymorphisms may best predict which children are at risk for treatment-related neurocognitive deficits. Survivors with GRS ≥ 6 performed consistently worse on measures of attention and processing speed and were more likely to demonstrate clinical impairment in these domains. An individual with several at-risk genotypes may have striking variation in folate or homocysteine levels that leads to increased risk for neurocognitive deficits after MTX therapy. As the effects of additional folate pathway polymorphisms are evaluated in a larger sample size, the GRS may be refined to provide a more accurate prediction of which children are at risk for treatment-related toxicity.<SEP>Mean scores for TMTA, TMTB, and DIG in our study population were similar to population norms. However, the lack of baseline neurocognitive testing makes it impossible to evaluate whether declines occurred in these domains over time for individual patients. ALL survivors overall scored lower on tests of fine motor speed than expected for age-adjusted population norms. Similar findings have been reported in other studies and have been postulated to be related to vincristine chemotherapy. Decreased verbal fluency performance has also been previously reported in childhood ALL survivors and do not appear to be related to demographic or treatment variables.<SEP>One of the strengths of our study was that the study population was drawn from long-term survivors, with median time off-therapy of 4.4 years, ensuring that ample time had elapsed for determination of neurocognitive dysfunction. Additionally, the potential for selection bias is decreased with the use of a validated neurocognitive screening battery, which can be administered in a time-efficient manner during the survivor's annual clinic visit, thereby promoting testing for all ALL survivors.<SEP>This study had several important limitations. The study was adequately powered to detect a statistically significant difference on neurocognitive tests of one standard deviation or greater. However, small differences between genotype groups may not have been detected, and we are unable to investigate potential gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. Validation of these results is clearly needed in a larger study. Additionally, the leukemia protocols used to treat participants in this study were heterogeneous and involved some differences in chemotherapy regimens for CNS prophylaxis. These differences between regimens are partially accounted for by inclusion of the important covariates of cumulative IV MTX dose and number of intrathecal MTX doses. We were unable to analyze the dosing schedule of MTX or leucovorin rescue in the current pilot study. Other limitations included a lack of information in this retrospective study on parental education, socioeconomic status, or dietary folate intake, all of which would be important to include in a future study.<SEP>Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the association between MTX dose intensity and long-term neurocognitive impairment. In a study of 79 survivors of high-risk ALL, neurocognitive performance did not vary between children treated with high-dose MTX and children treated with very high-dose MTX. However, in another study of 36 survivors, those who had received intensified treatment that included high-dose MTX were more likely to have attention deficits than survivors who had received intermediate-dose IV MTX on standard regimens. In our study, we did not observe a relationship between cumulative IV MTX dose or number of intrathecal MTX doses and performance on any of the neurocognitive tests. The study was not designed to investigate this association, so sample size may have been inadequate to detect small differences in test scores among treatment groups. It is also possible, however, that MTX “exposure” from an administered dose, as well as the downstream effects on the folate pathway and neurodevelopment, are moderated by genetic polymorphisms involving folate pathway enzymes. Possible interaction between genotype and MTX exposure will be important to investigate in a larger future study.<SEP>Early MTX-related neurotoxicity may predict long-term neurocognitive impairment, but many patients without a history of early MTX-related neurotoxicity also demonstrated long-term neurocognitive deficits. Although this study was not designed to detect an association between the rare outcome of early MTX-related neurotoxicity and folate pathway polymorphisms, further studies may investigate this relationship. Further investigation is also needed to evaluate the association between folate pathway polymorphisms and neurocognitive function in healthy populations. The MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism, frequently in the setting of hyperhomocysteinemia, has been associated with vascular dementia, cognitive decline with aging, depression, and schizophrenia in non-cancer populations. In a recent study of healthy adolescents, the MTHFR 677TT genotype was associated with a mild reduction in cognitive performance when compared to those with the MTHFR 677CC/CT genotypes. Further evaluation of the other folate pathway polymorphisms and neurocognitive outcomes in the general population may help clarify the impact of MTX therapy and possible gene-environment interactions.<SEP>In summary, we present additional evidence that folate pathway polymorphisms may modulate the development of neurocognitive deficits in childhood ALL survivors. Future directions include validation of these findings in a larger sample of research subjects and investigation of variation in other folate pathway genes, including cystathione beta synthase, reduced folate carrier 1, and dihydrofolate reductase. Additional pathways that may be important to investigate include other drug metabolism pathways, oxidative stress pathways, and glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathways. Results from these studies may allow us to identify ALL patients at highest risk for neurocognitive impairment and therefore develop interventions to prevent this important late effect of therapy.",27272,"['OBWCCE', 'VITMIN']"
21779873,"Introduction<SEP>The first published genome-wide association study for type 2 diabetes showed the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs13266634 in SLC30A8 (OR 1.26, p=5.0×10−7) to be a diabetes-associated locus. SLC30A8 encodes zinc transporter 8 (ZnT-8), a 369 amino acid transmembrane zinc transporter protein produced at high levels only in the pancreas. Within the pancreatic beta cell, zinc is a necessary component for the formation of insulin granules as it provides the nucleus for crystallisation of insulin proteins within secretory vesicles. The SLC30A8 non-synonymous SNP (C to T) results in a missense R325W substitution. The production pattern and putative function of ZnT-8 suggest that it may increase diabetes risk by impairing insulin secretion. Indeed a defect in first-phase insulin secretion was observed in homozygotes for the high-risk C allele in response to intravenous glucose tolerance test (19% decrease in first-phase insulin release, p=0.007), but not during an OGTT. However, homology-based structural modelling of ZnT-8 does not indicate an obvious conformational defect in the docking or transporter segments of the protein. In a recently reported beta cell-specific knockout of Slc30a8 in mice, the defect in first-phase insulin secretion was repeated, and glucose intolerance and elevated proinsulin levels were demonstrated. A study of overweight non-diabetic men from a Finnish cohort (30% of whom had impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) found that individuals with the high-risk genotype at SLC30A8 showed elevated proinsulin/insulin ratios while fasting as well as during OGTT.<SEP>These studies suggest that SLC30A8 variants link to diabetes risk through alterations in proinsulin to insulin conversion. Previous studies have shown that elevated fasting proinsulin levels are associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes independently of insulin levels. However, elevated proinsulin levels in carriers of the SLC30A8 risk genotype may be an epiphenomenon of increased beta cell stress (from insulin resistance or beta cell death), rather than reflecting a specific deficit in polypeptide processing. Such non-specific mechanisms cannot be ruled out as mediators of the SLC30A8-associated increase in diabetes susceptibility. We reasoned that if SLC30A8-associated proinsulin elevations were largely mediated by a proinsulin-to-insulin conversion defect, interventions that decreased insulin resistance should lower proinsulin in high- and low-risk genotype groups to equal degrees. However, if increased beta cell stress (i.e. increased insulin resistance) was the major determinant of SLC30A8-associated proinsulin levels, interventions that ameliorate insulin resistance should show a selectively beneficial effect in carriers of the SLC30A8 risk genotype as compared with the protective genotype.<SEP>In the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), we have previously shown that genotype at SLC30A8 rs13266634 is not associated with diabetes incidence, with no significant interaction of genotype with intervention being observed with regard to this outcome. To assess the putative association of SLC30A8 with proinsulin levels and their response to treatments designed to lower insulin resistance, we examined the effect of SLC30A8 genotype on proinsulin levels in the DPP at baseline and 1 year after preventive interventions.","Methods<SEP>The DPP (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00004992; for a list of investigators see electronic supplementary material [ESM]) enrolled 3,234 US American participants at high risk of developing diabetes (on the basis of overweight, increased fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance) and randomised them to placebo, metformin 850 mg twice daily or a lifestyle intervention aimed at ≥7% weight loss and ≥150 min of physical activity per week. A fourth arm of 585 participants who were initially randomised to troglitazone was terminated early because of concerns with hepatotoxicity. Of the above, 3,007 participants who had consented to genetic investigation and for whom valid SLC30A8 genotypes and data at 1 year were available were studied here.<SEP>The main endpoint was development of diabetes (as indicated by fasting glucose or 2 h glucose after an OGTT) confirmed by a second measurement. In total, 551 participants developed diabetes; the DPP showed that participants treated with metformin or with a lifestyle intervention were respectively 31% or 58% less likely to develop diabetes after an average of 3.2 years of follow-up. To assess the effects of genotype at SLC30A8 rs13266634 on proinsulin levels in the DPP cohort, we analysed participants at baseline using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with proinsulin as the dependent variable, and fasting insulin, age, sex, self-reported ethnicity and genotype at SLC30A8 rs13266634 (obtained from our prior study as previously described) as independent variables.<SEP>To evaluate the effect of genotype at SLC30A8 rs13266634 on treatment-mediated reductions in proinsulin after 1 year of DPP interventions, we performed a prospective cohort analysis using ANCOVA models with fasting proinsulin at baseline and year 1 as the dependent variables. Participants who developed diabetes at 1 year were excluded from year 1 analyses. Nominal two-sided p values adjusted for multiple comparisons are reported for post-hoc active treatment vs placebo statistical tests. All models included age, sex, self-reported ethnicity and genotype at SLC30A8 rs13266634 as independent variables. Mixed models ANCOVAwas used to assess the effect of DPP treatments and genotype at SLC30A8 on proinsulin levels independently of insulin levels; the baseline proinsulin model was additionally adjusted for baseline fasting insulin; the year 1 proinsulin model was adjusted for year 1 fasting insulin. Additional adjustment of the year 1 model for baseline fasting proinsulin and insulin was performed to model change after controlling for the main effect of this SNP on proinsulin. Genotype × treatment interaction tests were performed for all year 1 models with the intention of analysing treatment groups together if there were no significant genotype × treatment interactions.","Results<SEP>At baseline, the C risk allele at SLC30A8 rs13266634 was significantly associated with higher fasting proinsulin levels in the DPP cohort. This association was in an allele dose-dependent fashion after adjustment for baseline fasting insulin (p=0.002; Table 1) and remained statistically significant after further adjustment for fasting glucose (p=0.001; Table 1).<SEP>After 1 year of randomised DPP intervention, fasting proinsulin levels were significantly decreased (p<0.001) in all active intervention groups compared with placebo, even after adjustment for 1 year fasting insulin, age, sex and ethnicity (Fig. 1). While intervention groups had significantly lower proinsulin levels than placebo group at 1 year, the lifestyle intervention group had the largest decrease and was significantly lower than the metformin (p<0.001) or troglitazone (p=0.002) groups. The metformin and troglitazone intervention groups had similar proinsulin levels at 1 year (p=0.86). There was no genotype × treatment interaction (p=0.78), suggesting that the dosage of SLC30A8 risk alleles did not modify the effectiveness of any treatment. As there were no significant genotype × treatment interactions, the four groups were also analysed together. At 1 year after DPP interventions, fasting proinsulin levels were no longer associated significantly with genotype at the SLC30A8 locus when adjusted for 1 year fasting insulin, age, sex and ethnicity (p=0.86; Table 1).","Discussion<SEP>Our results demonstrate that genotype at SLC30A8 was associated with fasting proinsulin levels at baseline in the prediabetic DPP cohort; proinsulin levels were positively correlated with dosage of the C diabetes risk allele. These findings are consistent with a previous study demonstrating elevated fasting proinsulin levels in Finnish individuals with IGT. Because fasting proinsulin in our study was adjusted for fasting insulin, this trait represents an elevation of proinsulin that is out of proportion to the hyper-insulinaemia induced by insulin resistance. The persistence of this finding after adjustment for fasting glucose suggests that the effect of genotype on proinsulin is not mediated by ambient glycaemia and its impact on beta cells.<SEP>After 1 year of DPP treatments, all of which provided an insulin-sensitising effect, proinsulin levels fell in all treatment groups compared with placebo. This decrease in proinsulin levels remained significant after adjustment for 1 year fasting insulin, suggesting that the decrease in proinsulin levels did not simply reflect a fall in insulin. This indicates that the notable amelioration in insulin sensitivity also signals improved beta cell function.<SEP>Genotype at SLC30A8 rs13266634 was no longer associated with proinsulin levels in the DPP cohort after 1 year of treatment. This was true for the placebo as well as the active intervention groups. We also note that genotype at SLC30A8 rs13266634 was no longer associated with proinsulin levels at 1 year even in a model unadjusted for baseline proinsulin levels (data not shown). This lack of association could be due to a loss of power to detect proinsulin differences by genotype when the cohort was divided into intervention groups. But these data are also consistent with the postulate that the various insulin-sensitising interventions leading to lower proinsulin levels could have been potent enough to decrease the main effect of SLC30A8 rs13266634 genotype on proinsulin.<SEP>Since elevated proinsulin levels are an independent risk factor for the eventual development of type 2 diabetes, our data suggest that susceptibility to diabetes posed by high-risk alleles at the SLC30A8 locus could be attenuated by preventive treatment prior to the development of diabetes. In the case of the SLC30A8 locus, interventions such as lifestyle could be targeted even before elevated proinsulin levels or IGT manifest in carriers of the risk genotypes.",10172,['OBWCCE']
25060692,"1. Introduction<SEP>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) currently affects about one-third of the population in Western countries and is an emerging public health problem worldwide. Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), also known as adiponutrin, first came to wide attention with regard to NAFLD when Romeo et al. reported a strong association between the PNPLA3 polymorphism rs738409 C/G (I148M) and NAFLD. This association has been confirmed in a number of independent studies of fatty liver disease.<SEP>The regulation and function of PNPLA3 are still unclear. It was reported that PNPLA3 has both TG hydrolase and transacylase activity in vitro. He et al. demonstrated that the wild type PNPLA3 enzyme has TG hydrolase activity in vitro assays and that overexpression of PNPLA3-I148M increased the TG content of cultured Huh7 liver cells and mouse liver in vivo. Moreover, Huang et al. showed that wild type PNPLA3 has a high hydrolytic activity for glycerolipids and that the I148M substitution dramatically decreased its enzymatic activity. Thus, these studies support that PNPLA3 is involved in lipid metabolism by functioning as a TG hydrolase. However, Qiao et al. showed that overexpression of PNPLA3 increased TG content in primary mouse hepatocytes, suggesting that PNPLA3 is lipogenic. Consistent with this study, Kumari et al. reported that PNPLA3 functions as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acyltransferase, which catalyzes the conversion of LPA into phosphatidic acid (PA) for phospholipid synthesis. Kumari et al. concluded that the I148M variant of PNPLA3 is involved in development of NAFLD by a gain of lipogenic function. In addition, Kumashiro et al. recently demonstrated that knockdown of PNPLA3 with specific antisense oligonucleotides prevented hepatic steatosis in high fat fed rats and reduced PA and the ratio of PA to LPA. However, two other studies failed to identify any metabolic changes including TG metabolism in PNPLA3 null mice, suggesting that PNPLA3 is not a major player in glucose/lipid metabolism or that other compensatory factors are activated in response to the loss of PNPLA3. Recently, it has been proposed that PNPLA3 plays roles in discriminating fatty acids and remodeling lipid droplets. Overall, the role of PNPLA3 in the pathogenesis of NAFLD appears to be complex, and remains an open question.<SEP>In the present study, we focused on the regulation of PNPLA3 expression by addressing three questions: Does the intake of a high-carbohydrate (HC) diet or a high-fat (HF) diet upregulate the expression of PNPLA3 in the mouse liver? Does inclusion of fat in the HC diet aggravate or attenuate the effect of the HC diet? Does glucose have a direct effect on PNPLA3 expression in human HepG2 cells as a hepatocyte model? Our data indicate that while both our HC and HF diets result in increased liver lipids, only the HC diet increased PNPLA3 gene expression. This effect was reduced by inclusion of fat in the HC diet or by addition of fatty acids to high glucose-treated HepG2 cells. Together our results show that PNPLA3 expression is tightly controlled by glucose and certain types of unsaturated fatty acids, and suggests that PNPLA3 likely reflects lipogenesis in the liver. However it is not necessarily associated with the development of steatosis.","2. Materials and Methods<SEP>2.1. Animals and dietary protocols<SEP>Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of Pennsylvania State University. To evaluate hepatic PNPLA3 expression in response to diet, two studies were conducted. In study 1, the diet was based on a liquid formula (Clinimix E®, Baxter, Abbott, Deerfield, IL) that was supplemented with vitamins (Pediatric Influvite®, Baxter, Abbott, Deerfield, IL) and minerals and trace elements (8 μg/L zinc chloride, 6.4 μg/L cupric sulfate, 1.2 μg/L manganous sulfate, 80 μg/L chromium chloride, 176 μg/L sodium selenite, and 1.13 g/L ferrous sulfate); this HC diet has been shown to induce hepatic steatosis in 4–5 weeks. In study 1, twenty 5-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were housed on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle and randomized into 4 groups which received either: 1) a regular rodent diet (normal chow, rodent diet 5001 containing 58% carbohydrate, 13.5% fat, and 28.5% protein. (The composition of all experimental diets is expressed in % energy.) 2) HC liquid diet containing 76.8% carbohydrate in the form of dextrose, 22.7% protein, and 0.5% fat, an amount which was added in the form of lipid emulsion (LE) (Intralipid 20%, Baxter, Abbott, Deerfield, IL), as a source of essential fatty acids; 3) the same formula with 4% LE (74% carbohydrate, 22% protein, and 4.0% fat), referred to as HC-4% LE; or 4) the same formula supplemented with 13.5% LE (66.8% carbohydrate, 19.7% protein, and 13.5% fat), referred to as HC-13.5% LE. For all mice fed liquid diets, a known volume of the appropriate diet was added daily to a feeding tube and the amount remaining the next day was determined to calculate total intake. The liquid diet was the only source of nutrition and hydration. In study 2, liver tissue was obtained from a study of high fat (HF) diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed purified diets (Research Diet, Inc, New Brunswick, NJ) for 16 weeks which was either low fat (LF) (70% carbohydrate, 10% fat, and 20% protein); a HF diet (25% carbohydrate, 60% fat, and 15% protein) or they were treated with the same HF diet but allowed to voluntarily exercise through access to running wheels, see for details. Mice in study 2 were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and drinking water. Body weights (study 1 and 2) and liver TG levels (study 1) of mice have been published. Briefly, final body weight among different groups were same in study 1, and exercise resulted in decreased final body weight (12%) compared to HF-fed mice.<SEP>At the end of each study (5 wk for study 1 and 16 wk for study 2), mice were either euthanized with carbon dioxide (study 1) or anesthetized and killed by exsanguination (study 2) and tissues were dissected. In study 1, portions of the left liver lobes were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance CA). In both experiments liver samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C before use. All other tissues were stored at −80°C.<SEP>2.2. Cell culture and Oil Red O staining<SEP>To investigate whether glucose, fatty acids and other supplements affect PNPLA3 expression in liver cells, HepG2 cells were used. These human hepatocarcinoma cells represent a relatively well-differentiated cell model of hepatocyte function and possess a wide variety of liver-specific metabolic functions. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 0.5% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO2-air incubator. Cells were at approximately 80% confluence at the time of treatment.<SEP>For detection of lipid accumulation by Oil Red O staining, HepG2 cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for 1 hour. Then cells were washed with 60% isopropanol after fixation with formalin and incubated with Oil Red O working solution for 10 minutes. Cells were washed with warm tap water for 4 times. After photography, the dye was eluted by adding a precise volume of 100% isopropanol and the optical density at 510 nm was measured to quantify total lipid staining.<SEP>2.3 Liver TG quantification<SEP>Liver total lipid was extracted from 200 mg of fresh liver according to the method of Folch et al.. Then liver TG was assayed by a modification of the method of Sardesi and Manning. Briefly, the total lipid extract from liver was applied to a column of 5% water-deactivated aluminum and the TG fraction was eluted with 25% diethyl ether in hexane. Then the TG content in aliquots of the elute was determined spectrophotometrically.<SEP>2.4. Preparation of BSA-bound fatty acids<SEP>Albumin-bound fatty acids were prepared according to methods described elsewhere. Briefly, 0.1mM each fatty acid (oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid) was dissolved in 800 μL ethanol before adding 40 μL of 5 M NaOH. The ethanol was evaporated and 4 ml of pre-warmed sterile phosphate-buffered saline was added to suspend the sodium salts of fatty acids. Five ml of ice -cold BSA solution was added to final concentration of BSA-bound fatty acid of 10 mM with a molar ration of 5.5:1 (fatty acid: BSA) at pH ≈7.4. Aliquots of the fatty acids stock were covered with nitrogen gas and stored at −20°C.<SEP>2.5. Total RNA extraction and reverse transcription<SEP>Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver and adipose tissue using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA from HepG2 cells was isolated using QIAGEN RNeasy mini kit following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The concentration of total RNA was determined by UV absorbance spectrophotometry (NanoDrop ND-1000). The reverse transcription reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 μl and consisted of 4 μl 5X M-MLV RT Buffer, 250 μM dNTP mix, 50 ng oligo-dT15 primer, 20 U of ribonuclease inhibitor and 200 U of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). The reaction was performed at 42 °C for 30 min, 37 °C for 30 min, and 94 °C for 5 min.<SEP>2.6. Quantitative Real Time PCR<SEP>The iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was used for RT-PCR. The reaction was conducted in a total volume of 20 μl in 96-well plates. The PCR reaction conditions for each cycle were as follows: 94°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec. Each value for the mRNA of analyzed genes was normalized relative to the mRNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or β-actin analyzed on the same plate. The primers were made by the Nucleic Acid Facility, Penn State University, University Park, Gene primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1.<SEP>2.7. Western Blotting<SEP>Whole cell or tissue lysates (30–50 μg protein) were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS–PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The blots were then incubated with anti-PNPLA3 polyclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution; Everest Biotech; EB08402), anti-PNPLA3 (1:2000; abcam, ab81874), anti-ERK2 polyoclonal antibody (1:5000; Santa Cruz; sc-154), and anti-β-actin (1:2000; Santa Cruz; sc-47778). For all blots, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody or IRDye (Li-cor) secondary antibody was used. The protein bands were visualized by ECL Western blotting analysis system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) or Odyssey Imaging System (Li-cor).<SEP>2.8. RNA interference<SEP>PNPLA3 siRNA (Thermo Scientific, Cat# L-009564-02) was delivered into HepG2 cells using Dharma FECT transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific, Cat# T-2004-01) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Non-targeting siRNA (Thermo Scientific, Cat# D-001810-10-05) was used as a negative control.<SEP>2.9. Statistical analysis<SEP>Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean for the number of replicates indicated. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA or Student’s t -test, as appropriate (Prism 5 software, GraphPad). Results from the NC and HC groups were compared only to each other, using Student’s t -test, since these diets are fundamentally different in composition. Results for the same type of diet, e.g., HC diet compared to modified HC diet (+4% LE or +13.5% LE), were analyzed by ANOVA. To establish correlations, Pearson’s regression analysis was performed. A significant difference was defined as P<0.05.","3. Results<SEP>3.1. High carbohydrate diet increases and lipid emulsion attenuates the expression of PNPLA3 in mouse liver<SEP>We first analyzed how a lipogenic diet affects the expression of PNPLA3 in liver of intact mice. Compared to the group fed a stock diet (normal chow, NC), PNPLA3 mRNA was increased 7-fold in the liver of mice fed HC diet (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the inclusion of LE in the HC diet, either as HC-4% LE diet or as HC-13.5% LE diet, prevented the induction of PNPLA3 mRNA dose-dependently (Fig. 1A). Results from western blotting showed that similar changes were evident for PNPLA3 protein (Fig. 1B). Liver total TG content was significantly correlated with PNPLA3 mRNA levels in mice fed HC diet, either with or without LE (Fig. 1C).<SEP>3.2. PNPLA3 is correlated with SREBP1c and ACC-1 in mouse liver<SEP>To determine if a similar pattern existed for other genes that are important in the lipogenic pathway, we also examined expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1c), a key transcriptional factor that regulates many genes involved in lipid metabolism, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-1), which is responsible for formation of malonyl-CoA in the process of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Both SREBP1c (Fig. 2A) and ACC-1 (Fig. 2B) showed a similar expression pattern to that of PNPLA3. We observed a correlation between PNPLA3 mRNA and SREBP1c mRNA (Fig. 2C; R2 =0.62; P<0.0001) and ACC-1 mRNA (Fig. 2D; R2 =0.84; P<0.0001). SREBP1c mRNA was also correlated with ACC-1 mRNA (Fig. 2E; R2 =0.85; P<0.0001). By contrast, PNPLA2 (ATGL), which can break down TG, did not differ among diets (Supplementary Fig. 1A). We also measured PNPLA3 gene expression in mouse epididymal tissue. PNPLA3 was not different among diet groups in this tissue (Supplementary Fig. 1B), although, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1C, PNPLA3 expression is highly expressed in murine adipose tissue.<SEP>3.3. Hepatic PNPLA3 expression is not elevated in the liver of mice fed HF diet but is suppressed by exercise<SEP>Next, we studied how high-fat feeding and physical activity may affect the expression of PNPLA3. In study 2, mice fed HF diet developed fatty liver indicated by the increased level of hepatic TG (Fig. 3A). This increase was attenuated by exercise (Fig. 3A). PNPLA3 expression was not elevated in mice with HF-induced fatty liver, compared to mice fed LF diet (Fig. 3B). Strikingly, voluntary exercise reduced PNPLA3 mRNA levels by 10-fold compared to the LF and HF diet groups (Fig. 3B). The mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Fig. 3C) and SREPB1c (Fig. 3D) did not differ between LF and HF diet groups. By contrast, ACC-1 was lower in the HF compared to the LF diet group (Fig. 3E). Moreover, exercise significantly suppressed both SREBP1c and ACC-1 gene expression (Fig. 3D and E).<SEP>3.4. PNPLA3 gene expression was regulated by glucose in HepG2 cells<SEP>We investigated PNPLA3 and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) gene expression in HepG2 cells exposed to “depletion-re-feeding conditions” in which cells were cycled between no glucose (depletion), low, and high glucose media. PNPLA3 gene expression was reduced after 8 h of depletion (P < 0.05), while the level returned to base line 8 h after high glucose refeeding (Fig. 4A). After this, reduction in glucose resulted in a moderate reduction in expression, while high glucose for 8 to 24 h increased the level of expression, which, subsequently, was again completely abrogated after 16 h of starvation. ChREBP exhibited a similar pattern of expression to that of PNPLA3 (Fig. 4B), and correlation analysis showed that PNPLA3 mRNA levels were highly significantly correlated with ChREBP mRNA levels (Fig. 4C).<SEP>3.5. PNPLA3 gene expression varies in response to glycolytic intermediates in HepG2 cells<SEP>A series of experiments were conducted to determine whether metabolism of glucose was essential for induction of PNPLA3, and whether a specific glycolytic intermediate could be responsible for regulating PNPLA3 expression. These results showed that treatment with the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, did not induce PNPLA3 expression (Fig. 5A). Similarly, SREBP1c gene expression was induced two-fold by high glucose compared to low glucose, but suppressed by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (Fig 5B). Oil Red O staining showed that high glucose resulted in increased lipid accumulation, whereas 2-deoxy-D-glucose led to reduction of lipid content in cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B). Incubation with citrate, a Krebs cycle intermediate downstream of glucose metabolism, increased PNPLA3 levels, whereas pyruvate and acetate were ineffective (Fig. 5C). Expression patterns of FAS and ACC-1 were similar to that of PNPLA3 (Fig. 5D and E). In order to examine the specificity of PNPLA3 to citrate, cells were treated with the isomer isocitrate. The result showed that PNPLA3 was not regulated by isocitrate.<SEP>3.6. PNPLA3 gene does not response to insulin and glucagon in HepG2 cells<SEP>Studies conducted with 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human adipose tissue have shown that PNPLA3 gene expression is regulated by insulin. In addition, one study showed that insulin increased promoter activity of PNPLA3 gene expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Therefore, we examined whether hepatic PNPLA3 is regulated by insulin in HepG2 cells, which express the insulin receptor protein. Incubation of HepG2 cells with 10 nM insulin for 24 h did not increase PNPLA3 mRNA compare to control cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A). By contrast, the same treatment induced the expression of FAS, a known target of insulin action, by 2-fold (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). Taken together, these data suggest that hepatic PNPLA3 does not response to insulin stimulation in HepG2 human hepatocytes. Because our in vivo data showed that exercise suppressed PNPLA3 expression, we hypothesized that exercise may stimulate glucagon secretion, and thereby decrease PNPLA3 gene expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 100 nM glucagon in low (5.5 mM) glucose medium for 24 hours had no effect on PNPLA3 mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. 3C), whereas glucagon stimulated the expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), a known target of glucagon action (Supplementary Fig. 3D).<SEP>3.7. PNPLA3 gene expression is reduced in HepG2 cells by several unsaturated fatty acids<SEP>The major fatty acid components of the LE we employed, Intralipid®, are linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA), and α-linolenic acid (ALA). Since the results of our studies demonstrated that Intralipid completely reversed the induction of PNPLA3 by HC-diet in mouse liver (Fig. 1), we investigated whether certain types of fatty acids affect PNPLA3 gene expression when added directly to HepG2 cells. Interestingly, treatment with either 400 μM OA (Fig. 6A) or LA (Fig. 6B) suppressed PNPLA3 gene expression in both low glucose and high glucose conditions. By contrast, ALA had no effect on PNPLA3 gene expression under either condition (Fig. 6C). We further explored the effects of two long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on PNPLA3 gene expression. Both EPA and DHA suppressed PNPLA3 gene expression under both low and high glucose conditions (Fig. 6D). Moreover, the combination of OA, LA, and ALA (ratio: 6:3:1) significantly suppressed gene expression of PNPLA3 (Fig. 6E), SREBP1c (Fig. 6F), and FAS (Fig. 6G) in both low glucose and high glucose conditions. All of these fatty acids resulted in lipid accumulation as measured by Oil Red O staining (Supplementary Fig. 2A and C).<SEP>3.8. PNPLA3 knockdown did not prevent lipid accumulation but increased FAS expression<SEP>Since PNPLA3 gene expression is regulated by nutritional signals and our data had implicated PNPLA3 as a lipogenic signal, we investigated whether the knockdown of PNPLA3 in HepG2 cells affects glucose or lipid metabolism. Cells transfected with scrambled siRNA as a non-targeting control were compared to cells transfected with PNPLA3-specific siRNA. Transfection with PNPLA3 siRNA decreased PNPLA3 mRNA and protein by ~65% and ~70%, respectively in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7A, B and C). However, Oil Red O staining showed no difference between cells with knocked down PNPLA3 and controls under either low or high glucose conditions (Fig. 7E). PNPLA3 knockdown also had no effect on lipid content when cells were incubated with exogenous fatty acid (OA) (Fig. 7E). Interestingly, we found that FAS mRNA was increased approximately 2 fold in PNPLA3 siRNA-treated cells compared to control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 7D). By contrast, knockdown of FAS using a strategy similar to that used for PNPLA3 had no effect on the level of PNPLA3 expression (data not shown).","4. Discussion<SEP>In the present study, we investigated how dietary changes in carbohydrates and lipids affect PNPLA3 expression in mouse liver and HepG2 cells. The novel results of our in vivo studies include that PNPLA3 gene expression (mRNA) is increased ~7-fold in the liver of mice fed a HC diet with 0.5% fat. However, the addition of fat at either 4 or 13.5 % LE reduced PNPLA3 mRNA dose dependently in the liver of HC-fed mice. In our in vitro studies, we observed that glucose, citrate, and certain types of unsaturated fatty acids also modulated the level of PNPLA3 expression.<SEP>The exact role of PNPLA3 in the development of NAFLD remains poorly understood, although a number of studies have been performed. Our study revealed that PNPLA3 appears to serve as a reliable signal of the liver’s response to a high carbohydrate intake, and can potentially be used as a biomarker for NAFLD caused by carbohydrate overfeeding. In agreement with our finding, a human study showed that the interaction of PNPLA3 genotype and simple carbohydrate intake determines hepatic fat accumulation. The strong association of PNPLA3 with important lipogenic genes, SREBP1c and ACC-1, suggests that these genes are all part of a common program, which likely represents elevated lipogenesis under HC conditions and attenuated lipogenesis when the diet includes an appropriate amount of dietary fat. Our data are consistent with other studies that have shown that PNPLA3 is under the direct control of the transcription factor SREBP1c in response to glucose treatment. By contrast, the expression level of PNPLA2 (also known as adipose triglyceride lipase, ATGL), which shares 70% similarity with PNPLA3, was not changed in HC-fed mice. The lack of regulation of PNPLA2, which is known to be an important TG hydrolase, and the lack of regulation of PNPLA3 in adipose tissue suggests that PNPLA3 in the liver is regulated independently of TG hydrolysis and in a tissue-specific manner. In addition, other studies have shown that nutritional regulation of PNPLA2 is opposite to that of PNPLA3. Notably, the expression pattern of PNPLA3 between human and rodent is different. Our present study showed that hepatic PNPLA3 mRNA is ~ 250-fold lower compared to PNPLA3 expression in adipose tissue. By contrast, human PNPLA3 expression is highest in liver and second highest in skin. The difference of tissue distribution of PNPLA3 between human and rodent are not yet understood. Nevertheless, the results of our studies in human liver cells and in mice in vivo were generally concordant.<SEP>The combined results of study 1 and study 2 strongly suggest that PNPLA3 expression is not responding to increases in body weight, or to accumulating liver fat content. In our HF diet-induced fatty liver model (study 2), we did not observe a significant change of PNPLA3 gene expression due to HF diet. These data indirectly support that the notion that PNPLA3 is related to de novo lipogenesis, since the hepatic steatosis in HF-fed mice is mainly due to overflow of fatty acids coming from lipolysis of adipose tissue and dietary fat, and de novo lipogenesis is less important. Therefore, hepatic steatosis per se does not alter PNPLA3 expression, but lipogenic stimuli do determine the level of hepatic PNPLA3 gene expression. Interestingly, exercise markedly lowered PNPLA3 expression, below that of LF-fed control mice in study 2. Moreover, exercise significantly suppressed both SREBP1c and ACC-1 expression, which indicates that exercise may be a mediator of hepatic lipogenesis. The fact that these genes are regulated in a similar manner by exercise further suggests they are all commonly related to hepatic lipogenesis. While we hypothesized that hormonal changes stimulated by exercise could be responsible for the reduction of PNPLA3, we did not observe any change in PNPLA3 gene expression in HepG2 cells treated directly with either glucagon or insulin. Together, these data suggest that PNPLA3 is positively regulated when there is a surfeit of carbohydrate relative to fat, and it is reduced when metabolism and energy utilization are increased, as in exercise.<SEP>Our studies in HepG2 cells further explored carbohydrate and fatty acids as potential regulators of PNPLA3 expression levels. PNPLA3 gene expression was highly sensitive to glucose concentration, and was rapidly and reversibly regulated under cellular depletion–refeeding conditions. The association of PNPLA3 with ChREBP suggests that this transcription factor may be a critical regulator. In agreement with our data, studies have shown that PNPLA3 is under the direct control of the transcription factor ChREBP in response to glucose treatment. Our studies also reveal that the metabolism of glucose must be crucial, as PNPLA3 was reduced, by addition of 2-deoxy-D-glucose. The metabolic mediators that link glucose metabolism and lipogenic gene transcription have not been identified, but several candidates, such as pyruvate, acetate, and xylulose-5-phosphate, have been proposed as the key signaling compounds. Therefore, we explored the effects of citrate, pyruvate and acetate on PNPLA3 expression. The induction of PNPLA3 by citrate suggests that the oxidation of glucose, which generates adequate oxaloacetic acid for the production of citrate, or direct addition of citrate to cells, is required for the upregulation of PNPLA3 expression in this hepatocyte model.<SEP>The provision of fatty acids reduced PNPLA3 expression, both in vivo in the form of LE and in HepG2 cells in the form of added BSA-bound fatty acid. In HepG2 cells, the reduction in PNPLA3 expression by free fatty acid was observed regardless of glucose concentration, suggesting an independent regulatory effect of fatty acids. Suppression of PNPLA3 by OA or certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic, EPA and DHA, but not ALA) is surprising and unexplained, but interesting. As ALA, EPA and DHA are all n (omega)-3 fatty acids, while LA and OA are n-6 and n-9 fatty acids, respectively, the effect of fatty acid on PNPLA3 expression apparently cannot be attributed to any particular class of unsaturated fatty acid. Other studies have shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit lipogenic genes by reducing SREBP-1c nuclear abundance and inhibiting ChREBP nuclear translocation through transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, including suppression of SREBP-1c gene transcription, enhancement of SREBP1c mRNA decay, and inhibition of ChREBP phosphorylation. Consistent with the above studies, our study revealed that the combination of OA and LA suppressed the main lipogenic genes, SREBP1c and FAS, and also PNPLA3. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism by which fatty acids regulate PNPLA3 expression.<SEP>The knockdown of PNPLA3 did not affect total lipid content when HepG2 cells were incubated in normal medium or treated either with high glucose or OA. Consistent with our study, it has been show that knockdown or overexpression of PNPLA3 in vitro did not change cellular TG content. It is also possible that because our PNPLA3 knockdown resulted in only a 70% reduction in PNPLA3 protein levels, this may not be sufficient to induce a phenotypic change. Alternatively, some compensatory mechanisms could be activated to maintain the homeostasis of glucose and lipid when PNPLA3 expression is reduced. Supporting the latter explanation, we observed an up-regulation of FAS mRNA in PNPLA3 knockdown cells. FAS is a critical enzyme in lipogenesis and thus the compensatory of up-regulation of FAS may contribute to unchanged lipid content in PNPLA3 deficient cells. The knockout of PNPLA3 in mice, which was without effect on phenotype, supports this compensatory hypothesis.<SEP>In conclusion, our study provides strong evidence revealing that PNPLA3 is upregulated by a lipogenic diet, and suppressed by certain types of unsaturated fatty acids both in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that PNPLA3 expression is an early marker of carbohydrate-induced lipogenesis, but its expression is not associated with steatosis per se. Thus, PNPLA3 is a marker of the pathway to the lipogenic condition rather than the outcome of increased hepatic lipid accumulation.",28758,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
29302075,"Introduction<SEP>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has a well-established genetic contribution, although with a modest (30–40%) heritability. However, we have so far failed to identify vulnerability genes for this disorder. Indeed, while genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified main genetic effects for schizophrenia, autism, and bipolar disorder, even very large GWAS meta-analyses have failed to identify genome-wide significant associations in depression. Only recently, and using enormous datasets from more than 75 thousand individuals with depression and 200 thousand healthy subjects, 15 genome-wide significant loci for MDD have been identified. One of the potential reasons behind this weak genetic effect is the fact that individual genotypic variations may increase the risk of depression only in the presence of exposure to life stressors and other adverse environmental circumstances, a phenomenon named as ‘gene-environment (GxE) interaction’. Indeed, environmental factors, and in particular exposure to adversities early in life, have been consistently implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. For example, in a large study conducted by the Center of Disease Control with over 9000 participants, Chapman et al. reported a dose-response relationship between the severity of experienced childhood adversities and the lifetime presence of depressive episodes or chronic depression. However, despite the epidemiological and clinical evidence confirming these effects, there is substantial variability in the outcomes of early life stress, since not all people exposed to early adversities develop depression later in life. GxE interactions may indeed also explain why adverse environmental factors do not increase the risk of depression in each and every individual.<SEP>Two of the most established examples of GxE interactions linking stress to depression result from the hypothesis-driven investigation of the serotonin transporter promoter short/long polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and of a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) gene. Caspi and colleagues were the first to show that individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR exhibit more depressive symptoms and suicidality in the presence of stressful life events as compared with individuals homozygous for the long allele. Although not all the studies have replicated these findings, this GxE interaction has been shown to predict depression in individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment. Similarly, many studies have shown that a functional SNP within FKBP5 (rs1360780) interacts with childhood abuse to predict a multitude of psychiatric phenotypes in adults, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. For this latter gene, epigenetic mechanisms leading to different cortisol reactivity to stress seem to explain these effects. These two examples of GxE interactions are built on decades of hypothesis-driven research, and have been instrumental in order to identify not only genetic variants that increase the risk of depression, but also the potential biological and molecular mechanisms underlying this increased risk. However, as extensively discussed elsewhere, this hypothesis-driven approach can only discover a fraction of such potential existing genetic variants, and it is at odds with the current strategy of using a hypothesis-free approach to identify genes associated with disorders.<SEP>Of course, using GWAS data to test GxE interactions would be a theoretically viable option, but it would require enormous datasets with both exposure (such as life events) and outcome (depression) data. To date, only two genome-wide by environment interaction studies (GWEIS) have been performed in this regard. Dunn and colleagues (2016), using data from the SHARe cohort of the Women’s Health Initiative comprising more than 10 thousand African Americans and Hispanics/Latinas, have examined genetic main effects and GxE interactions with stressful life events and social support in the development of depressive symptoms; however, only one interaction signal was genome-wide significant in African Americans (rs4652467 located 14 kb from CEP350), and it was not replicated. The second, subsequent whole genome pilot study, performed in only 320 subjects characterized for recent stressful life events, found no interaction that was genome-wide significant.<SEP>In the current paper, we propose a different ‘omics-based’ approach to identify candidate genes for GxE interactions studies in GWAS datasets, using cross-species and cross-tissue biological prioritization strategies that limits the number of investigated genes and thus enhances the statistical power to identify significant findings. In particular, we have first analyzed the transcriptome and miRNome data from the hippocampus of adult rats exposed to prenatal stress (PNS), a well-established model of early life stress leading to depressive behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity in adulthood, in order to obtain a list of genes that are both modulated by PNS and targeted by the miRNAs that are modulated by PNS. We have then integrated the resulting genes list with transcriptome data obtained from blood mRNA of human adults who had suffered from childhood trauma, and analyzed the overlapping genes list using network analysis, which identifies genes and molecules that interact with each other because of physical interaction or co-expression, or because they are related in common signaling pathways. Finally, we have tested the top network cluster of genes for GxE interactions in order to examine the effects of early life stress on depressive symptoms in adulthood, in two different clinical samples from the Grady Trauma Project in Atlanta (USA) and the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study (Finland). In vitro experiments in a human hippocampal progenitor cell line were also conducted to confirm the role of the identified genes in stress responsivity.","Material and methods<SEP>Animal model and clinical samples<SEP>Prenatal stress model (for transcriptomics and miRNomics analyses)<SEP>PNS procedure was performed as already published; briefly, pregnant dams in the last week of gestation were restrained in a transparent Plexiglas cylinder, under bright light, for 45 min, three times a day for 1 week. Control pregnant females were left undisturbed in their home cages. Male offspring from control and PNS groups were killed at postnatal day (PND) 62 (early adulthood) for whole hippocampal dissection (for further details see Supplementary Material). Rat handling and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the EC guidelines (EC Council Directive 86/609 1987) and with the Italian legislation on animal experimentation (D.L. 116/92), in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.<SEP>Subjects exposed to early life trauma (for transcriptomics analysis)<SEP>We recruited volunteer subjects from the local population living in the area served by the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, in south-east London. Childhood traumatic events were assessed using the Childhood Experience of Care Abuse Questionnaire (CECA-Q). All the volunteers were screened using the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire (to exclude any psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms). We performed transcriptomic analyses in 20 subjects who reported at least two types of abuse (separation and physical abuse = 40%; separation and sexual abuse = 20%; physical and sexual abuse = 5%; physical and emotional abuse = 5%) or one type of severe abuse (physical abuse only = 20%; emotional abuse only = 5%; sexual abuse only = 5%); and in 20 subjects matched for age, gender and body mass index (BMI) with no history of early life trauma. Mean age ± SD was 27 ± 1.6 and 25 ± 0.9 (df = 15; ℵ2 = 0.222, p-value = 0.3), and percentage of females was 45% (7 F/13 M) and 35% (9 F/11 M) (ℵ2 = 0.417, p-value = 0.5), respectively, in the subjects with and without childhood trauma. We collected information about current medications (one subject was taking oral contraception and one was in treatment with mefenamic acid), general health (asthma, eczema, frequent headaches, recent infections), education, employment, nicotine, and cannabis smoking; the two groups were not different for any of these variables (data not showed).<SEP>Blood samples were collected by using PaxGene Blood Tubes. After collection, blood samples were kept at room temperature for 2 h, then at −20 °C for 2 days and then at −80 °C until their processing. The project was approved by the Local Ethical Committee and subjects signed a consent form (for further details see Supplementary Material).<SEP>Grady trauma project (for GxE analysis)<SEP>In the Grady Trauma Project, recruited in Atlanta (Georgia, USA), detailed trauma interviews were collected in a large sample of 4791 adults (mean age ± SD of 40.1 ± 13.9) with high rates of current and lifetime PTSD. For this study, we used the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), a 28-item, psychometrically validated inventory assessing self-reported levels of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. The presence of moderate-severe sexual, physical and emotional abuse was coded as described before. Emotional abuse was used for the main GxE analyses on early life emotional stress, across both this and the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The institutional review board at Emory University approved the study procedures. All participants provided written informed consent before participating.<SEP>Helsinki birth cohort study (for GxE analysis)<SEP>Between 2001 and 2004, 1620 individuals (mean age ± SD of 61.5 ± 2.9) who were born at Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1934 and 1944, and who were alive and living in Finland in 1971, participated into a clinical examination during which blood samples for DNA were used to obtain GWAS data for both directly genotyped and imputed SNPs. Depressive symptoms were measured using the BDI. Early life emotional stress in this samples was defined as separation from biological parents in 1939–1946, during the second world war, when around 80,000 Finnish children were sent to Sweden and Denmark in order to escape the dangers of war; 384 subjects were identified as having been separated in childhood. These children were separated by both parents and their siblings at the median age of 3.8 years (Range 0.6–10.1 years) for a mean duration of 1.4 years (Range 0.2–4.7 years), thus severely disrupting the attachment to significant caregivers. Previous studies in this cohort have clearly shown that these subjects show worse mental health in adulthood. For example, they report almost double the risk of experiencing depressive symptoms over time and have higher risks of mental disorders, including substance abuse and personality disorders. Interestingly for the context of our paper, they also show higher cortisol levels and more pronounced cortisol reactivity. The project was approved by the Local Ethical Committee (for further details see Supplementary Material).<SEP>Biological assessments<SEP>mRNA and miRNA isolation from hippocampus of animals and from the blood of subjects<SEP>Total RNA, including miRNAs, was isolated from rat brain tissues by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Italy) and from human blood samples using PaxGene miRNA kit (Qiagen, Italy), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were also treated with DNase, and RNA quantity and quality was assessed by evaluation of the A260/280 and A260/230 ratios using a Nanodrop spectrometer (NanoDrop Technologies).<SEP>Whole Genome expression microarray analyses in the hippocampus of animals and in the blood of subjects<SEP>Gene expression microarray assays were performed using Rat Gene 2.1st Array Strips (which covers 27,147 coding transcripts) or Human Gene 2.1st Array Strips (which covers 31,650 coding transcripts) on GeneAtlas platform (Affymetrix), following the WT Expression Kit protocol described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, and as we have done before (for further details see Supplementary Material). Of note, this is the first report of the rat hippocampal transcriptome following PNS using the novel Rat Gene 2.1st Array Strips, hence we have reported here all the relevant data and pathways analyses.<SEP>Real Time validation analyses of transcriptomic findings in the hippocampus of animals and in the blood of subjects<SEP>All the genes that were significantly modulated by stress both in the hippocampus of animals and in the blood of subjects (n = 22 genes, see Results Section) were validated using Real-Time PCR by using Biorad qPCR Mix (BioRad, Milan) and Taqman Assays on a 96 wells Real Time PCR System (One Step TaqMan Real Time PCR). Each sample was assayed in triplicate and each target gene was normalized to β-actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in rodents, and to β−2-microglobulin (B2M) and GAPDH in humans. The Pfaffl Method was used to determine relative target gene expression.<SEP>MiRNome expression analysis in the hippocampus of animals<SEP>Five hundred nanogram of total RNA (including miRNAs) were processed with the FlashTag Biotin HSR RNA Labeling kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and subsequently hybridized onto the GeneChip miRNA 4.1 Array Strip on a GeneAtlas platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The GeneChip miRNA 4.1 Array Strip shows a comprehensive coverage as they are designed to interrogate all mature miRNA sequences in miRBase Release 20. Washing/staining and scanning procedures were conducted on the Fluidics station following the manufacturer’s instructions.<SEP>Genotyping of polymorphisms within the Grady Trauma Study<SEP>DNA was extracted from saliva in Oragene collection vials (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, ON, Canada) using the DNAdvance kit (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA, USA), while DNA from blood was extracted using either the E.Z.N.A. Mag-Bind Blood DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) or ArchivePure DNA Blood Kit (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). N = 4,791 subjects were genotyped on the HumanOmniExpress (6%) and the Omni1-Quad BeadChip (94%) (Illumina Inc), and genotypes were called with Illumina’s Genome Studio. The HumanOmniExpress interrogates 730,525 individual SNPs per sample, whereas the Omni1- Quad BeadChip interrogates 1,011,219 individual SNPs (for further details see Supplementary Material).<SEP>Genotyping of polymorphisms in the helsinki birth cohort study<SEP>DNA was extracted from blood samples using Gentra Kit. Participants were genotyped with the modified Illumina 610 k array, at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK according to standard protocols (for further details see Supplementary Material).<SEP>Statistical and bioinformatics analysis<SEP>Transcriptomic and miRNome statistical analysis<SEP>Raw data were imported and analyzed with the software Partek Genomic Suite 6.6 (Partek, St. Louis, MO, USA). We checked for quality control and batch effects using the Principal Component Analyses (PCA) in the Partek Genomic Suite Software, and we did not observe any outlier or any batch effect, thus we did not correct for this. After quality control of the data, Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed to assess the effects of PNS on genes expression or miRNAs expression in rats, and of history of early life adversities on gene expression in humans. A maximum filter of p < 0.05 (FDR corrected) and a minimum absolute fold change cut-off of 1.4 in animals and of 1.2 in humans was applied to select the lists of significant genes. The miRNAs-mRNAs combining analyses was performed using a specific sub-feature in Partek Genomic Suite 6.6. For blood transcriptome, possible differences in cell type between the two groups were evaluated by using CellMix package builds on R/BioConductor and available from http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~renaud/CRAN/web/CellMix, and as we have not detected differences in childhood trauma exposed subjects as compared to non-exposed individuals we did not use it as covariate.<SEP>Pathway analyses<SEP>List of significant genes were analyzed for pathway analyses by using Ingenuity Pathway Analyses Software (IPA) where, as a background, we used gene lists that we obtained applying the minimum absolute fold change cut-off of 1.4 in animals and of 1.2 in humans and q-value <0.05.<SEP>Animal and human integration data<SEP>The genes lists deriving from rats (following miRNAs-mRNAs combining analyses) and humans (mRNAs only) were cross-integrated, and the list of common genes was tested for random probability by Hyper-Geometric Distribution test in R.<SEP>Network analyses<SEP>The list of common genes from animal and human data were used for network analyses using specific tools in IPA.<SEP>GXE interactions<SEP>Grady trauma project<SEP>We transformed imputed genotypes to best guessed genotypes using a probability threshold of 90%. To assess GxE interaction, we individually tested each SNP within the three genes of interest resulting from the final network analysis and also available in the Helsinki Birth cohort study, for interactions between emotional stress (emotional abuse) and BDI scores in adulthood, as a similar phenotype was also present in the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. Age, gender, and the first two principal components of the identity-by-state (IBS) matrix were used as covariates in the linear regression analyses in R. We made further adjustments for SNP X covariate and child abuse X covariate interactions, as suggested by Keller. In addition, secondary analyses were conducted testing GxE interaction between each type of childhood trauma (emotional, sexual and physical abuse) and BDI scores in adulthood, in this sample only.<SEP>Helsinki birth cohort study<SEP>We tested those SNPs within the three genes of interest resulting from the final network analysis that were also available in the Grady Trauma Project, for interactions between emotional stress (whether the individual was separated from parents during WWII, or not) and BDI scores in adulthood, using linear regression analysis. Each SNP was tested in a separate model; age at testing, gender, and the first three principal components of the IBS matrix, main effects of the gene and the environment were used as covariates. We made further adjustments for SNP × covariate and separation status × covariate interactions, as suggested by Keller.<SEP>Meta-analyses<SEP>We ran a fixed-effects meta-analysis combining the interaction results testing emotional stress in both cohorts, using the R-package Rmeta. Meta-analysis p-values were corrected for multiple testing using Bonferroni-correction over all tested SNPs.<SEP>Cell culture, gene expression and neurogenesis assay<SEP>The immortalized, multipotent human fetal hippocampal progenitor cell line, HPC0A07/03C (propriety of ReNeuron), was used for all cellular and molecular analyses (mRNA levels, neuronal proliferation). Details of this cell line, the proliferation protocol, gene expression and immunocytochemistry can be found in Supplementary Information Materials and Methods.","Results<SEP>Transcriptomic changes in the hippocampus of adult male rats following PNS<SEP>Our first aim was to identify gene expression changes in the hippocampus of male adult rats (at PND 62) that had been exposed to PNS. We analyzed the entire transcriptome and we found a significant modulation of 916 genes in the comparison with control animals (using 1.4 < FC < −1.4, q-value <0.05). We have visualized the most significant genes in a hierarchical clustering in Fig. 1, and listed the 916 significant genes in Supplementary Table 1.<SEP>We then performed a pathway analysis on the significantly modulated genes, in order to identify the main biological processes involved. We identified 49 biological processes that were altered by the PNS exposure, including some involved in neurodevelopment (Axonal Guidance Signaling, Protein Kinase A Signaling, Glutamate Receptor Signaling, Wnt/β-catenin Signaling, CREB Signaling in Neurons, Synaptic Long Term Depression, Synaptic Long Term Potentiation, Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling) and inflammation (IL-8 Signaling, STAT3 Pathway, CDK5 Signaling, IL-1 Signaling, IL-6 Signaling, BMP signaling pathway and TGF-β Signaling). All the significant pathways are summarized by the pie-chart detailing the relevant functional areas (Fig. 2a), while the entire list of significant pathways is presented in Supplementary Table 2. We conducted the subsequent target prioritization steps using the full list of 916 differentially regulated genes.<SEP>MiRNome changes in the hippocampus of PNS rats, and combined analyses with transcriptomic changes<SEP>We subsequently investigated whether exposure to PNS causes changes in miRNAs levels, and whether the identified miRNAs could target transcripts identified in the transcriptomics analysis. After the selection of the species (Rattus Norvegicus), we identified a total number of 1218 miRNAs (including pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs); out of these, 68 miRNAs (47 of them were mature miRNAs) were significantly modulated (all with q-value <0.05) in animals exposed to prenatal stress, with sixty-five downregulated and only 3 up-regulated (see Table 1).<SEP>As both transcriptomic and miRNome analyses were conducted in the hippocampus of the same animals, we then performed a mRNA-miRNAs combining analysis that allows the identification of a panel of top-hit genes that were both modulated by PNS exposure and targeted by the miRNAs that were modulated by PNS (see Methods). These analyses identified 528 significant genes, presented in Supplementary Table 3. The specific pathways analysis shows that these were genes involved in neurodevelopment (Axonal Guidance, Protein Kinase-A Signaling, Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling, TGF-β Signaling) and inflammation (STAT3 Pathway, PTEN Signaling, ILK Signaling, IL-8 signaling); the full list of the 42 pathways is presented in Supplementary Table 4.<SEP>Blood mRNA transcriptomics of early life trauma in humans<SEP>Comparing subjects with and without exposure to early life trauma (see Methods for sociodemographic and clinical information), we identified 250 genes that were differentially modulated (FC > 1.2, FDR q-value <0.05) (see Supplementary Table 5), involved in the modulation of 41 significant pathways. Of note, these were, again, pathways involved in neurodevelopment (Wnt/Ca + pathway, cAMP signaling, CREB signaling) and inflammation (eNOS signaling, chemokine signaling, B cell activation), similar to what we found in the PNS model. All the significant pathways are summarized by the pie-chart detailing the relevant functional areas in Fig. 2b, and listed in Supplementary Table 6.<SEP>Integrating data from PNS in animals and from early life trauma in humans<SEP>In the next step, we integrated the 528 genes obtained by combined mRNA/miRNA analyses in the hippocampus of rats exposed to PNS with the 250 genes significantly modulated in the blood of adults exposed to early life trauma. We identified 22 common genes that were present in both lists; according to the hypergeometric distribution test, the probability that these genes were not overlapping due to random probability was p = 1.8 × 10–8.<SEP>Finally, we validated all of the 22 genes by Real–Time PCR, both in the hippocampus of animals and in the blood of adults exposed to childhood trauma. In line with the microarray results, 16 genes were modulated in the same direction both in the rat hippocampus and in the human blood, and 6 were modulated in the opposite direction. Specifically, 15 were up-regulated in both: Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M), AT-Rich Interaction Domain 5B (ARID5B), Arrestin Domain Containing 4 (ARRDC4), EPH Receptor A4 (EPHA4), F-Box Protein 32 (FBXO32), Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), Heat Shock Transcription Factor 2 (HSF2), Isochorismatase Domain Containing 1 (ISOC1), Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor Adapter Protein 1 (LDLRAP1), Leucine-rich repeat neuronal protein 3 (LRRN3), Myosin ID (MYO1D), Phosphatidylinositol-4-Phosphate 3-Kinase, Catalytic Subunit Type 2 Beta (PIK3C2B), Phosphatidic Acid Phosphatase Type 2A (PPAP2A), Sterile Alpha Motif Domain Containing 12 (SAMD12), and Serine Incorporator 5 (SERINC5); one was down-regulated in both: Transforming Growth Factor, Beta 1 (TGF-β1); one was up-regulated in rats and down-regulated in humans: Solute Carrier Family 24 (Sodium/Potassium/Calcium Exchanger) Member 3 (SLC24A3); and 5 were down-regulated in rats and up-regulated in humans: B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL2), B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 9 (BCL9), Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1 (LEF1), Lin-54 DREAM MuvB Core Complex Component (LIN54), and Post-GPI Attachment to Proteins 1 (PGAP1). These genes are presented in Supplementary Table 7, where we also present the FCs obtained from the microarray studies and the FCs from Real Time PCR analyses. For all the above-mentioned molecular and biochemical analyses, all data met the assumptions of normal distribution and equality of variance.<SEP>Gene network analysis and selection of candidates for GxE interaction<SEP>We focused on the 16 genes (A2M, ARID5B, ARRDC4, EPHA4, FBXO32, FoxO1, HSF2, ISOC1, LDLRAP1, LRRN3, MYO1D, PIK3C2B, PPAP2A, SAMD12, SERINC5, and TGF-β1) that were modulated in the same direction both in animals and in humans, and we applied a gene network analysis to identify possible interactions among these genes. Indeed, our main theoretical framework was based on the notion that depression is a complex disorder, where multiple genes interact with each other as belonging to common or overlapping signaling systems. Therefore, also to minimize any chance findings, we decided a priori to select, for the subsequent GxE interaction analyses, only those genes that interacted with each other through physical interaction, co-expression or involvement in common pathways.<SEP>Using IPA Software, we observed only one cluster of interacting genes, represented by A2M, FoxO1 and TGF-β1 (Fig. 3). Using a gene enrichment/pathway analysis, we then confirmed that this cluster is involved in cytokines signaling, TGF- β1 signaling and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. As we found that A2M, FoxO1, and TGF-β1 form a single individual cluster of genes interacting with each other, we focused on these three genes for the subsequent GxE studies.<SEP>Gene X environment interaction studies<SEP>For our main analyses, we focused on all the SNPs located in these three genes and available in both the Grady Trauma Project and Helsinki Birth cohort (FoxO1, n = 132 SNPs; A2M, n = 91 SNPs; and TGF-β1, n = 14 SNPs), and we tested their interaction with emotional stress in childhood in predicting depressive symptoms in adulthood (BDI scores) for both cohorts (Table 2). Then, we assessed the combined effect over both cohorts and performed a meta-analysis (See Supplementary Table 8). The meta-analyses indicated that 6 SNPs, all located within the FoxO1 gene, were significantly associated with emotional stress in predicting depressive symptoms, and also survived multiple testing correction for GxE interactions, with the SNP rs17592371 showing the strongest significance (p = 0.003, Bonferroni correction). For all the 6 SNPs, p-values for heterogeneity of effects were not significant, indicating that fixed-effects meta-analysis was justified. The GxE interaction effect for the SNP rs17592371 in both cohorts is presented in Fig. 4, where we can see that individuals with “at risk” genotypes (CC) developed more depressive symptoms in the presence of early separation as compared to individuals with the “low risk” genotypes (CT and TT).<SEP>We also conducted additional, secondary analyses on these three genes, in the Grady Trauma Project sample, because it has a wider range of abuse phenotypes. Specifically, we tested the interaction between childhood sexual, physical or emotional abuse, and depressive symptoms in adulthood (BDI scores). Within FoxO1, 6 SNPs showed significant GxE interactions with sexual abuse, 40 SNPs with physical abuse and 40 SNPS with emotional abuse (although with a large overlap between SNPs); within A2M, 7 SNPs showed significant GxE interactions with emotional abuse; and within TGF-β1, 4 SNPs showed significant GxE interactions with sexual abuse and 1 SNP with emotional abuse (See Supplementary Table 9).<SEP>FoxO1 is activated in hippocampal progenitor stem cells following cortisol exposure, and it mediates the negative effect of stress on neurogenesis<SEP>As FoxO1 was up-regulated both in the hippocampus of animals exposed to PNS and in the blood of subjects exposed to childhood trauma, and it was also the most significant gene from our GxE analyses across the two clinical cohorts, we decided to test the functional relevance of this gene. Specifically, we wanted to test: 1) whether the stress-induced FoxO1 upregulation could be replicated in vitro upon treatment with the human stress hormone, cortisol, using our established model of ‘depression in a dish’, the immortalized, multipotent human fetal hippocampal progenitor cell line (HPC0A07/03C); and 2) whether FoxO1 is involved in the cortisol-induced reduction of neuronal proliferation that we had previously described in this model.<SEP>Consistent with our hypothesis, FoxO1 mRNA levels were significantly increased following 24 h of treatment with 100 μM cortisol (FC = + 3.9, p < 0.0001, Fig. 5a). Moreover, the cell-permeable inhibitor of FoxO1, AS1842856 (100 nM), was able to completely inhibit the cortisol-induced upregulation of FoxO1 (Fig. 5a) and the cortisol-induced reduction in neuronal proliferation (BrdU + cells; one-way ANOVA, p = 0.01 versus cortisol, Fig. 5b, c). AS1842856 alone did not exert any effects on proliferation (p = 0.9), indicating that FoxO1 mediates the effect of stress, but it is not active under baseline conditions.<SEP>Finally, in order to investigate the molecular pathways by which FoxO1 signaling regulates the effects of stress on neuronal proliferation, we measured also the mRNA levels of a stress- and cortisol-induced gene, the Serum Glucocorticoid Kinase 1 (SGK-1), again following cortisol with or without AS1842856. SGK1 is a stress responsive gene that mediates some of the glucocorticoid effects on brain function, including the negative effects of cortisol on neurogenesis, and we found that SGK1 is elevated in both the hippocampus of stressed rats and in the blood of depressed patients. We found that 24 h of cortisol (100 uM) treatment up-regulates SGK1 mRNA levels (FC = + 3.7, p < 0.0001, Fig. 5a), replicating again our previous findings, and that AS1842856 was able to counteract such changes (Fig. 5a).","Discussion<SEP>We provide a novel ‘hypothesis-free’ approach for the identification and prioritization of candidate genes that can be investigated in GWAS datasets to test GxE interaction studies in depression. In particular, by employing “omics” approaches in animals (mRNAs and miRNAs) and in humans (mRNAs), and cross-species validation, we have identified one cluster of genes, comprising FoxO1, A2M, and TGF-β1, that show significant GxE interactions predicting adult depression in the context of early life trauma in our study, and have also been previously involved in the regulation of mechanisms relevant to stress and depression. Our main findings, confirmed by a meta-analysis run on both cohorts, indicate that several SNPs within FoxO1 interact with emotional stress during childhood in predicting adult depression, both in the Grady Trauma Project, as well as in the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. Importantly, we also describe a functional role of FoxO1 in stress responsivity in our in vitro model of human hippocampal progenitor cells. In addition, secondary analyses show that several SNPs within FoxO1, A2M, and TGF-β1 interact with emotional, physical and sexual abuse in predicting adult depression in the Grady Trauma Project.<SEP>A large body of evidence has rapidly accumulated over the past years describing interactive effects of genetic factors and early life stressors in determining the risk of depression. These ‘hypothesis-driven’ studies have mostly focused on genetic variations in candidate genes acting in neurobiological systems that have been previously implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression. As mentioned in the Introduction, the most consistent examples of this approach are studies examining the 5-HTTLPR SNP in the serotonin transporter and several functional SNPs within FKBP5. However, numerous studies, and some meta-analyses, have produced discrepant results. New gene-environment interactions continue to be reported in psychiatry, including in genes as biologically varied as BDNF, CD38, ADCYAP1R1, DRD2 and GRIN2B, but always from hypothesis-driven research, which has a high risk of non-replication. Indeed, considering the current emphasis on omics-based approach in genetic-research, and especially in the context of a paucity of significant genetic effects for depression in GWAS studies, other statistical and biological prioritization strategies need to be developed to facilitate a systematic discovery of novel gene-environment interactions in genome-wide analyses. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report of a hypothesis-free, omics-, cross-tissues and cross-species approach to identify candidate genes for GxE interaction analyses. Interestingly, Mamdani and colleagues (2015) recently used a similar approach to detect genes of interest in the context of alcohol dependence, combining data from mRNA and miRNA expression patterns in the brain of 18 patients with alcohol dependence and 18 matched controls; although they did not test for GxE interactions, they identified a network of hub genes that was enriched for genes identified by the Alcohol Dependence Genome Wide Association Study.<SEP>Our strongest findings, replicated in both clinical cohorts, pertain to FoxO1. FoxO1 belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a distinct forkhead domain; it is the main target of insulin signaling, it regulates metabolic homeostasis in response to oxidative stress, it is modulated by glucocorticoids and it enhances inflammation. It is also an important regulator of cell death acting downstream of Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (AKT1) and macrophage stimulating 1 (MST1), and indeed several studies have suggested that activation of FoxO1 contributes to glucocorticoid-induced cell death. Importantly, FoxO1 is also involved in the maintenance of human embryonic stem cells pluripotency, a function that is mediated through direct control by FoxO1 of OCT4 and SOX2 gene expression, through occupation and activation of their respective promoters.<SEP>The six FoxO1 SNPs that were found associated with emotional stress in both cohorts are intronic SNPs, and therefore the mechanisms of action remain unclear, although likely affecting gene expression and not the function of the gene product. It is also possible that these SNPs can influence the protein conformation or the accessibility to phosphorylation sites. Indeed, a number of kinases can phosphorylate and regulate FoxO1 proteins either positively or negatively, including AKT serine/threonine protein kinase downstream of the PI(3)K (phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase) signaling pathway, as well as SGK1, a kinase that is specifically activated by stress, glucocorticoids and depression. In particular, SGK1 phosphorylates FoxO1 at different sites, leading to subcellular redistribution of FoxO1 from the nucleus to the cytosol. Of note, we have previously described that SGK1 mediates the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on neurogenesis, and that its blood mRNA expression levels are elevated in patients with major depression. Moreover, in the present paper we show that the glucocorticoid, cortisol, induces the mRNA levels of both FoxO1 and SGK1, and that an inhibition of FoxO1 prevents the SGK1 upregulation, indicating that this could be dependent on FoxO1, and thus that SGK1 may represent a novel target gene for FoxO1. Interestingly, Kaiser et al., had shown similar findings in mouse pancreatic islet cells, although their paper only identified FoxO1 as a target of SGK1, and not vice versa. Taking into account also this last study, it is possible to speculate that FoxO1 activation during stress stimulates SGK1 activation, which could then further enhance FoxO1 phosphorylation.<SEP>There is some limited evidence already for a role of FoxOs in psychiatric disorders. Indeed FoxOs, especially FoxO6, are mainly expressed in hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens, which are important brain areas involved in aversive and rewarding responses to emotional stimuli, suggesting that FoxOs may be involved in the regulation of mood and emotion. Moreover, FoxOs are regulated by antidepressants, as well as serotonin and norepinephrine receptor signaling. Indeed, FoxO3a has emerged as a candidate gene involved in bipolar and unipolar disorders. Moreover, in a learned helplessness animal model, inescapable shocks significantly reduce the phosphorylation of FoxO3a and induces the nuclear location of FoxO3a in the cerebral cortex; moreover, learned helplessness behavior is markedly diminished in FoxO3a-deficient mice. These results are consistent with the report that FoxO3a influences behavioral processes linked to anxiety and depression, and that FoxO3a- deficient mice show reduced depressive behavior while FoxO1 KO mice displayed reduced anxiety behavior. This is in line with our finding in the present paper, as we describe higher levels of FoxO1 in the brain of rats exposed to prenatal stress, in the blood of subjects exposed to childhood trauma, and in cells treated with the stress hormone, cortisol; moreover, in vitro FoxO1 mediates the cortisol-induced reduction of neuronal proliferation. Together, these data indicate that enhanced levels of FoxO1 due to stress exposure are associated with enhanced vulnerability to develop stress related disorders.<SEP>The findings that both A2M and TGF-β1 have SNPs with significant GxE interactions in the Grady Trauma Project, albeit limited by the secondary nature of the analyses and the lack of a replication sample, still are of some interest, as both genes have been implicated in biological processes relevant to depression. A2M has traditionally been viewed as an inflammatory fluid proteinase scavenger, and recent studies have demonstrated the ability of A2M to bind to a plethora of cytokines, including TGF-β1. TGF-β1, in turn, is a member of TGF-β superfamily, which regulates neuronal survival, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and gliogenesis. Similar to the present study, where we found increased A2M mRNA levels following stress both in the rodent hippocampus and in the human blood, A2M is elevated in clinical samples and in experimental models relevant to depression; for example, higher levels of blood A2M are present in patients with total gastrectomy that develop depression, indicating that A2M elevation may be implicated in depression pathogenesis in the context of a pro-inflammatory status; and fishes subjected to the stress of repeated emersions show higher blood levels of A2M. High levels of A2M have indeed been associated with systemic inflammation, and therefore it is possible to speculate that the high levels of A2M described in this and other studies may translate into an increased risk of depression by activating the inflammatory system. TGF-β1, in contrast, is reduced in conditions related to stress and depression, in the present study, as well as in previous studies. For example, TGF-β1 levels are reduced in the blood of depressed patients, and we have previously shown that the TGF-β1-SMAD signaling is one of the pathways that is most significantly down-regulated in neurons by in vitro exposures to high concentrations of cortisol, which mimics depression in vitro and negatively affects neurogenesis. Finally, is of note that several SNPs within A2M and TGF-β1, including those that we have identified through our GxE interaction analyses, are associated with the development of several Complex Diseases and Disorders (see genetic association database from complex diseases and disorders https://geneticassociationdb.nih.gov). Moreover, genetic variants in TGF-β1 have been associated with other brain disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer disease.<SEP>It is important to emphasize that GxE interactions, while based on the effects of specific changes in DNA sequence, are likely to involve epigenetic mechanisms. For example, recent studies have shown that the above-mentioned functional polymorphism in the FKBP5 gene increases the risk of developing depression and PTSD in adulthood by allele-specific, childhood trauma–dependent DNA demethylation in functional glucocorticoid response elements of FKBP5, followed by a long-term dysregulation of the stress hormone system and a global effect on the function of immune cells and of brain areas associated with stress regulation. Besides DNA methylation, miRNAs have also recently emerged as important in the long-term regulation of gene expression associated with stress early in life. The ability of miRNAs to selectively and reversibly silence the mRNAs of their target genes, together with their involvement in biological processes modulated by stressful life events, make miRNAs well-suited to serve as fine regulators of the complex and extensive molecular network involved in stress response; hence, our decision in this paper of merging transcriptomics and miRNomics data in the selection of top-hit genes.<SEP>There are two limitations in our study that should be mentioned. First, only interactions with emotional stress were tested in both samples, and six FoxO1 SNPs survived multiple-testing correction and were confirmed by meta-analysis; the other SNPs in FoxO1, A2M and TGF-β1 that were associated with multiple types of abuse were only tested in the Grady Trauma sample, in secondary analyses. We trust that the use of a different clinical population (the South-East London sample) to generate transcriptomics, together with the cross-species validation, support the relevance of all of our findings, including the evidence for A2M and TGF-β1, but clearly these secondary analyses are only exploratory at this stage. Second, the samples size of the cohort of adult subjects with a history of childhood trauma used for transcriptomic analyses is relatively small, with n = 20 subjects per group. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first gene expression microarray study comparing the transcriptome in subjects exposed to childhood trauma versus non-exposed individuals, and thus provides informative findings. Moreover, the validity of our transcriptomics results is strengthened by the fact that we compare subjects not exposed to early life trauma with subjects exposed to the most severe types of trauma or to more than one traumatic event, thus maximizing the biological differences between the two groups. Finally, only the genes regulated also in the animal brains were selected for the further genetic association analyses, again strengthening the validity of our findings. All together, these lines of evidence defend the appropriateness of our sample size for the transcriptomics analyses.<SEP>In conclusion, our data provide a novel approach for the selection of novel susceptibility genes for GxE interaction in depression, alternative to ‘hypothesis-driven research’ and resulting in the prioritization of candidate genes starting from a ‘hypothesis-free’ approach. The evidence that the three identified genes all interact with environmental stress in inducing depressive symptoms, and that the statistically strongest gene, FoxO1, has functional relevance in stress-induced reduction of neurogenesis, support our theoretical framework. We propose that our prioritization strategy will limit the number of investigated genes in GWAS-based GxE interaction studies and thus will enhance the statistical power to identify significant findings. Moreover, we propose that FoxO1 may represent a target for the development of novel pharmacological therapies to prevent or treat stress-induced mental disorders.",44618,['OBWCCE']
26337695,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>There is wide variability in weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) but the reasons for this variability are incompletely understood. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with obesity or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are logical targets in investigations into genetic contributors to this variation. A few published studies have examined obesity or WHR GWAS SNPs with weight loss after bariatric surgery but have either included only a few SNPs, used simplistic statistical methods, or used datasets with limited follow-up. To better understand how these SNPs may contribute to long-term weight loss after RYGB surgery, we examined the association of 34 SNPs with weight loss up to 9.5 years after bariatric surgery using linear mixed methods and several secondary measures of long-term weight loss.","MATERIALS AND METHODS<SEP>Participants and data<SEP>Participants for this study were drawn from the NUgene biobank; individuals in NUGene were recruited at Northwestern Medicine Clinics or Evanston Northwestern Hospital (now NorthShore University HealthSystem), provided a blood sample for DNA extraction, completed an entrance questionnaire, and gave permission for use of their electronic health records (EHR) in research. Participants in NUGene who had undergone RYGB surgery were identified through International Classification of Diseases -9-9 and Current Procedural Terminology codes. Information about pre- and post-surgical weights were extracted from EHR while demographic data, including race, were obtained from the entrance questionnaire. Details about assembly of the study population and data extraction have been published previously. Patients undergoing reoperations and surgical-take downs were excluded.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>We sought to genotype all SNPs that reached genome-wide levels of significance in the largest (at the time of genotyping) GWAS of BMI and WHR. The iPLEX GOLD procedure was followed for the SNP analysis. Briefly, Sequenom’s Assay Design software was used to create five multiplexed reactions for all SNPs of interest. After extending the primers the products were conditioned and spotted onto SpectroChip Arrays. Extended primers were detected by MassArray Analyzer 4 using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight (MALDITOF) method. Data was acquired using the TyperAnalyzer Software from Agena Bioscience (formerly Sequenom). During the design phase of the assay, it was determined that some SNPs would not genotype well on the system and the SNAP browser was used to pick suitable proxies in the Caucasian population. All SNPs having genotyping rates below 95% were discarded, as were SNPs with HWE p-values less than .01. 34 of 46 SNPs passed these quality control filters. The rs numbers of these SNPs are included in a footnote to Table 1.<SEP>Outcome Measures<SEP>In all models, percent weight lost from surgery ([post-surgical weight values-surgery weight]/surgery weight) was used as it has been suggested this phenotype facilitates the most sensitive identification of novel predictors of surgery-induced weight loss. We included all individuals (n=162) who had at least 1 weight observation 1-year after surgery, and subsequently restricted this to genotyped self-reported whites (n=95). Our primary outcome was long term percent weight loss predicted by a linear mixed model. We chose a linear mixed model including repeated measures of weight obtained at least 1 year after bariatric surgery with a random intercept and unstructured covariance matrix. Each SNP was tested individually in an unadjusted linear mixed model with and without an additional test for interaction with time. In recognition of limited power and to replicate earlier studies, we chose to examine multiple secondary measures of weight loss after bariatric surgery, and to prioritize those SNPs having nominally significant (p < .05) associations with multiple measures of weight loss. Our secondary outcomes included lowest percent weight loss recorded post-surgery (percent weight loss nadir), percent weight loss at 1 year (weight measure obtained closest to 1 year after surgery in a range of 12–18 months), percent weight loss at 2 years (range 18–30 months), and long term weight loss trajectories estimated by SAS Proc trajectory. We had previously used a semiparametric, group-based mixture model (SAS Proc Traj) to create trajectory models of percent weight loss from one-year post surgery in this study. We tested the statistical significance of each SNP against previously calculated trajectory groups using Pearson’s Chi-Squared.<SEP>After selection of independently associated demographic predictors (gender, surgery age, surgery weight, height, and recruitment center), SNPs were singly included as additional covariates modeled additively, with each additional unit reflecting an additional copy of the minor allele of each SNP. Mixed linear regression models were additionally adjusted for time since surgery and a time*age interaction term.","RESULTS<SEP>Demographics<SEP>Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Table 1 presents the demographics of the 95 whites with successful genotyping for analysis, both in total, and by rs477112 genotype. The median number of weight observations one-year or more after surgery per participant was 8, and the average length (SD) of follow-up after surgery was 5.6 (2.2) years, with some individuals having as long as 9.5 years of follow up. There were 1634 weight observations in the dataset. Eighty-one (85%) participants were female, reflecting a typical distribution of bariatric surgery patients in the United States.<SEP>Obesity and WHR GWAS SNP associations with long term weight loss after bariatric surgery<SEP>A table including P-values and beta estimates for the association of all 34 SNPs with our primary and secondary outcomes reflecting long-term weight loss is available from the authors. No SNP achieved a Bonferroni corrected (.05/34 = .0017) p-value for association with long term weight loss examined in a linear mixed model. SNP rs4771122 achieved the lowest p-value for association with this trait of p = .0035. SNP rs4771122 was also nominally significantly associated with trajectory group membership, nadir percent weight loss, and 2 year percent weight loss. No other SNP was associated with multiple outcomes.<SEP>Table 2 presents beta estimates and p-values for the association of rs4771122 with our primary and secondary measures of long-term weight loss. In all cases, additional copies of the minor (G) allele were associated with a larger percentage weight lost, after adjustment for several variables including pre-surgical BMI. As seen in table 1, in this sample, additional copies of the minor (G) allele were also significantly associated with increased pre-surgical weight. We examined the association of rs4771122 with pre-surgical weight, nadir weight loss, 2 year weight loss, long term weight loss by mixed models, and long term weight loss by trajectories in 52 self-identified blacks genotyped for our study and found no significant associations.",,7230,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS', 'FOODIN']"
31063852,"Introduction<SEP>Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) refers to a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of monogenic forms of diabetes. MODY is characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, young onset typically before 35 years of age, and a non-insulin-dependent clinical presentation. To date, 14 genetically distinct subtypes of MODY have been described and collectively account for about 2-5% of all diabetes cases. Glucokinase (gene symbol-GCK), a key enzyme in glucose metabolism, regulates insulin secretion in response to variations in blood glucose levels. Loss of function mutations in the heterozygous state in GCK cause GCK-MODY (formerly known as MODY-2), which is characterized by mild non-progressive fasting hyperglycemia which is present at birth but typically detected incidentally during routing medical screening. Fasting blood glucose typically ranges from 5.5-8 mmol/L, and there is usually a small incremental rise in blood glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test (generally below 3 mmol/L). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are mildly elevated and usually range between 5.6-7.6%. Despite lifelong mild hyperglycemia, microvascular and macrovascular complications are rare in patients with pathogenic GCK variants and pharmacological intervention is rarely required outside of pregnancy. There are now over 800 reported variants in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) distributed throughout most of the coding regions and the exon—intron boundaries of the GCK gene. Pathogenic GCK variants are present in 1 in 1000 individuals, yet most cases of GCK-MODY are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved US Monogenic Diabetes Registry, housed at the University of Chicago, was established to correctly diagnose and follow families with monogenic forms of diabetes (http://monogenicdiabetes.uchicago.edu/). To date, 1552 families with a known or suspected form of monogenic diabetes have been consented for participation in the Registry. A total of 371 families were found to have pathogenic mutations causative of MODY of which 189 were found to have a previously reported pathogenic variant causative of GCK-MODY. Here, we describe the molecular characteristics and associated clinical features of 27 unreported GCK variants identified in 28 families.","Materials and Methods<SEP>Within the Registry a clinical diagnosis of GCK-MODY was suspected in patients with persistent mild fasting hyperglycemia and/or an HbA1c level within the expected range for GCK-MODY. A genetic diagnosis was performed using Sanger sequencing or a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel as described previously. Briefly, NGS data quality was assessed using fastQC and aligned to the hg19 reference using Burrow-Wheeler Aligner. Variants were called using the Genome analysis Toolkit based on the best practices for variant discovery and annotated using Alamut Batch (Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France). Variants with a global frequency >1% in EXAC were excluded. Three different computational tools (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and Human Splice Finder) were used to obtain pathogenicity predictions for each variant. All variants were classified based on degree of pathogenicity (pathogenic/likely pathogenic, variant of uncertain significance (VUS), and benign/likely benign) in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines. Pathogenic variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and co-segregation with the diabetic phenotype was evaluated by targeted sequencing analysis of enrolled family members. HGMD and Pubmed were used to determine whether the variant was previously reported. ClinVar was used as a reliable source supporting variant interpretation. However, sequence changes identified in this study that were reported in ClinVar but not previously published were considered novel.","Results<SEP>Through December 2018, 359 people were referred for suspected or confirmed GCK-MODY, with 217 probands testing positive for a GCK variant either by Sanger sequencing or MODY gene panel. Of these, 72% were tested either on a research or clinical basis through the University of Chicago. Seventy-four probands have yet to be tested. Clinical information was available for a subset of probands with GCK variants (Table 1). Overall, clinical findings were similar to those with previously described pathogenic GCK variants in the. Sequence analysis identified 134 GCK variants in 217 families from the year 2008 to 2018. Of these, 107 variants were previously reported in the literature as causal. The remaining 27 variants, present in 28 probands, were to the best of our knowledge not previously described or reported (Table 2). These included 17 missense, 1 nonsense, 2 splice sites, 1 in-frame deletion, 1 in-frame duplication, and 5 insertions/deletions. After interpretation using the ACMG guidelines, 26% (7/27) of the novel GCK variants were found to be pathogenic, 56% (15/27) were likely pathogenic and 18% (5/27) were of uncertain significance. All novel variants except for Met210dup were identified in a single family. Seven variants (p.Lys13X, p.Leu185Pro, p.Val207Leu, p.Glu227Hisfs*47, p.Cys252Trp, p.Arg275Leu, and p.Ser281Pro) were previously reported by our group [, Supplementary Table] but are not included in the professional version of HGMD and are therefore further described in Table 2. Parental or extended family DNA was available for 10 out of 28 probands and co-segregation with the diabetes phenotype was established in those cases. Four of the five VUS (p.Ser127Pro, p.His141Pro, c.579+4delA, and p.Leu307Phe) were predicted to be damaging by in-silico tools. However, due to the lack of segregation data and/or phenotypic data on family members, these variants did not satisfy classification requirements for pathogenic or likely pathogenic. The p.Leu307Phe sequence change was identified in one proband with no family history of diabetes. Targeted sequencing of the parents’ DNA did not detect this sequence change and was thus presumed to be de novo in the proband. Paternity testing was not performed. The p.His317Gln moderately conserved sequence change was predicted to be tolerated by in-silico tools. This variant was detected in one proband and her mother, both of whom had stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia levels of 5.8-6.1mmol/l and 6-6.3mmol/l respectively. However, the proband reported an HbA1c level of 5.2% which is below the expected range for GCK-MODY.","Discussion<SEP>Pathogenic variants in GCK represent the most common cause of MODY in the Registry, accounting for 57% of all MODY cases. This is consistent with other studies reporting a high prevalence of GCK-MODY as a percentage of all MODY patients (France, 56%; Italy, 41–61%; Spain, 25–80%; Czech Republic, 31%; Norway 12%, Chile, 50%). In this study, we identified 27 previously unreported GCK variants distributed throughout the gene with no particular variant associated with a more severe phenotype (Table 1). Their phenotype was similar to probands with pathogenic variants previously reported as causal for GCK-MODY. The main limitations of this study include incomplete clinical information, family history, and segregation studies which may have provided further evidence of pathogenicity.<SEP>Given the mild hyperglycemia and lack of associated complications, GCK-MODY can be considered a discrete genetic cause of mild hyperglycemia rather than a subtype of diabetes. Yet, there remains a significant clinical utility in making a correct diagnosis as patients with GCK-MODY do not require treatment except possibly in pregnancy. Our report of 22 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants will help to correctly diagnose other patients with these same variants. Moreover, our report of the 5 VUS will assist in future studies to determine the pathogenicity of these variants.<SEP>Conflicts of interest<SEP>All authors declare to have no conflicts of interest of any kind.<SEP>Contributions of the authors<SEP>May Sanyoura and Rochelle Naylor wrote the manuscript and participated in the discussion.

24804806,"The Mediterranean diet (MD) pattern has been associated with reduced CHD, cancer and overall mortality(  ). The MD is characterised by a relatively greater proportion of quantity and diversity of plant-derived foods (whole-grain cereals, raw and cooked vegetables, fresh and dried fruits, legumes and nuts), fish, a relatively moderate intake of meat and dairy products, with olive oil as the added fat, and a moderate intake of wine during meals(  ). Although different levels of adherence to the MD have been shown by country (with lower adherence in Northern Europe, medium in Central Europe and higher in Southern Europe among the countries included in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-InterAct study(  )), similar associations with CVD were observed across populations in different regions(  ). Despite some variation in findings(    ), the overall evidence from epidemiological and interventional studies suggests a beneficial effect of adherence to the MD on continuous metabolic traits of cardiovascular risk such as lipids and glycaemia(      ).<SEP>Recently, the potential importance of apolipoproteins in the prediction of cardiovascular risk has been appraised(    ), and an interventional study has recently reported an improvement in apolipoprotein profile (higher apoA-1, and lower apoB and apoB:A-1 ratio) among individuals in the MD intervention group compared with a control diet-supplemented group(  ). In addition to the potential beneficial effects of diet, it is now also acknowledged that genetic factors may influence the regulation of plasma lipids and glucose metabolism(    ), and that gene–diet interactions may help explain the variation in metabolic risk(  ). Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of SNP that may be associated with these traits(    ).<SEP>The rs780094 (G>A) SNP in the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) gene has been associated with higher TAG concentrations(    ). Conversely, the A allele has been associated with lower insulin levels, lower glucose levels and lower diabetes prevalence(        ). In a high cardiovascular risk Spanish population (PREDIMED-Valencia (PREvencion con DIeta MEDiterranea-Valencia) study), we have recently reported that a MD modulated the association of GCKR gene variation on TAG concentrations(  ). However, it is currently unknown whether such effects may apply in the general British population, and whether they apply to other lipids, apolipoproteins and glycaemic markers, and whether there is an interaction between genetic and dietary factors on these metabolic parameters.<SEP>Therefore, the objectives of the present study were (1) to assess the association between adherence to the MD and continuous metabolic traits related to lipids and glucose metabolism in a large population-based study, (2) to investigate the association of GCKR rs780094 (G>A) with TAG concentrations and other metabolic markers and (3) to examine the joint effects and interaction of MD adherence and genetic effects on the metabolic markers of lipids and glycaemia.","Subjects and methods<SEP>Study participants and design<SEP>The EPIC-Norfolk Study recruited 25 639 men and women, aged 40–79 years at baseline (1993–7), who were resident in and around Norwich, England. The present study has been described in detail previously(  ), and it was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving human participants were approved by the Norfolk District Health Authority Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Since the baseline health-check visit, there were three follow-up assessments including two postal questionnaires and a repeat health-check visit, but this cross-sectional analysis is based on the baseline visit. Health and lifestyle information was collected using a baseline questionnaire, which asked about the participants' personal and family health, demography, lifestyle (including diet and physical activity) and social status (education and occupation). A standardised health check was performed by trained nurses, including measurement of height (cm), weight (kg) and waist circumference (WC; cm) as described previously(  ). Non-fasting blood samples were collected. A detailed description of the storage method has been described previously(  ). Concentrations of serum lipids, total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and TAG concentrations were measured on an RA-1000 (Bayer Diagnostics). LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated using the Friedewald formula(  ); when serum TAG concentration exceeded 4·0 mmol/l, LDL-C concentration was not calculated. Concentrations of serum apoA-1 and apoB were measured using an Olympus AU640 Analyser (Olympus UK Limited). Measurement of glycated Hb (HbA1c) was added halfway through the baseline visit in 1995, and was available in approximately half of the cohort (n 10 780, with n 10 746 with HbA1c levels < 6·5 %). The level of HbA1c was measured with HPLC on a Bio-Rad Diamat (Bio-Rad).<SEP>We excluded the participants with missing baseline FFQ data or with ten missing FFQ lines as well as those with unavailable information on lipid measures. Thus, 20 986 participants from the baseline visit were eligible for inclusion in the present analysis.<SEP>Dietary assessment and Mediterranean Diet Score<SEP>Participants completed a validated 130-item semi-quantitative FFQ about their habitual diet in the past year(  ). For all food items, respondents were asked to report the frequency of consumption on a 9-point scale for a ‘medium serving’ from ‘never or once per month’ to ‘more than six times per day’. Amounts of energy and individual nutrient intake were calculated from the frequency and amount (medium serving size) of each food reported in the FFQ and converted into g/d by using in-house software, the Compositional Analyses from Frequency Estimates (CAFE) program(  ). The EPIC FFQ was validated against 16 d weighed food records (n 127)(  ).<SEP>Adherence to the MD was assessed by using the relative Mediterranean Diet Score (rMED)(    ), which is a variation of the original MD Score(  ). This variation consists mainly in the score criterion and in the olive oil component. Similarly to the MD Score, the rMED included nine nutritional components that are characteristic of the MD and included some presumed ‘beneficial’ components (vegetables, legumes, fruit and nuts, cereals, fish and seafood, olive oil (including olive oil consumption instead of the ratio of monounsaturated fat:saturated fat as in the original MD) and moderate alcohol consumption) and other presumed ‘detrimental’ components (meat and meat products and dairy products), as described previously(      ). While the original MD Score criteria assigned 1 point for intakes above the median among the study participants and 0 point for intakes below the median, with reversed scoring for meat and dairy intakes (score range 0–9), in the rMED, each component (apart from alcohol consumption) was calculated as a function of energy density (as g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), and was then divided into tertiles of intakes. We assigned a value of 0, 1 or 2 to the first, second and third tertiles, respectively, of the intakes of vegetables, legumes, fruit and nuts, cereals, and fish and seafood and positively scoring higher intakes for the beneficial components. The scoring was reversed for the two presumed detrimental components (meat and meat products and dairy products) by assigning a higher score for lower intakes. The scoring for olive oil was modified for the rMED(  ) because of the relatively large number of non-consumers. Therefore, 0 was assigned to non-consumers, 1 was assigned to participants with an intake below the median olive oil consumption (calculated only within olive oil consumers) and 2 was assigned to participants whose intake was equal to or above this median. For alcohol, a value of 2 was given to men with moderate alcohol consumption (intakes from 10 to 50 g/d), and a value of 0 was assigned otherwise, whereas for women, the corresponding cut-off points were 5 and 25 g/d. Therefore, the rMED ranged from 0 (indicating the lowest adherence to the MD) to 18 (indicating the highest adherence to the MD), which is different from the original MD Score that ranged between 0 and 9. Finally, the rMED was further classified into categories to reflect low (0–6 points), medium (7–10 points) or high (11–18 points) adherence to the MD on the basis of previously published cut-off points(  ).<SEP>Determination of genotypes<SEP>DNA for genotyping was extracted from EDTA whole-blood aliquots collected at the first and second health checks using phenol–chloroform extraction. The call rate was 99·5 %. There were 19 800 participants with available data on genotype (rs780094). We also included data on rs1260326 SNP (in high linkage disequilibrium with the rs780094 SNP; r 2 0·94) in a subset (n 7273), to replicate findings. Genotype distributions did not deviate from Hardy–Weinberg expectations (P= 0·14, rs780094 and P= 0·80, rs1260326).<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>Continuous variables were assessed for normality of distribution, and skewed variables were normalised by log10 transformation. Data are presented as means and standard deviations or geometric means and 95 % CI for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Baseline characteristics were described by rMED categories (low, medium and high). Differences in means among the groups were compared by using a one-factor ANOVA test, and comparisons of frequencies were conducted using the χ2 test. We fitted multiple linear regression models for the association between the rMED categories and continuous metabolic traits (TAG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, apoA-1, apoB and HbA1c) in the following way: model 1 adjusted for sex, age (in years, continuous). Model 2 additionally adjusted for potential confounders including physical activity (self-reported) that was derived into a four-scale index by combining levels of occupational and recreational physical activity(  ) (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active and active), smoking status (current smoker, former smoker and never smoker), total energy intake (EI, in kJ, continuous), lipid-lowering medication, social class (professional, managerial and technical, skilled non-manual, partly skilled and unskilled), and educational level (low education, O-level or equivalent to secondary school, A-level or equivalent including technical school, university degree or equivalent, including a higher vocational qualification). Model 3 additionally adjusted for BMI (continuous) and WC (continuous). We also examined the effects of per two-point increase in the rMED (as a continuous variable). The association between adherence to the MD and hypertriacylglycerolaemia status (defined according to the cut-off points ( ≥ 1·7 mmol TAG) was determined using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models. We performed sensitivity analyses by excluding participants with chronic prevalent disease (heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus and/or cancer) and excluding misreporters of energy. Misreporting of EI was estimated by using the ratio of reported EI:predicted BMR (EI:BMR). Participants were classified as under-reporters (EI:BMR < 1·14), plausible reporters (EI:BMR = 1·14–2·1) or over-reporters (EI:BMR>2·1) of EI by using cut-off points proposed by Goldberg(  ).<SEP>Among the 19 800 individuals with available data, we analysed the rs780094 SNP using a co-dominant mode of inheritance as in previous studies(      ). In multiple linear regression analysis, we adjusted for relevant covariates, with model 1 including age (continuous) and sex, and model 2 additionally including BMI and WC (both continuous) and use of lipid-lowering medication (no or yes). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the OR of hypertriacylglycerolaemia associated with the polymorphism.<SEP>Joint effects of genotype (GG, GA and AA) and rMED (low, medium and high adherence to the MD) on continuous metabolic traits were examined using ANCOVA with nine possible combinations (high adherence+GG, high adherence+GA, high adherence+AA, medium adherence+GG, medium adherence+GA, medium adherence+AA, low adherence+GG, low adherence+GA and low adherence+AA).<SEP>To examine the gene × MD adherence interaction on the levels of cardiometabolic markers (TAG, TC, apoB and HbA1c), we used multivariable linear regression models including main effects and interaction terms.<SEP>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 15.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc.). Statistical significance was set at the 0·05 level, and all tests were two-tailed. In addition, we also applied the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons, and set a lower statistical significance accounting for the number of tests of significance(  ).","Results<SEP>Among the 20 986 individuals, 33 % (n 6924), 51 % (n 10 627), and 16 % (n 3435) were in the low, medium and high MD adherence categories (rMED).<SEP>Overall, a higher adherence to the MD was observed among women, individuals with a lower BMI and WC, older, physically active people, and individuals with a higher level of education (Table 1). <SEP>Association between Mediterranean diet adherence and metabolic markers<SEP> Table 2 shows that TAG concentrations and the apoB:apoA-1 ratio in the medium and high categories of the rMED were significantly lower, while HDL-C and apoA-1 concentrations were higher compared with the concentrations in the lowest rMED category. Further mutual adjustment for other lipids subtypes did not alter the findings. HbA1c concentration was lower with an increasing rMED. After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, each of the concentrations of TAG, HDL-C and HbA1c remained significantly associated with the rMED. <SEP>Each two-point increment in the rMED was significantly inversely associated with TAG (β − 0·005, 95 % CI − 0·007, − 0·002), LDL-C (β − 0·001, 95 % CI − 0·003, 0·000), apoB:apoA-1 ratio (β − 0·002, 95 % CI − 0·005, 0·000) and HbA1c (β − 0·001, 95 % CI − 0·002, 0·000), while it was directly associated with HDL-C (β 0·004, 95 % CI 0·002, 0·005) and apoA-1 (β 0·006, 95 % CI 0·002, 0·009) (β coefficients for log-transformed variables). The rMED was inversely associated with hypertriacylglycerolaemia (TAG>1·7 mmol/l), with OR 0·89, 95 % CI 0·81, 0·98; model 3. Sensitivity analyses did not alter the main findings.<SEP>Association between glucokinase regulatory protein SNP and metabolic markers<SEP>Baseline characteristics according to the GCKR rs780094 SNP showed that no significant differences were observed in relation to age, sex, BMI, WC, social class and physical activity. Significant differences were found for educational level and lipid medication (see online Supplementary Table S1). The AA genotype (frequency 15·6 %) was associated with 0·16 mmol/l higher TAG concentrations compared with GG individuals in adjusted analyses (Table 3). The AA genotype was also significantly positively associated with TC and apoB, but no significant differences were found for other lipid parameters (HDL-C and apoA-1) by genotype (Table 3). We found a tendency towards lower HbA1c concentration for the A allele, but this was not statistically significant. Application of the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons did not alter these findings. Both GA and AA genotypes v. GG genotype were associated with a greater risk of hypertriacylglycerolaemia in adjusted analyses (GA: OR 1·23, 95 % CI 1·15, 1·33; AA: OR 1·47, 95 % CI 1·33, 1·62). <SEP>Joint results of genotype and Mediterranean diet adherence on metabolic markers<SEP> Table 4 demonstrates the joint results of genotype and MD adherence on metabolic parameters. Participants with the highest risk (AA genotype and with the lowest rMED) had 12·5 % higher TAG concentrations (mean 1·68 (95 % CI 1·63, 1·73) mmol/l) than those who had the lowest risk (mean 1·47 (95 % CI 1·45, 1·50) mmol/l; GG genotype with the highest rMED; Table 4). Similar results were found for TC concentrations (2·3 % higher) and apoB (3·1 % higher), respectively (Table 4). For HbA1c, the converse was the case with those who were GG homozygous with the lowest rMED having 3·3 % higher HbA1c concentration (Table 4). However, the association of MD adherence and metabolic markers did not differ significantly by genotype, with no significant gene–diet interactions for lipids or for HbA1c (TAG, P= 0·770; TC, P= 0·761; apoB, P= 0·860; HbA1c, P= 0·481). These findings were unchanged with correction for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. <SEP>Similar results were found when we analysed the rs1260326 SNP (in high linkage disequilibrium with the rs780094 SNP, r 2 0·94) in a small sample (n 7273; data not shown). Furthermore, we performed a subgroup analysis stratified by age ( < 59·1 years old v. >59·1 years old; cut-off points selected by median), physical activity (inactive or moderately inactive v. active or moderately active) and smoking status (smoker v. non-smoker) for the outcomes analysed in order to examine whether in any of these strata, a significant gene–diet interaction was obtained. We did not find any interaction, though there were differences by genotype in TAG levels in both strata for each of those three factors (data not shown).","Discussion<SEP>The findings from the present large population-based study in the UK suggest that higher adherence to the MD is associated with important metabolic benefits for lipid and glycaemic parameters, while the AA genotype of the GCKR rs780094 SNP is associated with an adverse distribution of lipid parameters. We also report that the TAG-raising A allele of rs780094 is associated with a trend towards a HbA1c-lowering effect. While there were significant differences in metabolic parameter distribution when comparing those with the highest and lowest risks (i.e. those with highest genetic susceptibility and lowest MD adherence v. those with lowest genetic susceptibility and highest MD adherence), the benefits of greater MD adherence were not differential by genotype.<SEP>The present study extends previous findings that were demonstrated for TAG concentrations and genotype in a high-cardiovascular risk Spanish population of 945 older adults(  ), to several metabolic parameters in a general British population in the EPIC-Norfolk study. The results of the present study indicate that a high adherence to the MD as defined by the rMED is associated with an improved metabolic profile (lower TAG concentrations, higher HDL-C concentrations and lower HbA1c levels). We provide evidence that the rs789004 SNP in the GCKR gene is associated with TAG concentrations, confirming previous findings(          ), and additionally report that carriers of the minor A allele also have higher TC and apoB concentrations. We further demonstrate that there are no gene–diet interactions on metabolic parameters, but that greater adherence to the MD confers a more favourable metabolic profile irrespective of genetic susceptibility.<SEP>The results of the present study are in general agreement with other cross-sectional, prospective and interventional studies of the association between MD adherence and markers of cardiometabolic risk(          ). However, although some studies have found inverse associations between MD adherence and TC(    ), we did not find such an association for TC. A weak association was shown for LDL-C when we considered rMED as continuous (per two points of increase in the rMED). These findings could be attributable to the differences in the definition of rMED in different studies. We also found an inverse association between the rMED and HbA1c levels, a finding that is in line with our recent report of an inverse association between adherence to the MD and incident diabetes(  ).<SEP>Thus far, the association between MD adherence and apolipoproteins has not been widely studied. Notably, we found a direct association of MD adherence with apoA-1 concentration, but this was of borderline significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, though it could be of potential clinical significance. This finding in a British general population is consistent with a randomised study in a high-cardiovascular risk Spanish population(  ). Our findings raise the possibility that MD adherence may be useful for achieving healthy apolipoprotein goals in the general British population, but require confirmation in future studies.<SEP>We confirmed the genetic association of the rare variant of the rs780094 SNP with higher TAG concentrations as described previously(      ). In the first study that identified this SNP in the GCKR gene as a target for TAG concentrations, this SNP was reported to explain 1 % of the residual variance in TAG levels(  ). In the present study, 0·5 % of the residual variance in TAG concentration is explained by this SNP, which is similar to that reported in Scandinavian samples (0·4–1·2 %)(  ) and higher than the variance reported in a French population (0·2 %)(  ). Past studies have found opposing associations of this SNP with TAG (elevated concentrations) and glucose (lowered concentrations)(          ). We have extended this finding by examining the association with HbA1c concentration, not previously reported in the literature, and we report that the TAG-raising A allele of rs780094 is associated with an HbA1c-lowering effect. A mutational mechanism for the reported association of this variant with raised TAG and lower glucose levels has been proposed, such that the GCKR T-allele Pro446Leu (C>T; rs1260326) has reduced regulation by physiological concentrations of phosphate esters fructose 6, resulting indirectly in increased glucokinase activity(  ). Altered glucokinase regulation in the liver is predicted to enhance glycolytic flux, promoting hepatic glucose metabolism and elevating concentrations of malonyl-CoA, a substrate for de novo lipogenesis, and thus relating to the reported association of this variant with raised TAG and lower glucose levels. Taken together, these data support an important role of GCKR in pathways regulating hepatic TAG as well as glucose metabolism in humans.<SEP>With respect to the study of genotype and other metabolic traits, we found an association between the rs780094 SNP and TC and apoB. Few studies have analysed other metabolic lipid or apolipoprotein traits in relation to this SNP(      ). Sparsø et al. (  ) found a modest association between rs780094 and TC, and interestingly, in agreement with Chasman et al. (  ), apoB concentrations are also higher in carriers of the risk allele in the present study.<SEP>Although no significant gene–diet interaction was found, this is the first study to examine how a SNP (rs780094) in the GCKR gene previously shown to be consistently associated with TAG concentrations is associated not only with TAG levels, but also with other cardiometabolic risk phenotypes (TC, apoB and HbA1c) according to the groups of adherence to the MD and genetic risk allele carriers.<SEP>The strengths of the present study include a large population-based sample size of approximately 20 000 individuals, and a well-phenotyped dataset that enabled us to account for a number of relevant plausible confounders and to estimate differences and interactions with a high degree of precision. A further strength is that we have extended previous findings from nutrigenetic studies that have focused on associations between single diet or nutrient components and endpoints to examine dietary patterns by assessing the rMED score of MD adherence. The analysis of dietary patterns may provide a more accurate depiction of peoples' eating habits and yield better models for generating public health recommendations regarding healthy eating(  ). Limitations of the present study include the cross-sectional design of the study that does not allow temporal relationships to be examined. The FFQ for dietary assessment is prone to measurement error, and its use at a single time point in the present study does not permit the examination of any changes in diet over time, notwithstanding, the EPIC-Norfolk FFQ is a validated instrument(  ). We had non-fasted samples in the present study, due to logistical issues relating to recruiting participants to a large epidemiological study. However, for glycaemia, we used HbA1c levels, where fasting is not required, and we do not believe that the absence of fasted lipid samples affects our overall findings and interpretation, in keeping with recent evidence(    ).<SEP>In conclusion, the present study provides evidence on the potential protective properties of the MD, evaluated as an a priori-defined score, on the markers of cardiometabolic risk, and confirms the association of genetic variation in GCKR with TAG concentrations, adding new information on its association with other lipids and apolipoproteins. The finding of both separate and joint associations of diet and genotype, but not an interaction between them, with the metabolic profile should be further investigated in other populations and in prospective studies.",25295,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
31208162,"What is already known on this topic?<SEP>Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare inherited disease characterized by unregulated insulin secretion and profound hypoglycemia. There are few reports pertaining to patients with CHI from south China.<SEP>What this study adds?<SEP>This is the first study investigating the clinical features, molecular genetic characteristics and treatment, including the optimal therapeutic approach, in patients with CHI in south China.<SEP>Introduction<SEP>Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is the most frequent cause of persistent hypoglycaemia in neonates and infants. CHI occurs due to the dysregulated and inappropriate secretion of insulin from pancreatic β cells. The incidence of CHI is estimated to be 1 in 40,000-50,000 live births in northern Europe and 1 in 2,500 births in Saudi Arabia. There are no nationwide data regarding the incidence of this disorder in China.<SEP>Inappropriate insulin secretion can suppress the production of ketone bodies, which serve as an alternative fuel during hypoglycemia. The lack of glucose and the deprivation of alternative fuels for the brain will increase the risk of brain damage in these patients. To date, mutations in 14 different genes, namely ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, SLC16A1, UCP2, HNF1A , HNF4A , HK1 , PGM1, PMM2, CACNA1D , and FOXA2 , that lead to dysregulated secretion of insulin have been described. The most common forms of CHI are due to defects in ABCC8 and KCNJ11, which encode the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel subunits of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) protein and inwardly rectify potassium channel (Kir6.2) proteins, respectively. Both these genes are located on chromosome 11p15.1.<SEP>The clinical presentation can be varied, ranging from completely asymptomatic to mild or severe disease that is unresponsive to medication and requires surgical intervention. Diazoxide is the first-line agent for the treatment of CHI. Diazoxide binds to the SUR1 subunits and opens the KATP channel, thereby preventing depolarization of the β-cell membrane and insulin secretion. If necessary, those who are unresponsive to medical therapy may undergo surgical treatment. Histologically, CHI is divided into three subgroups. These are the diffuse, focal and atypical forms of CHI. Children with diffuse CHI may require a near-total pancreatectomy which carries the attendant risk of diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, whereas the focal form will only require a limited, focal lesionectomy. Conventional radiological imaging is often used but is unable to distinguish between the two forms. 18F-DOPA positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning is an accurate and non-invasive technique to differentiate focal and diffuse types of CHI. Unfortunately, this imaging method is not available in southern mainland China. Genetic analysis may provide important diagnostic clues, particularly in the absence of specific imaging modalities, during the investigation of CHI cases. Children with the diffuse form of CHI due to recessive mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 usually do not respond to diazoxide. Focal forms are sporadic and associated with a paternally inherited mutation in ABCC8/ KCNJ11 genes.<SEP>Although the clinical characteristics and genetic aetiology of CHI patients have been described in some studies in China, little is known about CHI in southern China. We first reported our experiences with the management of CHI in 12 children in 2009.<SEP>The objectives of the current study were to investigate the clinical presentation and molecular genetic characteristics of a group of patients with CHI in southern China and also to explore the most appropriate therapeutic approaches.","Methods<SEP>Subjects<SEP>Enrolled patients included those diagnosed with CHI who were hospitalized in the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center from November 2012 to June 2017. Most of the patients with CHI came from the Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan and Hainan provinces of southern China. Serum ammonia levels were checked in all cases. All infants and children were diagnosed with CHI based on clinical and biochemical criteria which were as follows: whether serum insulin was simultaneously detectable (>2 mU/l) concurrent with hypoglycaemia (blood glucose <2.6 mmol/l); along with evidence of elevated glucose requirements (glucose infusion >8 mg/kg/min) in the absence of ketosis or ketonuria; and an inappropriate glycaemic response to glucagon injection at the time of hypoglycaemia. Patients with a secondary cause of hypoglycaemia such as perinatal asphyxia, prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction, maternal diabetes and syndromic forms were excluded. Being responsive to diazoxide was defined as maintaining blood glucose above 3.5 mmol/l after a short period of fasting which varied depending on the age of the patient: 4 hours in neonates; 8 hours in infants; and 12 hours in children. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center (2016022210).<SEP>Genetic Analysis<SEP>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes, using a kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All exons and intron-exon boundaries of the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, purified and sequenced. The sequences were analysed and compared to the wild-type published reference sequences (NM_000525 for KCNJ11 and NM_000352.3 for ABCC8) using Chromas software (Technelysium Pty Ltd, South Brisbane, Australia). The GLUD1 gene was sequenced in patients with hyperammonaemia (HA), whereas GCK gene sequencing was subsequently performed in those patients with no mutation identified in the ABCC8, KCNJ11 or GLUD1 genes. The novelty of mutation sites were determined by searching the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar). All variations were identified in this study using the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP) and the 1000 Genomes Project database (https://www.internationalgenome.org/1000-genomes-project-publications). Intronic variants were analysed with GenSCAN (http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html). To test the pathogenicity of novel missense mutations, Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen, http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph) and Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/) were used.<SEP>Treatment and Follow-up<SEP>Neonatal history, clinical presentation, treatment and complications were analysed in the CHI patients. Intravenous glucose infusion to maintain blood glucose levels of >2.8 mmol/l, nutritional therapy and diazoxide treatment were initiated immediately upon diagnosis. Nutritional therapy included frequent meals enriched with complex carbohydrates and nasogastric feeds at midnight. A glucose polymer, maltodextrin (Malt Extract, Wakodo, Asahi Group Foods, Ltd., Japan), was utilized in infants younger than six months of age. Subjects older than six months were given supplemental uncooked corn starch through a nasogastric tube between meals, before bedtime and for night-time feeds. Diagnostic tests for protein-sensitive hypoglycemia were performed in five patients with HI/HA syndrome. The blood glucose concentrations of all five patients decreased following the protein load and an age-adjusted daily diet consisting of a protein combination with fat and carbohydrate was started.<SEP>Diazoxide was started in a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. When diazoxide treatment was effective, the dosage was reduced to the effective minimum. Oral hydrochlorothiazide (1-2 mg/kg/day) was used in conjunction with diazoxide to counteract the fluid-retaining properties of diazoxide. All patients treated with diazoxide were carefully monitored for fluid and sodium retention. In three children who were not responsive to diazoxide, octreotide (5-25 µg/kg/day) injections were administered.<SEP>Pancreatectomy was implemented in patients not responding to medical therapy. Clinical follow-up was initiated one month after hospital discharge and continued at intervals of three months subsequently. Self-monitored blood glucose levels were recorded. Brain damage was evaluated by a pediatric neurologist at the time of diagnosis and at each three monthly follow-up.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>The results were analysed using the SPSS 17.0 program (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA) and were expressed as the mean±standard error of the mean (mean±SE) and in percentages (%). The Student’s t-test and the Wilcoxon test were used for statistical analysis of the data. All p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.","Results<SEP>A total of 65 patients (47 males and 18 females) with a diagnosis of CHI were included in the study. Age at diagnosis ranged from immediately following birth to seven years old. Twenty-three patients (35.4%) were macrosomic and their mean birth weight was 3,690 g. Sixty-two patients were born at term. The CHI symptoms were first noted during the neonatal period in 29 patients (44.6%), during the infancy period (1-12 months) in 26 patients (40%) and during childhood (>12 months) in 10 patients (15.4%).<SEP>Of the 65 patients, 13 were diazoxide-unresponsive, 40 patients were diazoxide-responsive and 12 received dietary treatment only. Patients were divided into two groups based on diazoxide responsiveness; Group 1, diazoxide-unresponsive and Group 2, responsive to diazoxide or dietary treatment. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of the patients in the two groups are presented in Table 1. Age at onset of CHI was significantly different between these two groups. The neonatal form comprised 92.3% of Group 1, but only 32.7% of Group 2. There was a significantly higher incidence of epilepsy in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p<0.05). The time between symptom manifestation and diagnosis ranged from one day to six years, and the duration was again significantly longer in Group 2. A patient (Case 61) in Group 2 was six years old and was initially misdiagnosed as having a seizure disorder before the hypoglycemia was detected.<SEP>In our study, ABCC8 mutations were identified in 16 children (25% of the cohort), and no KCNJ11 mutations were identified on KATP channel gene mutation analysis. Five patients with persistent HA had mutations in GLUD1 (Figure 1). No variants were found in the GCK gene. Fifteen different ABCC8 mutations were discovered, five mutations were compound heterozygous, 11 were heterozygous and none were homozygous (Table 2). Among the children who carried compound heterozygous mutations, diazoxide treatment was effective in three children. Treatment was not effective in one child and one child was regulated with diet.<SEP>The most common mutation was a deletion/insertion mutation c.3224-3226delACC ins CAGCCAGGAACTG (p.Thr1042GlnfsX75) found in five unrelated patients, which possibly represents a relatively common mutation in southern China. Five novel ABCC8 mutations (p.Phe5SerfsX72, p.Gln273ArgfsX85, p.Leu724del, p.Asp1447Gly and IVS 25-1G>T) were identified. Of the novel mutations, two were frameshift mutations, one was a deletion mutation, one was a missense mutation and one was a splice site mutation. In accordance with the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), two variants were perceived as “pathogenic” and three variants were predicted as “likely pathogenic”. A novel heterozygous variant in ABCC8 gene was identified in case 22. The patient has now been on therapy with diazoxide for more than one year at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day with normal growth and development. In one case (patient 59), two novel mutations were identified. This girl was macrosomic at birth. Hypoglycemia was first detected on day three after birth at a local hospital, and improved with frequent feedings. However, her parents did not monitor her blood glucose. She was admitted to our hospital at age 14 months for brief generalized convulsive periods. Laboratory tests revealed hypoglycemia (blood glucose: 2.5 mmol/L) HI (plasma insulin level: 5.9 µIU/mL) when she had an episode. Four hourly daytime feeds (solids and cow’s milk) and four hourly uncooked cornstarch (1.6 g/kg) could maintain the blood glucose above 3.5 mmol/L. During six months follow-up, there was no episodes of hypoglycemia. However, she had sustained hypoglycaemic brain injury with global developmental delay.<SEP>In this study, 16 parents underwent genetic analysis. Five patients (patients 1, 5, 10, 14 and 18) had paternally inherited monoallelic mutations. Of the five patients, three were diazoxide-unresponsive and two were diazoxide-responsive. In the three diazoxide-unresponsive patients (patients 1, 5 and 10), diffuse pancreatic disease was confirmed following surgery. One patient (patient 3) had two heterozygous mutations: one missense mutation c.314A>C (p.His105Pro) in exon 3, inherited from his father and a nonsense mutation c.2800C>T (p.Gln934X) in exon 23 inherited from his mother. He was diazoxide-unresponsive, which had been previously reported. The 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan indicated a focal lesion in the head of the pancreas, whereas the histology of the resected pancreas showed atypical form. The enlargement of pancreatic β-cell nuclei were distributed mainly in the head but included the body and tail of the pancreas. The abnormal active endocrine cells were not restricted to a focal lesion nor were they present throughout the entire pancreas.<SEP>The GLUD1 gene was detected in patients with hypoglycaemia, HI and mild HA. Three different heterozygous mutations in the GLUD1 gene were identified in five patients. The p.Arg322 His mutation was found in patients 54, 55 and 56. Patients 55 and 56 were sisters. The mutation was autosomal and dominantly inherited from their father, who was an asymptomatic carrier. The p.Ser498Leu mutation was found in patient 52 and the p.Asn463Asp mutation in patient 53. All mutations have been previously reported in patients with HI/HA. The serum ammonia concentration of this group of patients was 85-184 µmol/l. After a confirmation of the diagnosis of HI/HA syndrome due to a GLUD1 genetic defect, the patients were started on a low-protein diet (1.5 g/kg/day of natural protein intake). Three patients (patients 54, 55 and 56) were successfully managed by diet alone. They have had no further hypoglycaemic episodes. The other two patients were responsive to diazoxide treatment.<SEP>Of 65 patients, 40 (61.5%) achieved long-term stable glycaemic control by diazoxide alone. Octreotide was administered to three children who were not responsive to diazoxide. Among these three patients, two were unresponsive to octreotide, and one patient discontinued this drug due to severe diarrhoea. Side effects of the diazoxide treatment were observed in 32 (80%) patients. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, severe gastrointestinal upset and poor appetite occurred in 69%. Six patients were fed through a nasogastric tube because of severe gastrointestinal reactions and their blood glucose levels were kept relatively stable. Different degrees of hypertrichosis occurred in 55% (22/40) of patients during clinical follow-up. In one case (patient 43), effective diazoxide therapy had to be stopped because of thrombocytopenic purpura.<SEP>Pancreatectomy was performed in 10 patients who were unresponsive to drugs. Nine patients were treated with subtotal pancreatectomy, and one patient underwent pancreatectomy twice. In patient 3, a second resection of the pancreas was required because of sustained hypoglycaemia. Histological examination of the resected pancreatic tissue confirmed diffuse disease in nine patients and atypical form in one patient. One patient (patient 7) who underwent surgery at two months of age developed diabetes mellitus at five years of age and was treated with insulin. Case 8 developed diabetes mellitus immediately after surgery and required insulin treatment. Two cases still had mild hypoglycaemia after surgery; one (patient 4) was successfully managed with regular daytime and overnight feedings and the other (patient 9) was treated with diazoxide. Only one case had symptoms of malabsorption.<SEP>Diazoxide treatment was stopped in 14 of patients (35%), between the ages of six months and four years, and no recurrence of hypoglycaemia was observed. Eight patients with subtotal resection were able to maintain normal blood glucose and HbA1c levels during the duration of follow-up. There were three diazoxide-unresponsive patients: one patient died of multiorgan failure and two patients abandoned the treatment and died of severe hypoglycemia after three to seven days at home.","Discussion<SEP>In this study, the clinical characteristics, laboratory data and genetic features of 65 patients with CHI, the largest CHI cohort from southern China, were reported. Until now, there have been no nationwide data regarding this disorder in China, although several studies have summarized the clinical and genetic characteristics of CHI in northern and eastern China.<SEP>In our cohort of patients with CHI, 32.8% were noted to have disease-causing mutations: 16 (25%) patients were positive for ABCC8 mutations; five (7.8%) were positive for GLUD1 mutations; and 44 (67%) were negative for GCK, GLUD1, ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutations in the gene analysis. No mutations were found in the KCNJ11 gene in this study. As described in previous studies, most of the mutations identified have been detected in the KATP channel. The mutation detection rates of ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes reported by Kapoor et al and by Snider et al were 36.3% (109/300) and 69% (288/417), respectively. However, in a similar study conducted in a large group in Turkey, it was found that the mutation rate in the ABCC8/KCNJ11 genes was 17/35 (48.6%). The pick-up rate in our cohort (16/65, 25%) for ABCC8 and KCNJ11 gene variants is lower than those in previous reports and also differed from recent studies in China, which reported mutation rates of approximately 44% (12/27) and 67.6% (25/32). Accordingly, the low mutation discovery rate in our study may be due to the differences in genetic background among most of the cases from southern China. In our study, we found the deletion/insertion mutation c.3224-3226delACC ins CAGCCAGGAACTG in five patients, which may be the most common mutation leading to CHI in the southern Chinese population. These findings suggest that a geographical distribution difference may exist in the mutational spectrum of the ABCC8 gene in the Chinese population. This mutation causes a frameshift and introduces a premature stop codon 75 codons downstream of the mutation, leading to the loss of the functional domain NBD2. Five patients in this study carried compound heterozygous mutations. It was previously demonstrated that harboring compound heterozygous mutations of ABCC8 gene was usually associated with medically unresponsive CHI. However, in this cohort, treatment with diazoxide was effective in three patients and one patient could be regulated with diet alone. Dekel et al reported that some compound heterozygous mutations may cause milder HI which is responsive to diazoxide. Kumaran et al also reported a case of transient hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia due to a compound heterozygous mutation in ABCC8. The mechanisms responsible for this clinical variability may be related to background genetic factors and other unknown factors involved in regulating gene expression.<SEP>Five novel mutations were found in the ABCC8 gene in five patients. One patient (patient 59) was a compound heterozygote with two novel deletion mutations, P.Gln273ArgfsX85 and P.Leu724del, and dietary treatment alone achieved stable glycaemic control in this patient.<SEP>Current medical management for CHI includes diazoxide combined with chlorothiazide as the first-line therapy. Diazoxide binds to the SUR1 subunit of the KATP channel and reduces insulin secretion by hyperpolarisation of the pancreatic β-cell plasma membrane. After diagnosis, a therapeutic trial with diazoxide was performed immediately. In our cohort, 40 (61.5%) CHI patients were diazoxide-responsive. Similar to our results, Kapoor et al recently reported that 64% of their cohort responded to diazoxide treatment. In the cohort reported by Şıklar and Berberoğlu, 71% (100/141) of Turkish patients with CHI were responsive to diazoxide treatment. The recommended dosage of diazoxide is 5-15 mg/kg/day and the effective dosage of diazoxide is believed to always be lower than 15 mg/kg/day. In our study, the initial dosage of diazoxide was 10 mg/kg/day and the minimal effective dosage was sought to maintain the stability of blood glucose. If the patient was unresponsive to a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day of diazoxide, further increasing the dosage did not improve the effect but rather increased the risk of serious complications. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, nausea and poor appetite, were common if dosages higher than 10 mg/kg/day were administered. One patient receiving effective diazoxide therapy had to stop treatment due to serious gastrointestinal symptoms and three cases required nasogastric tube feeding. To improve the effectiveness and reduce side effects, we believe that diazoxide should be used at the minimal effective dosage.<SEP>In this study, 35 of 65 patients developed mild mental retardation including four patients associated with HI/HA syndrome. Both low blood glucose and insufficient treatment increased the risk of impairment in neurodevelopment in CHI. HI/HA syndrome is caused by activating mutations in the GLUD1 gene, which encodes the intramitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). The epilepsy and developmental problems in HI/HA syndrome are thought to be a result of recurrent hypoglycaemia, chronic HA or decreased brain concentrations of the neurotransmitter GABA, due to increased GDH activity. The high rate of developmental delay in this study is likely to be due to the delayed diagnosis. Given that the clinical symptoms of this disease were not specific, and their HI may be less severe, more infants with CHI were misdiagnosed and not recognized until they presented with hypoglycaemic seizures, weeks to months later. The earlier determination of blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations will be helpful for diagnosis. Therefore, all neonates, infants and children should be evaluated for hypoglycaemia.<SEP>Dietary treatment is an important aspect of care for all patients with CHI. In our study, 18% of patients could achieve glycaemic stability with dietary treatment alone. Frequent feedings and specific diets include the provision of adequate carbohydrates to maintain normoglycaemia. The good response to dietary treatment obtained in some cases indicates that this should be the initial treatment for all CHI patients in addition to a trial of diazoxide. To increase the carbohydrate content, glucose polymer and uncooked corn starch were added to the diet of the older infants. Some infants may require a nasogastric tube for regular and frequent feedings. Patients with HI/HA syndrome require a protein-restricted diet. Feeding problems such as difficulty with sucking, swallowing, vomiting and food refusal occur in a significant proportion of children with CHI and continuous feeding through nasogastric tube or gastrostomy may be required.<SEP>A pancreatectomy was implemented in 10 diazoxide-unresponsive CHI patients, accounting for 15.4% of the whole cohort. During surgery, none of our patients were found to have a focal lesion. A pathological examination of pancreatic tissues revealed the diffuse form of HI in nine of 10 cases.<SEP>Our findings were similar to those reported by Bellanné-Chantelot et al (58.7%; 64/109) and Li et al (89.5%). In total, 40% (4/10) of patients with CHI unresponsive to diazoxide had ABCC8 mutations. In these four patients with the diffuse form of CHI proved by histology, three cases carried a single heterozygous ABCC8 mutation and one case carried a compound heterozygous mutation. A segregation analysis of both parents in these cases showed that the mutation was paternally inherited in three patients and biparentally inherited in one patient. CHI with a single paternally inherited heterozygous mutation in the ABCC8 gene has been previously reported to suggest focal disease. However, Chandran et al reported that heterozygous paternal mutations may also cause diffuse CHI. Paternal mutations causing diffuse disease may act via a different mechanism from that of recessive mutations.<SEP>Study Limitations<SEP>Our study has limitations. Firstly, our research is a single-center study and cross-sectional design. Future multicentre studies are necessary to obtain the long-term follow-up characteristics of such patients at the national level. Secondly, other genes associated with CHI were not tested in this study. A targeted gene panel for CHI or whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis could be applied in these patients in the future.",25332,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
23557707,"Ketone bodies (KBs) serve as an important alternative source of energy in the fasting state. The circulating levels of KBs in the blood are determined by the balance of their rates of production (ketogenesis) and utilization (ketolysis). Ketogenesis includes the conversion of free fatty acids (FFAs) into two major KBs, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc). KBs undergo ketolysis in the extrahepatic tissues producing energy.<SEP>Ketogenesis takes place in the liver and is accelerated by elevated concentrations of FFAs released from the adipose tissue, which is the major source of KBs. Insulin plays a central role in the regulation of KB levels. Low levels of insulin increase the rate of ketogenesis, and high levels of insulin suppress the rate of ketogenesis. Elevated insulin levels induce KB clearance via increased KB metabolism in extrahepatic tissues. Insulin-resistant obese individuals have a similar sensitivity for insulin-mediated suppression of ketogenesis as do lean individuals. Insulin also inhibits ketogenesis by preventing the breakdown of triglycerides into FFAs and glycerol.<SEP>The circulating levels of KBs vary between individuals with normal and abnormal glucose tolerance. In diabetic ketoacidosis attributable to low insulin secretion, KB levels are very high, whereas in people with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), the levels of KBs are usually low. Several small studies have found that levels of KBs are relatively high in patients with type 2 diabetes, but it is not known how KBs vary across the entire range of glucose tolerance. Infusion of KBs into fasting dogs induced hypoglycemia, but when hyperglycemia (9–10 mmol/L) was established by the constant infusion of glucose, AcAc and BHB promoted hyperglycemia. Thus, the effects of KBs on glucose metabolism seem to depend on the fasting state and on glucose levels. The underlying mechanisms by which KBs regulate glycemia remain unclear. Conflicting evidence has been published on the association of KBs with insulin sensitivity as elevated KB levels have been associated with insulin resistance in some studies and insulin sensitivity in others. Similarly, KBs have stimulated acute insulin secretion in some studies, whereas other studies report increased KB levels associated with decreased insulin secretion. Furthermore, very little is known with regards to the genetic variants regulating KB metabolism.<SEP>The purpose of our study was to investigate 1) the association of KB levels with fasting and 2-h glucose levels across the entire range of glucose tolerance, 2) the association of KB levels with insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, 3) the role of KB levels as predictors of the worsening of hyperglycemia or type 2 diabetes, 4) the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) regulating glucose levels or type 2 diabetes with KB levels, and 5) the association of adipose tissue mRNA expression of genes involved in KB metabolism with insulin sensitivity.","RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS<SEP>Subjects.<SEP>The study included 9,398 nondiabetic or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic men from the population-based Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study. The study protocol has been previously explained. Glucose tolerance was classified according to the American Diabetes Association criteria. Among participants, 3,034 (32.3%) had NGT, 4,344 (46.2%) had isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), 312 (3.3%) had isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), 1,059 (11.3%) had both IFG and IGT, and 649 (6.9%) had a new type 2 diabetes. Individuals with previously diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes were excluded, and none of the participants were on antidiabetic medication.<SEP>Nondiabetic subjects (n = 4,335) from the original METSIM cohort of 10,197 men have been reexamined (mean follow-up time of 5 years); 4,059 were nondiabetic and 276 had new type 2 diabetes at follow-up. Characteristics of the subjects included in the baseline and follow-up studies are given in Supplementary Table 1. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. All study participants gave written informed consent.<SEP>Anthropometric measurements.<SEP>Height, weight, hip, and waist circumference were measured as previously described. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared.<SEP>Oral glucose tolerance test.<SEP>A 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (75 g of glucose) was performed, and samples for plasma glucose and insulin were drawn at 0, 30, and 120 min.<SEP>Laboratory measurements.<SEP>Plasma glucose was measured by enzymatic hexokinase photometric assay (Konelab Systems Reagents; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Vantaa, Finland). Insulin was determined by immunoassay (ADVIA Centaur Insulin IRI no. 02230141; Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to measure fasting AcAc and BHB levels (mmol/L) in serum samples (the mean storage time of 2.5 years). NMR methods have been previously described in detail. The fasting serum samples collected at the baseline study were stored at −80°C and thawed overnight in a refrigerator prior to sample preparation. Aliquots of each sample (300 μL) were mixed with 300 μL sodium phosphate buffer.<SEP>Calculations.<SEP>The trapezoidal method was used to calculate the glucose and insulin areas under the curve (AUCs) in an oral glucose tolerance test based on samples collected at 0, 30, and 120 min. Evaluation of insulin sensitivity (Matsuda ISI) and insulin secretion (InsAUC0–30/GlucAUC0–30) has been previously described.<SEP>Genotyping.<SEP>Genotyping of 62 SNPs associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia was primarily based on Illumina HumanExome-12v1_A Beadchip, which includes 247,870 markers focusing on protein-altering variants selected from >12,000 exome and genome sequences representing multiple ethnicities and complex traits, as previously described in detail. SNPs that were not available from the exome array were genotyped using either the Applied Biosystems TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay (rs10423928, rs231362) or Sequenom iPlex Gold SBE assay (rs12779790, rs10811661, rs1111875, rs2612067, rs2283228, rs10923931, and rs10010131). TaqMan genotyping call rate was 100% and discordance rate was 0% among 4.5% DNA samples genotyped in duplicate. Sequenom iPlex call rate was >96.9% and discordance rate was 0% among 4.2% DNA samples genotyped in duplicate in METSIM study participants. The concordance rates between genotyping methods were as follows: Sequenom vs. Taqman 99.3% (based on >10,000 genotype comparisons), Sequenom vs. ExomeChip 99.5% (based on >30,000 genotype comparisons), and Taqman vs. ExomeChip 99.3% (based on >100,000 genotype comparisons). All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the significance level corrected for multiple testing by the Bonferroni method (P < 0.0012).<SEP>Gene expression analysis.<SEP>Subcutaneous fat biopsy samples (n = 200) were obtained from a random sample of the participants of the METSIM baseline study (age 55.6 ± 4.9 years; BMI 26.6 ± 3.3 kg/m2). Total RNA was isolated from these samples using Qiagen miRNeasy Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity number values were assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. High-quality samples (RNA integrity number >7.0) were used for transcriptional profiling with the Illumina Human HT-12 v3 Expression BeadChip. Genome Studio software (2010.v3) was used to obtain fluorescent intensities. The HT-12 BeadChip contains 48,804 expression and 786 control probes. Expression data from 19,306 probes were removed because of 1) failure of the probe to align to a genomic or transcriptomic location, 2) alignment of the probe to multiple genomic or transcriptomic locations, or 3) presence of SNPs in the probe sequence that may affect hybridization efficiency as determined by the methodology developed by Barbosa-Morais et al.. The remaining 29,497 probes were processed using nonparametric background correction, followed by quantile normalization with control and expression probes using the neqc function in the limma package (R v2.13.0). The 16,223 probes with detection P values <0.01 in any of the 200 samples were used for further analysis. Gene expression data have been deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number GSE32512.<SEP>Statistical analysis.<SEP>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 19 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). All traits except age were log-transformed to correct for their skewed distributions. We used the linear regression model to evaluate fasting KBs as predictors for glucose AUC at 5-year follow-up. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between KBs and incident type 2 diabetes. Quintiles of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion across the categories of glucose tolerance were compared with the ANOVA (P < 0.0125 was considered as statistically significant given four tests for two KBs and two glucose tolerance categories). Unstandardized effect sizes (B [SE]) per copy of the risk alleles of the SNPs investigated were estimated by linear regression analysis using untransformed dependent variables, and percentage of B from the mean values of KBs was calculated. After the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (for 124 tests given the 62 SNPs and two traits), P < 4.0 ×10−4 was considered as statistically significant. For both AcAc and BHB, we had ≥80% power to detect changes (P < 0.05) in the mean trait values from 0.76 to 4.47% per one copy of the risk allele (risk allele frequencies ranging from 0.05 to 0.5). We correlated adipose tissue mRNA expression of major enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of KBs (KEGG pathway hsa00072) with insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion (Supplementary Fig. 1). In total, there were nine enzymes in the pathway, namely, ACAT1, ACAT2, OXCT1, OXCT2, BDH1, BDH2, HMGCS1, HMGCS2, and HMGCL. Additionally, the genes encoding the enzymes CPT1A and CPT2 involved in the fatty acid metabolism (KEGG pathway hsa00071) and ACSS2 gene encoding the enzyme involved in the activation of acetate to acetyl-coA were included. Among these genes, expression data were either not available or filtered for ACAT2, OXCT2, BDH2, and HMGCL.","RESULTS<SEP>Levels of KBs across the categories of glucose tolerance.<SEP>We evaluated the association of AcAc and BHB in nondiabetic individuals and individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG) categories (Fig. 1). FPG ≤5.4 mmol/L and 2hPG ≤5.9 mmol/L were set as the reference categories. In the FPG category, AcAc levels decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in individuals with IFG by −2% (95% CI −4 to −0) and increased significantly (P < 0.01) in individuals with newly detected diabetes by +64% (+16 to +109), as compared with the reference category. BHB level decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in subjects with IFG by −5% (−7 to −3) and increased significantly (P < 0.01) in the diabetic range by +99% (+6 to +186). In the 2hPG category, AcAc level increased significantly (P < 0.01) in subjects with IGT by +21% (+13 to +28) as well as in newly diagnosed diabetes by +29% (+16 to +42), as compared with the reference category. BHB level increased nominally in IGT (P < 0.05) by +12% (+4 to +20) and in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (P < 0.01) by +52% (+23 to +79), as compared with the reference category. Fasting AcAc and BHB levels correlated significantly with FPG (r = −0.051, P = 1.9 × 10−6, and r = −0.065, P = 1.4 × 10−9, respectively) and 2hPG levels (r = 0.079, P = 1.4 × 10−13, and r = 0.042, P = 9.2 × 10−5, respectively).<SEP>KBs and the risk of hyperglycemia and incident diabetes.<SEP>Follow-up data of 4,335 participants were available from the ongoing prospective METSIM 5-year follow-up study. A total of 276 participants developed incident diabetes between the baseline and follow-up studies (follow-up of 5 years). Most of the participants who developed new diabetes on the basis of FPG level (62 of 70 participants) had their FPG in the range of 7.0–7.5 mmol/L, and most of the participants who developed new diabetes on the basis of 2hPG had their 2hPG level (52 of 80 participants) in the range of 11.1–12.0 mmol/L. AcAc and BHB levels adjusted for confounding factors known to increase the risk of diabetes (age, BMI, smoking, and physical activity) predicted an increase in glucose AUC evaluated as a continuous variable at follow-up (P = 2.3 × 10−4 and P = 5.7 × 10−6, respectively), and quite similar results were obtained for the comparison of the highest quartile of glucose AUC versus the three lowest quartiles of glucose AUC (P = 7.9 × 10−8 and P = 3.4 × 10−6, respectively) (Table 1). After further adjustment for baseline glucose AUC, the associations lost their statistical significance. The highest quartile of AcAc adjusted for age, BMI, smoking, and physical activity predicted conversion to type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.32 [95% CI 1.00–1.74], P = 0.047) (Table 2), and also after further adjustment for FPG (OR 1.41 [1.06–1.89], P = 0.019). Adjustment for 2hPG, instead of FPG, abolished statistical significance (P = 0.423). When analyzed in glucose tolerance categories, AcAc predicted incident diabetes in individuals with IFG (OR 1.49 [1.12–1.99], P = 0.007) after the adjustment for confounding factors.<SEP>Additional adjustment for insulin sensitivity strengthened the association of KBs with development of hyperglycemia and conversion to type 2 diabetes, whereas insulin secretion weakened/abolished these associations (Supplementary Table 2).<SEP>Levels of KBs across the quintiles of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.<SEP>To study the mechanisms by which KBs could be linked to hyperglycemia, we investigated their association with insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. The levels of AcAc and BHB increased significantly (P < 0.01) in the highest quintile of Matsuda ISI up to 29 and 41%, respectively (Fig. 2). AcAc and BHB levels decreased significantly (P < 0.01) by −23 and −29%, respectively, in the highest quintile of insulin secretion (adjusted for insulin sensitivity) compared with the lowest quintile. In a multivariate linear regression model including insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion as independent variables, insulin sensitivity remained inversely associated with AcAc (P < 1.0 × 10−19) and BHB levels (P < 1.0 × 10−22).<SEP>Association of risk SNPs for type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia with the levels of KBs.<SEP>Associations of 62 risk SNPs for type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia with KB levels are shown in Table 3. After correction for multiple testing (threshold of statistical significance, P < 4.0 × 10−4), the glucose-increasing C allele of rs780094 of GCKR showed a significant association with elevated levels of BHB (effect size +5.6% per the C allele, P = 3.7 × 10−6 after adjusting for age and BMI) and a nominally significant association with AcAc (+3.9%, P = 0.003). Additionally, there were nominally significant associations for SNPs of FADS1, ANK1, GIPR, HMGA2, and SLC2A2 with the levels of AcAc or BHB or both (Table 3).<SEP>Gene expression of genes involved in KB metabolism.<SEP>Correlations of adipose tissue mRNA expression with the most important genes regulating FFA oxidation, ketogenesis, and ketolysis are shown in Table 4. Pearson correlation of fasting FFAs with AcAc was 0.483 (P < 0.001) and with BHB was 0.443 (P < 0.001) in nondiabetic METSIM participants, and therefore genes regulating FFA metabolism were included in statistical analyses. Adipose tissue mRNA expression of the gene encoding CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) was positively correlated with glucose AUC and inversely with Matsuda ISI. This enzyme regulates the binding of carnitine to long-chain fatty acids, allowing them to be transported to the mitochondria for FFA oxidation. Expression of genes regulating ketogenesis, HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1, soluble) and HMGCS2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2, mitochondrial), did not correlate significantly with glucose AUC, insulin sensitivity, or insulin secretion. In contrast, significant correlations were found with adipose tissue mRNA expression levels of several genes associated with ketolysis with glucose metabolism parameters. Of these genes, ACAT1 expression had the most significant correlations with glucose AUC (r = −0.314, P = 6.1 × 10−6), Matsuda ISI (r = 0.479, P = 7.1 × 10−13), and insulin secretion (r = −0.444, P = 7.0 × 10−11). ACAT1 encodes acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1, an enzyme responsible for the last step in KB breakdown where two molecules of acetyl-CoA are generated from acetoacetyl-CoA (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, expression of other genes regulating ketolysis, BDH1 (BHB dehydrogenase, type 1), OXCT1 (3-oxoacid CoA transferase 1), and ACSS2 (acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2), was inversely correlated with glucose AUC and insulin secretion and positively correlated with Matsuda ISI. Adipose tissue mRNA expression of ketolysis genes did not correlate with the levels of KBs (all correlations <0.10, P = NS).","DISCUSSION<SEP>In this population-based cross-sectional study of 9,398 men with prospective 5-year follow-up data on 4,335 men, we evaluated the relationship between the levels of KBs and hyperglycemia, the levels of KBs as risk markers for incident type 2 diabetes, and the mechanisms explaining these associations. Our study reports several novel findings: 1) KB levels increased in participants with IGT and type 2 diabetes at baseline, 2) KBs predicted the worsening of hyperglycemia and incident type 2 diabetes in a 5-year follow-up, 3) the association of KBs with the worsening of hyperglycemia was attributable to impaired insulin secretion, and not to insulin resistance, 4) of the 62 risk variants for type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia, the glucose-increasing major C allele of rs780094 of GCKR was associated significantly with elevated BHB levels, and 5) adipocyte RNA expression of several key enzymes involved in ketolysis correlated inversely with glycemia and insulin secretion and positively with insulin sensitivity.<SEP>KBs and hyperglycemia.<SEP>High levels of KBs have been observed in individuals with diabetes, but there is no previous information about KB levels in the nondiabetic glucose range. In our study, the levels of AcAc and BHB were slightly decreased in subjects with IFG, but increased in the diabetic range (FPG ≥9.0 mmol/L) up to 64 and 99%, respectively. In contrast, in the 2-h glucose categories, the levels of AcAc and BHB were already somewhat increased in subjects with NGT and IGT, and significantly increased up to 29 and 52%, respectively, in individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes (2hPG ≥13 mmol/L). Thus, our study provides clear evidence that high levels of KBs are not only indicators of diabetic hyperglycemia but also markers of disturbed glucose metabolism in the prediabetic state.<SEP>We also observed that the levels of AcAc and BHB predicted an increase in glucose AUC in nondiabetic individuals, but the associations were abolished after the adjustment for glucose AUC at baseline. This could indicate an important link between the levels of KBs and glucose metabolism, but on the other hand, the clinical importance of KBs as markers for the worsening of hyperglycemia might be limited. AcAc, but not BHB, predicted the development of new type 2 diabetes during a prospective 5-year follow-up of the METSIM cohort, independent of known risk factors for type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose level at baseline. The reasons why KBs predicted very significantly the worsening of glycemia, but not so clearly incident diabetes, are FPG and 2hPG levels at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, which were often only marginally elevated (FPG in the range of 7.0–7.5 mmol/L and 2hPG in the range of 11.1–12.0 mmol/L), whereas the levels of KBs were significantly increased at higher glucose levels (FPG levels exceeding 8.0 mmol/L and 2hPG levels exceeding 12.0 mmol/L) (Fig. 1). Our results suggest that fasting AcAc could be a new marker for the development of incident diabetes. It is of interest to note that a recent study identified α-hydroxybutyrate, an organic acid derived from α-ketobutyrate, as a biomarker of insulin sensitivity in subjects with NGT.<SEP>To study the mechanisms by which KBs can increase the risk of hyperglycemia, we investigated the association of KB levels with insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Surprisingly, we found that high levels of KBs were associated with high insulin sensitivity in the nondiabetic glucose range at baseline, similar to recent findings in young Finnish adults. Furthermore, insulin sensitivity was significantly correlated with the key enzymes of ketolysis (Table 4), which suggests that in insulin-sensitive individuals, KBs are rapidly converted to acetyl-CoA, which stimulates oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial generation of ATP. Based on these findings, it is not likely that insulin resistance is an important mechanism in the prediction of hyperglycemia by elevated KB levels. This was clearly demonstrated by our 5-year follow-up data that showed that adjustment for Matsuda ISI did not weaken the association of KBs with the development of hyperglycemia. In contrast, impaired insulin secretion substantially weakened or abolished the association of KBs with the development of hyperglycemia and the conversion to type 2 diabetes. These findings emphasize the crucial role of impaired insulin secretion as a regulator of hyperglycemic effects of KBs. Adequate insulin secretion relative to insulin sensitivity maintains low levels of KBs by suppressing the expression of hormone-sensitive lipase and thus prevents the release of FFAs from adipose tissue, which is the major source of hepatic ketogenesis and high circulating levels of KBs.<SEP>Risk SNPs for hyperglycemia or type 2 diabetes and their association with the levels of KBs.<SEP>The association of KB levels with hyperglycemia prompted us to investigate the role of risk SNPs for type 2 diabetes and hyperglycemia in KB metabolism. Of the 62 SNPs analyzed, only the glucose-increasing major C allele of rs780094 of GCKR (encoding glucokinase regulatory protein) was significantly associated with increased BHB levels and nominally associated with AcAc levels. Glucokinase is the principal component in sensing the glucose level and plays a vital role in whole-body glucose homeostasis, and its activity is regulated by GCKR in the liver. The C allele of rs780094 of GCKR has been previously reported to be associated with fasting glycemia, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, decreased levels of total and VLDL triglycerides, decreased levels of alanine and isoleucine, and elevated levels of glutamine. The association of rs780094 with KB levels adds further to the pleiotropy of the multiple effects of GCKR.<SEP>There were several nominally significant associations of different SNPs of ANK1, GIPR, HMGA2, SLC2A2, and FADS1 with KB levels. However, these associations did not have a consistent pattern (increase/decrease or associations with AcAc or BHB or both), and therefore these results need to be replicated in other population-based studies before making conclusions on the implications of these findings.<SEP>Limitations.<SEP>Our study included only middle-aged Finnish men, and the applicability of these results to women or to other ethnic and racial groups remains unknown. Although our cohort included >9,000 men, the power of our study to demonstrate significant associations of KBs with SNPs regulating glucose levels or the risk of type 2 diabetes is limited.<SEP>In conclusion, our large population-based study of 9,398 men shows that elevated levels of KBs associate with fasting and 2-h glucose and predict the worsening of glycemia and incident type 2 diabetes. Impaired insulin secretion, but not insulin resistance, explained these findings. The major C allele of rs780094 of GCKR, which is known to increase glycemia, significantly associated with KB levels.<SEP>This article contains Supplementary Data online at http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db12-1363/-/DC1.",24510,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
25768928,"Introduction<SEP>The risk of cardiometabolic diseases, the world’s leading cause of mortality, is higher in people with elevated levels of systemic inflammation, independent of traditional cardiometabolic risk factors. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), as a measurement of systemic inflammation, are associated with hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, peripheral artery disease, and mortality. Although observational data suggest a link between CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes, Mendelian randomization approaches have provided evidence against a causal link between CRP and these cardiometabolic phenotypes.<SEP>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with inflammatory markers including CRP and different cardiometabolic phenotypes including T2D, coronary artery disease (CAD), lipids and hypertension. From these GWAS we already learned that several genes, such as IL6R, APOC1, GCKR and HNF1A, are associated both with systemic inflammation and cardiometabolic phenotypes such as CAD, lipids and diabetes. This phenomenon of one genetic locus affecting more than one phenotype is called genetic “pleiotropy”. In general, two types of pleiotropy can be defined. As previously defined by Solovieff et al., “biological pleiotropy” refers to a gene that has independent biological effects on more than one phenotype, and “mediated pleiotropy” refers to the situation where the genetic effect on phenotype B is mediated by phenotype A that is causally related to phenotype B. Although both types of pleiotropy are interesting, only biological pleiotropy refers to the genuine pleiotropy where the effect of the genetic variant on two or more phenotypes is independent.<SEP>We hypothesize that in addition to reverse causation, genetic loci with pleiotropic effects may underlie the association between CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes. To this end, we applied a simple and robust approach to point out these pleiotropic genetic variants. First, we examined whether common variants identified for cardiometabolic phenotypes are associated with serum CRP levels as a measure of systemic inflammation. Second, we conversely examined whether variants so far identified for serum CRP associate with cardiometabolic phenotypes. In addition, we adjusted the association between the SNP and CRP for the cardiometabolic phenotypes and vice versa to distinguish a genuine biological pleiotropic effect from mediated pleiotropy.","Materials and Methods<SEP>Study design<SEP>To examine the overlap between genes for inflammation and cardio-metabolic disorders we collected GWAS meta-analyses data from published GWAS on cardiometabolic phenotypes and CRP. These GWAS are mainly conducted in individuals from European ancestry (Table 1). We tested the genetic association of cardiometabolic SNPs with systemic inflammation using the largest published GWAS meta-analysis on CRP levels from the CHARGE (the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) inflammation working group. Testing the genetic association of the CRP SNPs with 10 cardiometabolic phenotypes we used the recent GWAS data from the following consortia: Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus the Coronary Artery Disease, CARDIoGRAMplusC4D, International Consortium for Blood Pressure, ICBP, the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium, MAGIC, DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis, DIAGRAM, The Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits, GIANT and Global Lipids Genetic Consortium, GLGC. Additionally, we carried out analyses in a population based cohort study to explore the type of pleiotropy of the overlapping SNPs.<SEP>Cardiometabolic SNPs and association with CRP<SEP>We first compiled a list of genome-wide significant SNPs (p-value < 5×10-8) previously identified in large GWAS on cardiometabolic traits to test the genetic association in the CRP GWAS. The following cardiometabolic traits were included to generate the SNP list: coronary artery disease (51 SNPs in CARDIOGRAMplusC4D, n = 130,681 with 63,746 cases); blood pressure (29 SNPs in ICBP, n = 69,395); fasting glucose, fasting insulin (53 SNPs in MAGIC, n = 133,010); type 2 diabetes (55 SNPs in DIAGRAM, n = 149,821 with 34,840 cases); body-mass index (38 SNPs in GIANT, n = 123,865); LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol (102 loci in GLGC, n = 100,184). When the SNP was not available in the CRP GWAS, we searched for a proxy with an r 2 > 0.8. For 6 SNPs, this was not possible. LD-based pruning was performed (r2 threshold of 0.3) using HapMap LD information to make sure that independent SNPs were included in the analysis. The SNP with the lowest p-value in one of the cardiometabolic GWAS was chosen. The final list included 283 independent SNPs that are genome-wide significantly associated with one or more cardiometabolic phenotypes.<SEP>CRP SNPs and association with cardiometabolic phenotypes<SEP>We used the publically available GWAS meta-analyses data to test whether any of the 18 independent genome-wide significant SNPs identified in the CRP GWAS were associated with the following cardiometabolic phenotypes: LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol (GLGC); body mass index (GIANT); systolic blood pressure (ICBP); coronary artery disease (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium); fasting glucose and fasting insulin (MAGIC); type 2 diabetes (DIAGRAM). All available GWASs provided p-values for all 18 CRP SNPs, except the GWAS on CAD and the glycemic phenotypes which were based on a custom chip array (Metabochip array) containing 79,000 SNPs and this array did not include 8 of the CRP SNPs. For the SNPs that were not on the Metabochip, we used for fasting glucose and fasting insulin the previous GWAS published by Dupuis et al., for type 2 diabetes only the stage 1 GWAS including all HapMap SNPs and for CAD we used the summary data from the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis only.<SEP>CRP and cardiometabolic measures<SEP>Coronary artery diseases was defined in the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium using standard criteria for myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease namely symptoms of angina pectoris, previous myocardial infarction or cardiac intervention. Hypertension was defined in the ICBP consortium as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg. Fasting glucose and fasting insulin were measured in MAGIC using standard laboratory techniques. Type 2 diabetes was in the DIAGRAM consortium defined as fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/l or non-fasting glucose plasma level ≥ 11.0 mmol/l and/or treatment with oral antidiabetic medication or insulin. LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol were measured in the GLGC using standard laboratory techniques.<SEP>We used the discovery panel of the recently published GWAS meta-analysis on serum CRP (CHARGE Inflammation). The meta-analysis included 15 studies in the discovery panel (n = 65,000). CRP was natural log-transformed (lnCRP) and effects represented a 1-unit change in lnCRP per copy increase in risk allele.<SEP>Statistical methods<SEP>In this study we evaluated 463 possible SNP-phenotype associations including 283 independent cardiometabolic SNPs in the CRP GWAS and 18 independent CRP SNPs in 10 different cardiometabolic GWAS. To address the issue of multiple testing we used a Bonferroni corrected alpha of 1.1×10-4 (0.05/463 tests) as a robust threshold for a significant association between the SNP and the phenotype in our study.<SEP>In a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot, a nominal probability distribution is compared against an empirical distribution. In the scenario that the nominal p-values form a straight line on a Q-Q plot when they are plotted against the empirical distribution, all relations are null. When the observed distribution is deflected to the left from the uniform null distribution, lower p-values are observed compared to that expected by chance (enrichment). We used QQ-plots to evaluate whether SNPs that are genome-wide significant associated with the cardiometabolic phenotype, were in the CRP GWAS distributed differently from what is expected under the null-hypothesis. Vice versa, we evaluated whether genes identified for CRP were in the cardiometabolic GWAS distributed differently from what is expected under the null-hypothesis. We used Fisher’s combined probability test to test for significant enrichment in the QQ-plots.<SEP>Evaluation of the type of pleiotropy<SEP>To clarify the type of genetic pleiotropy (biological or mediated), we performed additional analyses in the Women’s Genome Health Study (WGHS) including 23,294 women. In the first model, we analyzed the age-adjusted association between CRP (dependent variable) and the lead SNP for CRP in the pleiotropic regions. To examine whether the association is independent of cardiometabolic traits we further adjusted this association for BMI, lipid levels (HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol) and HbA1C. We used HbA1C as a proxy for glycemic metabolism given the fact that glycated hemoglobin is an acceptable marker of average blood glucose level in the last 2–3 months. In addition, we adjusted the association for age and in a stepwise manner we added lipids, BMI and HbA1C to the model to evaluate the different effects of the phenotypes on the association. Last, we analyzed the association between the pleiotropic SNP and the associated cardiometabolic phenotypes unadjusted and adjusted for CRP. As we tested 43 SNP-phenotype associations in the WGHS, we used a Bonferroni corrected alpha of 1.2×10-03 as a threshold of study-wide significance. All regression analyses were carried out in the statistical software R version 2.15.3.<SEP>Women’s Genome Health Study (WGHS)<SEP>The WGHS is a prospective cohort of female North American health care professionals representing participants in the Women’s Health Study who provided a blood sample at baseline and consent for blood-based analyses. Participants were 45 or older at enrollment and free of cardiovascular disease, cancer or other major chronic illness. The current data are derived from 23,294 WGHS participants with whole genome genetic data and verified self-reported, European ancestry. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Boston, MA, USA). All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study.<SEP>Covariates WGHS<SEP>BMI (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was calculated from responses to the baseline questionnaire. All baseline blood samples underwent measurement for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) via a validated immunoturbidometric method (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan). Concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) and HDL-C were measured enzymatically on a Hitachi 911 autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics) with day-to-day reproducibility of 1.36% and 1.07% for TC concentrations of 129.8 and 277.2 mg/dL, respectively, (throughout this report, concentrations and units given are those reported in the referenced sources) and of 1.98% and 2.68% for HDL-C concentrations of 35 and 55 mg/dL, respectively. LDL-C was determined directly (Genzyme) with reproducibility of 2.16% and 1.98% for concentrations of 76.2 and 148.7 mg/dL, respectively. Triglycerides were measured enzymatically, with correction for endogenous glycerol, using a Hitachi 917 analyzer and reagents and calibrators from Roche Diagnostics; reproducibility was 1.52% and 1.49% for triglyceride concentrations of 82.5 and 178.8 mg/dL, respectively. Hemoglobin A1c was measured using turbidimetric immunoinhibition directly from packed red blood cells (Roche Diagnostics) with reproducibility of 3.63% and 3.77% at levels of 5.2% and 8.8%, respectively. A total of 22,773 participants with genotyped and covariates available were included in this study.<SEP>Genotyping WGHS<SEP>DNA extracted from the baseline blood samples underwent SNP genotyping via the Illumina Infinium II assay for querying of a genome-wide set of SNPs from the Illumina HumanHap300 Duo “+” platform. This panel including the standard content of approximately 318,237 SNPs covering the entire genome from the HumanHap300 panel with an additional focused panel of 45,571 SNPs selected to enhance coverage of cardiovascular candidate genes and SNPs with suspected functional consequences. For the current analysis, all samples had successful genotype information for >98% of the SNPs, while all SNPs had successful genotype information for >90% of the samples. SNPs with significance p <10-6 for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were excluded from analysis. Self-reported European ancestry was confirmed in the 23,294 samples on the basis of a principal component analysis using PLINK among 1,443 ancestry informative SNPs selected for Fst >0.4 in the HapMap2. In total, 339,875 genotyped SNPs passing the criteria for inclusion also had minor allele frequency at least 1 percent. On the basis of linkage disequilibrium relationships in the HapMap (release 22), genotypes for a total of 2,621,896 SNPs were imputed from the 23,294 samples passing the quality criteria using Mach v. 1.0.16.<SEP>Pathway analysis<SEP>Pathway analysis was performed on the pleiotropic loci that we identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software tool (IPA Ingenuity Systems). The Ingenuity Knowledge Base (including only genes) was used as a reference set and we considered molecules and/or direct and indirect relationships. The confidence filter was set to experimentally observed or high (predicted). Pathways were generated with a maximum size of 35 genes and we allowed up to 25 pathways. The significance p-value associated with enrichment of pathways was calculated using the right-tailed Fisher’s exact test, considering the number of query molecules that participate in that pathway and the total number of molecules that are known to be associated with that pathway in the reference set. A False Discovery Rate of five percent was used as a threshold of significance using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.","Results<SEP>Cardiometabolic SNPs in CRP GWAS<SEP>First, we used QQ-plots to evaluate whether the p-values for the associations of the 283 cardiometabolic SNPs with serum CRP are distributed differently from what is expected under the null hypothesis in each trait group. As depicted in Fig. 1, the leftward deviation of the dotted lines in the QQ-plots shows that the 283 SNPs known for cardiometabolic phenotypes to have p-values smaller than expected under the null hypothesis in the CRP GWAS (p-value: 7.2×10-306).<SEP>A total of 19 SNPs out of 283 independent cardiometabolic SNPs (6.7%) were associated with CRP after correction for multiple testing (p-value threshold 1.1×10-04). These 19 SNPs were located within or close to 12 different genes APOC1, HNF1A, GCKR, IL6R, PPP1R3B, HNF4A, PABPC4, BCL7B, FTO, TMEM18, PLTP and MC4R. Table 2 shows the SNPs with the lowest p-values in the 12 pleiotropic loci based on the CRP GWAS, i.e. the lowest p-value in that genomic locus. The eight SNPs in Table 2 with the lowest p-value were already known to be associated with CRP based on the recent CRP GWAS. The next four SNPs were not identified in the genome-wide association study of CRP. The first novel association was rs1558902 with a p-value of 2.2×10-6. This SNP is located in the first intron of the FTO gene on chromosome 16. The second novel signal was the SNP rs2867125 which is located on chromosome 2, near 46kb downstream of TMEM18. This SNP had a p-value of 5.0×10-6 in the CRP meta-analysis. The third association was with rs6065906 which is located on chromosome 20, near the PLTP and PCIF1 gene (p-value = 6.7×10-6). The last finding was rs571312 which is located 2 Mb upstream of the MC4R gene on chromosome 18 (p-value = 3.8×10-5).<SEP>Among the associated SNPs, we observed many SNPs with different directions of effect on the cardiometabolic phenotypes and CRP than one would expect based on the association of CRP and these phenotypes in observational data. As an example, the A-allele of the SNP rs4420638 in the APOC1 locus increases serum CRP levels. However, this allele is associated with a decrease in the level of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. We also observed such effects for the G-allele of the SNP rs1183910 in the HNF1A locus. This allele increases serum CRP levels and is associated with a decline in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.<SEP>Out of the 12 pleiotropic loci, 6 loci had the same lead SNP in both the CRP and one or more of the cardiometabolic GWAS. In the other 6 loci the lead SNPs were different between the CRP GWAS and the cardiometabolic GWAS. However, in the majority of these loci the lead SNPs of the cardiometabolic GWAS were in high LD (r 2 > 0.8) with the lead SNP in the CRP GWAS. In the IL6R locus we observed the lowest LD between the top hit in the CRP GWAS and the CAD GWAS (r 2 = 0.52).<SEP>CRP SNPs in cardiometabolic GWAS<SEP>We used the same QQ-plots as described previously to evaluate whether the association p-values for the 18 CRP SNPs are distributed differently from what is expected under the null hypothesis in the different cardiometabolic GWAS. As depicted by the leftward deviation of the dotted lines in the QQ-plots for CAD (p = 1.4×10-09), the cholesterol phenotypes (HDL-cholesterol, p = 6.4×10-69; LDL-cholesterol, p = 2.9×10-166; total cholesterol, p = 3.6×10-169 and triglycerides, p = 2.5×10-196) and the glycemic phenotypes (fasting glucose, p = 2.4×10-12 and fasting insulin 5.5×10-04), the p-values for the association between the 18 CRP SNPs and these phenotypes are significantly smaller than expected under the null hypothesis (Fig. 2). We did not observe such a significant deviation in the QQ-plots of BMI (p = 0.18) and SBP (p = 0.06).<SEP>Results of the association of the 18 genome-wide significant associations with CRP-level are depicted in Fig. 3 (S1 and S2 tables). We observed 9 associations with one or more of the 10 cardiometabolic phenotypes close to or within the genes APOC1, HNF1A, IL6R, GCKR, IL1F10, PPP1R3B, HNF4A, PABPC and BCL7B (p-value < 1.1×10-4). Only 1 gene (IL1F10) was not identified in the previous analysis where we tested the association between the cardiometabolic SNPs and CRP. Among all 9 associations, we found three associations that are not reported in the GWAS for that specific phenotype. The first was rs1183910 with CAD (p-value 5.6×10-6). This SNP is located in the first intron of the HNF1A gene on chromosome 12. The second was rs6734238 with total cholesterol (p-value 1.16×10-5). This SNP is located on chromosome 2, nearby the IL1F10 gene and other interleukin 1 family genes. The third was rs4420638 with T2D (p-value 4.0x10-6) nearby the APOC1 gene on chromosome 19.<SEP>Comparable with the previous associations results, we observed many different direction of effects. For instance, the A-allele of the SNP rs4420638 in the APOC1 locus increases serum CRP levels and is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the G-allele of the SNP rs1183910 in the HNF1A locus increases serum CRP levels and is associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease.<SEP>Exploring the type of pleiotropy<SEP>We observed a total number of 13 genetic regions with pleiotropic effects on CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes: 12 regions identified in the first step testing the cardiometabolic SNPs with CRP and 1 additional region identified in the second step testing the associations of the CRP SNPs with the cardiometabolic phenotypes. Table 3 shows the unadjusted and adjusted associations between the 13 overlapping SNPs and CRP-level using individual level data from the WGHS. There was no significant association in the WGHS between the SNPs located near PLTP and MC4R and CRP after correction for multiple testing. The effect sizes of the genetic loci in or near the genes APOC1, HNF1A, IL6R, PPP1R3B, HNF4A and IL1F10 did not diminish substantially after adjustment for BMI, cholesterol levels and HbA1C suggesting biological pleiotropy. For BCL7B, FTO and TMEM18 the effect sizes decreased considerably implying mediated pleiotropy. The estimate of the association between rs1260326 (GCKR) and CRP decreased substantially after adjustment but was still strongly associated. We observed the same scenario for the association between rs4660293 (PABPC4) and CRP. When we added the phenotypes in a stepwise manner to the model, we observed for the mediated pleiotropic loci FTO and TMEM18 that the effect was mainly mediated through BMI (S3 Table). For BCL7B and PABPC4, lipids appeared to be the most important mediators. Fig. 4 shows graphically the biological and mediated pleiotropic effects.<SEP>The results for the associations between the pleiotropic SNPs and the associated cardiometabolic phenotypes are presented in S4 Table. Eight SNPs were not significantly associated with the cardiometabolic phenotype in the WGHS after adjustment for multiple testing. The majority of the estimates in- or decreased slightly after adjustment for CRP. However, the estimates between APOC1 and HbA1C, PABPC4 and triglycerides and BCL7B and HDL-cholesterol decreased considerably after the adjustment for CRP.<SEP>Pathway analysis<SEP>The results from the pathway analysis including all 13 pleiotropic genes are listed in the S5 Table. A total number of 13 canonical pathways were significantly enriched using an FDR of five percent. The top pathways included the FXR/RXR activation (p = 7.4×10-09), LXR/RXR activation (p = 4.6×10-05), Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) signaling (p = 7.6×10-05), hepatic cholestasis (p = 1.1×10-04) and acute phase response signaling (p = 1.3×10-04).","Discussion<SEP>We observed several overlapping common genetic risk factors for cardiometabolic phenotypes and systemic inflammation. The additional analyses provided evidence for six biological pleiotropic loci with independent effects on both CRP and the cardiometabolic phenotype. These pleiotropic loci suggest a shared genetic background for CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes. In addition, 5 pleiotropic loci appeared to have an effect on CRP mediated through the cardiometabolic phenotypes. Taken together, our results highlight the complex shared genetic architecture of cardiometabolic phenotypes and chronic inflammation.<SEP>Several of the identified biological pleiotropic loci suggest that the association between CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes is not only reverse causation, but also shared independent genetic effects. Both the HNF1A and HNF4A loci were associated with CRP after adjustment for the cardiometabolic phenotypes. The effect directions were the same for type 2 diabetes and CRP, implying people carrying the risk allele for type 2 diabetes also have higher CRP values. We observed this also for the PPP1R3B locus where people carrying the risk allele for higher cholesterol also experience higher CRP levels. In both cases the effect on CRP is independent of the effect on the corresponding cardiometabolic trait.<SEP>Three of the associations that were not reported in the GWAS on CRP-level (FTO, TMEM18 and MC4R) are associations with SNPs discovered in the GWAS on BMI by Speliotes et al.. Moreover, these SNPs were also the leading findings in this large BMI GWAS meta-analysis. Our additional analyses clearly showed that after adjustment for BMI, the effects of FTO and TMEM18 decreased substantially, resulting in a non-significant association, which suggests that their effect on inflammation is indeed mediated by BMI. This is in line with previous research that already provided evidence for a causal role of BMI in inflammation. Conversely, none of the SNPs identified in the CRP GWAS were associated with BMI when we tested these SNPs in the BMI GWAS.<SEP>Our results also suggest a role for lipids in systemic inflammation. When we adjusted the association between BCL7B loci and CRP for the cardiometabolic phenotypes including lipids, the association was not present anymore. This locus appears to increase systemic inflammation through their effect on lipids. Also the association between PABPC4 and CRP decreased after adjustment for CRP, but there was a significant residuals effect suggesting partly mediated effects through lipids. The observation that lipids may cause inflammation is in line with previous studies that have shown an important role for oxidized LDL-cholesterol molecules and free fatty acids in the development of systemic inflammation. However, in addition to the mediated pleiotropic loci among lipids and CRP, we also observed loci with independent effects (biological pleiotropy) on lipids and CRP including APOC1, HNF1A and HNF4A, highlighting the complex interrelationship of lipids and inflammation. Moreover, the pathway analysis confirmed the role of the pleiotropic genes in both inflammation and lipid metabolism.<SEP>We observed little overlap between risk loci for CAD and CRP. Apart from the IL6R gene, our results suggest an association with CAD at the HNF1A locus. The HNF1A gene is an important hepatic nuclear transcription factor that has been associated in GWAS with lipids and diabetes. This gene is known to regulate many target genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport. A previous study has associated this locus with different cardiovascular phenotypes including coronary artery calcification and incident CHD. Unfortunately we were not able to look-up 9 CRP SNPs in the larger CAD Metabochip GWAS because these variants were not on the Metabochip and no appropriate proxies were available. This might partly explain the little overlap between CRP and CAD genetic risk variants.<SEP>In the additional analyses we used glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) to adjust for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, T2D and other components of the glucose homeostasis. HbA1C represents the average glucose level in the last 3 months, implying that this is only a proxy for the complex glucose homeostasis rather than a covariate that reflects its entire biological metabolism. Therefore, there may still be residual confounding from other biological pathways that have an effect on glucose and insulin levels. This could explain the observed residual effect of GCKR on CRP after adjustment for the cardiometabolic phenotypes.<SEP>In the evaluation of the type of pleiotropy, we adjusted the association between the pleiotropic SNP and CRP for the cardiometabolic phenotypes. For some variants we observed a convincing attenuation in the effect estimates (BCL7B, FTO and TMEM18). For other variants, the attenuation was less pronounced (GCKR and PABPC4). From these results we cannot conclude whether the residual effect is residual confounding or a true residual effect. Additionally, for several variants the effect estimates were the same or even increased after adjustment suggesting biological pleiotropy. The latter increase in estimate might be due to negative confounding where the SNP has an opposite direction of effect on the cross-associated phenotype compared to CRP and the effect of this phenotype on CRP is in the same direction (negative confounding). We also analyzed the association between the pleiotropic SNP and the cardiometabolic phenotypes unadjusted and adjusted for CRP. Although there is ample of evidence against a causal role for CRP in the development of cardiometabolic phenotypes, for some associations the effect estimates attenuated considerably. This might be explained by the fact that CRP is correlated with many intermediate phenotypes that mediate the association between the SNP and the cardiometabolic phenotype.<SEP>Among some pleiotropic SNPs we observed opposite direction of effects on the phenotypes than one would expect based on their effects on the health of the possessor and the association of CRP and these cardiometabolic phenotypes in observational data. This phenomenon is known as “antagonistic pleiotropy”. For instance, the SNP in the HNF1A locus increases serum CRP level according to the G allele and decreases LDL-cholesterol level. For biological pleiotropic loci we can substantiate this antagonistic effect. A genetic locus may have a deleterious effect on one phenotype, but an independent beneficial effect on a second phenotype. An explanation for these findings might be the fact that the effect sizes and variances explained by the genetic variants are small and therefore they only play a minor role in the phenotypical correlations. Moreover, the high frequency of seemingly detrimental alleles in human populations may partly be the effect of antagonistic pleiotropy. As expected, among the loci where no independent effect was observed (mediated pleiotropy), we did not observe antagonistic pleiotropy.<SEP>Our study has certain strengths. We used the largest available GWAS data on lipids, blood pressure, BMI, CAD, glycemic traits, T2D and CRP from the GLGC, ICBP, GIANT, CARDIoGRAMplusC4D, MAGIC, DIAGRAM and CHARGE Inflammation consortia to attain as much power as possible. By including only genome-wide significant findings, we restricted the analysis to the most robust genetic associations. Moreover, we used a conservative method to correct for multiple testing, lowering the probability of false positive findings. Nonetheless, some limitations should be acknowledged. Although we used the largest available GWAS sample sizes, the identified common genetic variants for above mentioned phenotypes only explain a modest fraction of the genetic variance of these phenotypes (ranging from 5 to 12 percent). Therefore, the effects of the cardiometabolic SNPs on CRP and vice-versa may still be too small to detect cross-phenotype associations, resulting in an underestimation of the amount of genetic overlap. Moreover, we only focused on common SNPs and it might be that also rare variants underlie the shared genetic associations. The method we applied to distinguish “biological” from “mediated” pleiotropy is a classical and widely used approach in the field of epidemiology. However, we cannot completely rule out reverse causation or unknown confounders as potential drivers of the association between the genetic variant and CRP. Furthermore, we only studied GWAS including participants of European ancestry. We are aware of differences in haplotype structures between different ethnicities; however, the results are likely to be generalizable given the biological pathways.<SEP>In conclusion, we observed several genetic loci with independent effects on both CRP and one or more cardiometabolic phenotypes. These results suggest that the association between CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes is partly explained by a shared genetic background.",31004,['OBWCCE']
22844323,"1. Introduction<SEP>Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is a common disease with a high prevalence ranging from 1 to 5 percent in large autopsy studies. Rupture of IAs causes approximately 75% of all subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) cases and most ruptured IAs present with SAH. SAH remains a critical condition, with only 25% of victims living independently. Inflammation was firstly suggested to occur in IAs by Virchow in 1847, and further evidence came from the 1930s when Maass described round cell infiltration, most likely lymphocytes that have been regularly detected in immunohistochemical studies of the IA wall are associated with IA rupture. In experimental IA in rodents, macrophage infiltration goes after IA formation and endothelial dysfunction. The role of inflammation in the formation and progression of aneurysm has not been well investigated, but there was considerable circumstantial evidence linking inflammation to IA. <SEP>Both environmental and genetic factors are involved in the etiology of IA. Several studies have revealed candidate genes in different populations. Indeed, there is a three- to fivefold increased risk for first-degree relatives of affected individuals, compared with the general population. The TP53 gene has an important function in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and maintenance of DNA integrity. The importance of p53 in cell cycle regulation and DNA integrity is such that it has been called the “guardian of the genome”. TP53, located on chromosome 17p13 is 19 kb in size and consists of 11 exons resulting in a transcript of 2629 bp and a protein of 393 amino acids. Codon 72 (Arg72Pro) in exon 4 of the TP53 gene is a frequent functional SNP that leads to a methionine proline conversion. The TP53 Arg72Pro SNP results in a change in its protein structure reflected by its altered electrophoretic mobility, and this SNP exists only in humans. More importantly, the Arg72Pro polymorphism of TP53 was reported to influence the p53-mediated inflammatory response.<SEP>It is well known that p53 can regulate the expression of miRNAs, especially the miR-34 family members, which compose 3 mature miRNAs that are encoded by 2 different pri-miRNAs. The promoter regions of both transcripts contain p53-binding sites. A potentially functional common SNP rs4938723 (T > C) has been found in the promoter region of miR-34b/c, which may contribute to the susceptibility of HCC in a Chinese population.<SEP>In this study, we hypothesized that SNPs rs4938723 (T > C) in the promoter region of miR-34b/c and TP53 Arg72-Pro were associated with the risk of IA. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped the 2 SNPs in a case-control study of 164 IA patients and 426 healthy controls in a Chinese population.","2. Subjects and Methods<SEP>2.1. Study Populations<SEP>The study was performed with the approval of the hospital ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating in this study. The case-control study population contained 590 unrelated Chinese Han individuals including 164 patients (60 males and 104 females, mean age: 53.1 (±13.1)) with IA and 426 healthy controls (205 males and 221 females, mean age: 51.3 (±8.9)) living in Sichuan province of southwest China. Patients were recruited from the West China Hospital, Sichuan University from January 2008 to September 2009 who were newly diagnosed when they came for emergency because of SAH caused by the rupture of IA or just had general clinical symptoms such as headache or dizziness and diagnosed by DSA (digital subtraction angiography). The control group consisted of 426 healthy volunteers from a routine health survey in the same hospital during the same time as the patients. Subjects with any disease in nervous system or other serious illness were intentionally excluded. There was no significant difference between patients and control subjects in age distribution.<SEP>2.2. Genotyping<SEP>Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 μL EDTA-anticoagulated peripheral blood using a commercial extraction kit (Bioteke Corporation, Beijing, China) according to the instruction manual. We used a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay to detect the genotype of the two SNPs (i.e., miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP-53 Arg72-Pro). Primer sequences, reaction conditions, restriction enzymes (New England BioLabs Inc; Beverly, MA, USA) used, and length of resulting polymerase chain reaction products have been described previously. Restriction fragments were distinguished on 6% polyacrylamide gel and stained with 1.0 g/L argent nitrate to determine the genotypes. The PCR products of the two SNPs with different genotypes were randomly selected to be confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the results were 100% consistent.<SEP>2.3. Statistical Analysis<SEP>In this retrospective study, demographic and clinical data of both groups were compared by the chi-square test and t test. Genotype and allele frequencies of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro were obtained using Modified-Powerstates standard edition software. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested with chi-square test to compare the observed genotype frequencies among the subjects with the expected genotype frequencies. Genotype and allele frequencies of the two SNPs were compared between IA cases and controls using the chi-square tests. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the relative risk conferred by a particular allele, genotype, or the combined genotypes of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro. Statistical significance was set at the P < 0.05 level. All the data were analyzed using the SPSS for windows software package version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).","3. Results<SEP>The two SNPs of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro were successfully genotyped for 164 patients with IA and 426 controls. The clinical characteristics including sex, age of both groups, and the number of aneurysms in the cases enrolled in our study are shown in Table 1. The mean age of all subjects was almost identical. There were more females among the cases (63.4%) than those in the controls (51.9%). The genotype and allele frequencies distribution of both polymorphisms in the control group met the requirements of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genotype and allele frequencies of the two SNPs and the combined genotypes frequencies of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro are summarized in Tables 2, 3 and 4. The CC genotype of miR-34b/c rs4938723 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IA, compared with the TT genotype (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.11–0.73, P = 0.006). However, no association between TP53 Arg72Pro and the risk of IA was observed for genotypic or allelic association analysis. We also examined the combined effects of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro variants on IA risk. As shown in Table 3, the carriers with the combined genotypes of rs4938723CC and TP53 Arg72Pro CG/CC/GG had a 0.27-fold decreased risk of IA (OR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11–0.70, P = 0.004), compared with those carrying rs4938723CT/TT + TP53 Arg72Pro CG/CC/GG combined genotypes, while no other association between combined effects of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro variants on IA risk was found. When stratification analysis was done by gender, no association was found (Tables 5 and 6). No significant association between the two SNPs and the number of aneurysms was observed (Table 7).","4. Discussion<SEP>In this study, we investigated the association between two SNPs (i.e., miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro) and the risk of IA in a Chinese population. We found that the CC genotype of miR-34b/c rs4938723 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IA, compared with the TT genotype. Moreover, a gene interaction of the carriers with the combined genotypes of miR-34b/c rs4938723CC and TP53 Arg72Pro CG/CC/GG had a decreased risk of IA, compared with those carrying miR-34b/c rs4938723 CT/TT + TP53 Arg72Pro CG/CC/GG combined genotypes. However, no difference was found when stratification analysis was done by gender for both miR-34b/c rs4938723CC and TP53 Arg72Pro.<SEP>There are two miR-34 loci in vertebrate genomes, one encoding miR-34a and the other generating both miR-34b and miR-34c. Both genes show little conservation even among closely related species, except in the miRNA-encoding sequences and in short promoter proximal regions that each contains a consensus p53-binding site. Polymorphisms in miRNA genes may alter miRNA processing by changing the stem-loop structure. Although this is not an active processing regulation mechanism, it is evident that SNPs do alter the processing efficiency. Several candidate genes have been analyzed in order to investigate the possible impact of inflammation-associated SNP on the development of IA. When it comes to TP53, the inflammatory microenvironment both activates the p53 network and inactivates the tumor suppressor activity by mutation of the p53 gene. Another link between p53 and inflammation is suggested by studies demonstrating the presence of TP53 mutations in areas of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissues. Frank et al. reported that the Arg72Pro polymorphism of TP53 influences the p53-mediated inflammatory response. The role of p53 in innate immunity and the inflammatory response is now well established and, importantly, is evolutionarily conserved. Also a rat model experiment indicated that inflammation modulates miRNA expression in vivo and the alteration of miR-34b/c under an inflammatory microenvironment can be influenced by p53.<SEP>Although the molecular mechanisms by which miRNA and p53 gene polymorphisms are associated with IA remain unclear, additional functional studies would provide valuable characterization of the molecular mechanisms by which miRNA and TP53  are involved in susceptibility to IA. However, our study provides evidence that miRNA and TP53 polymorphisms may play an important role in individuals' susceptibility to IA.<SEP>There were several limitations in our study. Firstly, detailed lifestyle that may be involved in the occurrence and development of IA was not available. Secondly, the number of subjects in the study was so small which might not be a good representative of the general population. Further studies, therefore, still need to be done.<SEP>In conclusion, we found that the CC genotype of miR-34b/c rs4938723 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IA, and a significant gene interaction of miR-34b/c rs4938723CT/TT and TP53 Arg72Pro CG/CC/GG was evident on the risk of IA. These findings suggest that miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro play a role in the formation, process, or rupture of IA. Nevertheless, our findings need to be replicated in larger, preferably multiethic population-based studies.",10830,['OBWCCE']
23251661,"Introduction<SEP>Obesity is a complex disease influenced by genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. The current surge in childhood obesity in the U.S. is attributable to an interaction between a genetic predisposition toward efficient energy storage and a permissive environment of readily available food and sedentary behaviors. Genetic architecture of common polygenic childhood obesity remains largely unknown. In genetic studies, the phenotypic description of the obese child usually has been limited to body mass index (BMI). BMI represents a composite trait of fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) and thus loci influencing BMI may differ from more direct measures of adiposity. In addition, markers of biological processes underlying the development of obesity such as dietary intake, energy expenditure and nutrient partitioning may be more effectual in identifying causal genetic variants. In epidemiology studies, childhood obesity has been shown to be genetically correlated with glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and risk for fatty liver disease. Identification of genes underlying these distinct patterns of association also may unravel important biological pathways involved in the pathophysiology of childhood obesity.<SEP>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to localize genetic loci contributing to obesity down to a few 100 kb. In fact, a recent meta-analysis of the adult GIANT Consortium established 32 susceptibility BMI loci, several of which were confirmed in French and German children with extreme obesity and European adults with early-onset obesity. Two novel loci near OLFM4 and within HOXB5 were recently reported based on a meta-analysis of 14 pediatric studies of BMI. These pediatric GWAS were confined to BMI and cohorts of European ancestry.<SEP>Here, we present findings from a GWAS designed to identify genetic variants influencing childhood obesity and its comorbidities in the Hispanic population. We have published evidence of heritability, pleiotropy amongst traits, and chromosomal regions implicated in obesity among Hispanic children in our VIVA LA FAMILIA Study In-depth phenotyping was performed to characterize the children, including anthropometry, body composition, growth, metabolites, hormones, inflammation, diet, energy expenditure and substrate utilization and physical activity. Our high-density SNP genotyping and phenotypes representing not only adiposity, but also biological processes associated with the development and consequences of childhood obesity enabled localization of novel genetic loci associated with the pathophysiology of childhood obesity.","Materials and Methods<SEP>The VIVA LA FAMILIA Study was designed to identify genetic variants influencing pediatric obesity and its comorbidities. Family recruitment and phenotyping were conducted in 2000–2005 in Houston, TX. All enrolled children and parents gave written informed consent or assent. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards for Human Subject Research for Baylor College of Medicine and Affiliated Hospitals and for Texas Biomedical Research Institute.<SEP>The VIVA LA FAMILIA study design and methodology have been described in detail elsewhere4. GWAS was performed on 815 children from 263 Hispanic families. The number of families by sibships was: 8 (one child), 40 (two children), 155 (three children), 48 (four children), 6 (five children), 3 (six children), 2 (seven children) and 1 (eight children). Each family was ascertained on an obese proband, defined as a BMI>95th percentile, between the ages 4–19 y. Once identified, the obese proband and all siblings, 4 to 19 y of age, and their parents were invited to the Children’s Nutrition Research Center for a tour and full explanation of the study prior to consenting. The cross-sectional, longitudinal study design consisted of baseline measurements, with a one-year follow-up to track children’s growth and body compositional changes. In-depth baseline phenotyping included vital signs, anthropometry and body composition, diet and physical fitness, 24-h calorimetry, eating behavior, physical activity, fasting blood sampling for DNA and other biochemistries.<SEP>Briefly, blood pressure, heart rate and temperature were taken using an automated monitor. Anthropometric measurements were performed using standardized techniques according to Lohman. Body composition was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Repeated measures after one year were used to compute growth velocities and changes in FM, FFM and energy storage. Methods used to measure fasting blood and 24-h urinary biochemistries are described elsewhere. A multiple-pass 24-h dietary recall was recorded on two occasions using Nutrition Data System (NDS). Eating behavior was assessed with a dinner meal and eating in the absence of hunger. Room respiration calorimetry was used to make 24-h measurements of energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) and heart rate maximum (HRmax) were measured on a treadmill. Actiwatch accelerometers were used to measure frequency, duration and intensity of physical activity.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>The Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad v1.0 BeadChips were used to genotype 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 815 children enrolled in the VIVA LA FAMILIA Study. Genotype calls were obtained after scanning on the Illumina BeadStation 500GX and analysis using the GenomeStudio software. Our genotyping error rate (based on duplicates) was 2 per 100,000 genotypes. Illumina has included sample-dependent and -independent controls on their BeadChips to test for accuracy of the procedure. The average call rate for all SNPs per individual sample was 97%.<SEP>SNP genotypes were checked for Mendelian consistency using the program SimWalk2. The estimates of the allele frequencies and their standard errors were obtained using SOLAR. Specific SNPs were removed from analysis if they had call rates <95% (n = 6,596), were uncommon alleles in less than 5 participants (26,537), deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (n = 0), or were monoallelic (n = 56,448). The number of SNPs that passed quality control and were included in the GWA analysis was 899,892.<SEP>Genome-wide Association Analysis<SEP>Measured genotype analysis (MGA) was performed using the SOLAR program. All phenotypes were transformed by inverse normalization to meet assumptions of normality. We obtained residuals using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, their interaction and higher order terms. Because energy expenditure is strongly influenced by body weight across the age range of 4 to 19 years of age, total energy expenditure and sleeping energy expenditure were additionally adjusted for body weight. Also, observed energy intakes consumed in a snack and dinner were adjusted for total energy expenditure or estimated energy requirement, again to compensate for the wide range of ages in our cohort.<SEP>Each SNP genotype was converted in SOLAR to a covariate measure equal to 0, 1, or 2 copies of the minor allele (or, for missing genotypes, the weighted covariate based on imputation). These covariates were included in the variance-components mixed models for measured genotype analyses versus null models that incorporated the random effect of kinship and fixed effects such as age, sex, their interaction and higher order terms. For the initial GWA screen, we tested each SNP covariate independently as a 1 degree of freedom likelihood ratio test. The p-value threshold for genome-wide significance (alpha = 0.05) was set at 1.01×10−7. The p-value threshold for genome-wide significance was computed for our family-based cohort that takes into account pedigree structure. The effective number of SNPs given linkage disequilibrium (LD) was calculated by the method of Moskvina and Schmidt as implemented in SOLAR. LD was computed in SOLAR using all available information (all genotyped SNPs on all individuals). The average ratio of SNP effective number/actual number obtained from analysis of 1,989 non-overlapping bins of SNPs was used to calculate the genome-wide effective number of tests and thus the significance threshold for genome-wide association. We performed quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (implemented in SOLAR) to test for population stratification.","Results<SEP>GWAS was performed on 815 children from 263 Hispanic families. Mean ± SD (range) was 25.2±7.5 (13.4 to 61.9) for the children’s BMI, 85.6±20.8 (4 to100) for BMI percentile and 1.52±1.01 (−3.0 to 4.5) for BMI z-score. Measured genotype analysis examined 129 obesity-related traits including BMI and adiposity as well as biological processes associated with the pathophysiology of childhood obesity; a description of the phenotypes is provided in Table S1. In our GWAS, population stratification was not significant and therefore did not confound our associations. A complete listing of all suggestive (p<1.0E-06) and genome-wide significant (p<1.0E-07) genetic variants and their associated traits are presented by chromosomal position in Table S2.<SEP>Anthropometry and Body Composition<SEP>BMI status, body composition and the growth process were assessed from repeated measurements of body weight, height, FFM and FM at baseline and after one-year ( Table 1 ). A nonsynonymous SNP (rs1056513; G1178S (NP_005790.2)) in INADL on chromosome 1 attained near genome-wide significance (p = 1.2E-07) for weight, and BMI, FFM, FM, trunk FM, and hip circumference (p = 8.3E-06 to 1.6E-07). SNP rs1056513 is common (MAF = 0.50) and accounted for 3% of the variance in body weight and body composition in this cohort. Weight z-score change was significantly associated with an intronic variant in COL4A1 on chromosome 13 (p = 4.7E-08) (Supporting Information Figure S1). Linear growth (height change) was associated with a variant in the 5′UTR region of TSEN34 on chromosome 19 (p = 4.5E-08).<SEP>Endometabolic Traits<SEP>Genome-wide significant variants were identified for several endometabolic traits ( Table 2 ). An intronic variant in MTNR1B on chromosome 11 was strongly associated with fasting glucose (p = 3.7E-08). Intronic and 3′UTR variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region on chromosome 11 were associated with triglycerides (p = 2.5-4.8E-08). An intronic variant in PCSK2 on chromosome 20 was associated with total antioxidants (p = 7.6E-08). Variants in the flanking 3′UTR regions of RNASE1 on chromosome 14 and ASS1P11 on chromosome 7 were associated with 24-h urinary nitrogen excretion and creatinine excretion, respectively (p = 8.2-8.4E-08). An intronic SNP in GCH1 on chromosome 14 was associated with 24-h urinary dopamine: creatinine ratio (p = 6.3E-08). A nonsynonymous SNP (rs3733402; S143T (NP_000883.2)) in KLKB1 on chromosome 4 was identified for serum free IGF-1. An intronic SNP in MPRIP on chromosome 17 was associated with serum IGFBP-3 (p = 7.2E-08). A block of twenty-three SNPs in the flanking 5′UTR region of XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) on chromosome 9 were highly associated with serum TSH (p = 5.5E-08 to 1.0E-09) and found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with one another (R = 0.91−1.00).<SEP>Inflammation Markers<SEP>Genome-wide significant variants were identified for inflammation markers ( Table 3 ). Highly significant associations for a nonsynonymous SNP (rs12075; G42D (NP_002027.2) (p = 1.3E-21) and an intronic SNP (p = 3.6E-13) in DARC on chromosome 1 were identified for MCP-1. Coding variants in GREB1 on chromosome 2 (p = 6.5E-08) and DFNB31 on chromosome 9 (p = 2.0E-08) were also identified for MCP-1. A variants in the 3′UTR for CCR3 was highly associated with MCP1, as well as an intronic SNP in RASGEF1A (p = 4.6-9.6E-08). A variant in the intronic region of ABO was strongly associated with IL-6 (p = 2.0E-08).<SEP>Diet, Energy Expenditure, Substrate Utilization and Physical Activity<SEP>Genome-wide significant variants were associated with energy intake, energy expenditure and substrate utilization, and physical activity ( Table 4 ). An intronic variant in TMEM229B on chromosome 14 was associated with ad libitum energy intake at dinner (p = 5.1E-08). An intronic variant in ARHGAP11A on chromosome 15 was associated with sleep duration (p = 5.0E-08). A SNP in the intronic region of C21orf34 was detected for respiratory quotient (RQ) during sleep (p = 5.3E-08). A variant was identified for accelerometer-measured light activity in the 5′UTR region of RPL7P3 on chromosome 9 (p = 7.5E-08) and sedentary-light activity in 3′UTR of CTCFL on chromosome 20 (p = 3.6E-08). In addition, adjusting for body weight, highly significant variants were identified for total energy expenditure (p = 2.7E-08) for MATK on chromosome 19 and sleeping energy expenditure (p = 6.0E-08) for CHRNA3 on chromosome 15.","Discussion<SEP>Extensive phenotyping and high-density SNP genotyping enabled localization of novel genetic loci associated with the pathophysiology of obesity in Hispanic children. Our unprecedented phenotypes represent not only adiposity, but also biological processes underlying the development of childhood obesity. The number of genome-wide significant genetic variants detected substantiates our analytical strategy and statistical power to identify variants.<SEP>Genome-wide significant and suggestive genetic variants were associated with anthropometric indices, body composition and growth rate. The common nonsynonymous SNP rs1056513 in INADL accounted for 3% of the variance in body weight and body composition, and is highly conserved across mammalian species. INADL encodes a PDZ domain-containing protein thought to play a role in tight junctions and adipocyte differentiation. Weight z-score change observed over one-year was associated with an intronic variant in COL4A1, which encodes a basement membrane collagen. Height change was associated with a 5′UTR variant inTSEN34, which is involved in tRNA splicing, a fundamental process required for cell growth and division.<SEP>Fasting serum glucose was associated with an intronic variant (MAF = 0.20; effect size 4.8%) in MTNR1B which encodes one of the melatonin receptors expressed in the retina and brain. Corroborating our findings, this variant (rs10830963) has been strongly associated with fasting glucose levels in adults and children. Melatonin, the ligand to MTNR1B, has an inhibitory effect on insulin secretion resulting in elevated fasting glucose.<SEP>Fasting serum triglycerides were associated with variants in the intron and 3′UTRs within the APOA5-ZNF259 region. APOA5 is an important determinant of circulating triglyceride levels. SNPs detected in our GWAS have been associated with triglycerides in other populations. In the Kosrae population, triglyceride levels were associated with seven SNPs near APOC3/A5 . Variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region (including rs3741298) were associated with HDL-C and ApoA-1 response to therapy with statins and fenofibric acid in patients with dyslipidemia.<SEP>Association with total antioxidants was shown for a variant in PCSK2, a proprotein convertase that is involved in proteolytic processing of neuropeptide and hormone precursors. PCSK2 is highly expressed in the islets of Langerhans, where it plays a role in the conversion of proinsulin to insulin.<SEP>A LD block of 23 SNPs in the XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) region was highly associated with fasting serum TSH (MAF = 0.25-0.29, effect size = 2.9-3.8%). The association is likely attributed to FOXE1 rather than XPA which is involved in DNA excision repair and the skin disease xeroderma pigmentosum. FOXE1 or thyroid transcription factor 2 (TTF-2) belongs to the ‘forkhead’ gene family and is involved in promoting the migration process or in repressing differentiation of the thyroid follicular cells until migration has occurred and has been associated with thyroid cancer. In the Kosrae population, plasma TSH levels were strongly associated with 10 SNPs in a region encompassing TTF-2 on chromosome 9. In a cohort of Caucasian adults, genetic variation in FOXE1(TTF-2) showed significant effects on free T4 levels and borderline effects on serum TSH. Three of the SNPs (rs925488, rs1877431, rs1588635) detected in the VIVA cohort was also reported by Lowe et.al (38); there was no overlap with Medici et al (43). Also, three of the SNPs (rs2805809, rs2668804, rs2808693) reported by Lowe et al. (38) was in high linkage disequilibrium (1.00) with rs2805771, rs2808699, rs7875482 detected in the VIVA cohort. This is a region of high LD, located in the 5′UTR-region of the gene which has been shown to influence transcriptional regulation of FOXE1(TTF-2). The functional variant is likely to be situated at this locus, but its exact localization remains to be elucidated in future studies, involving in-depth resequencing.<SEP>A unifying role of inflammation in chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity is emerging. In the VIVA GWAS, variants in six genes were associated with proinflammatory markers. Our findings support a major role of Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) in the regulation of the circulating levels of the cysteine-cysteine (CC) chemokine, MCP-1 (effect size = ∼10%). In circulation, MCP-1 is bound to erythrocyte DARC that acts as a chemokine receptor/reservoir of proinflammatory cytokines. Our strongest association for MCP-1 was with a nonsynonymous, highly conservedSNP in DARC (rs12075; MAF = 0.44) which replicated results from the Framingham Heart Study GWAS in Caucasian adults. MCP-1 was also associated with SNPs in GREB1, DFNB31, RASGEF1A, and CCR3. Huber et al. found increased expression of CCR3 in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in obese patients compared to lean controls. Studies by Schnabel et al and Naitza et al. found suggestive associations of serum MCP-1 with CCR2 which is also a MCP-1 receptor and is in the same region of chromosome 3 as CCR3, and referred to as the CCR2/CCR3 cytokine receptor gene cluster.<SEP>Fasting serum IL-6 levels were associated with variants in the ABO gene that determines blood group. ABO blood group has been found to be associated with a number of biomarkers such as von Willebrand factor levels, Factor VIII levels, thrombomodulin, TNF-α and ICAM-1, and in our case IL-6. The mechanism by which the A and B alleles affect these biomarkers is uncertain. In Caucasians with and without type 1 diabetes, a variant rs579459 near the ABO blood group gene accounted for 19% of the variance in E-selectin levels; in our GWAS, this same variant was associated with IL-6 levels (p = 1.7E-07; Table S2).<SEP>Total energy expenditure, adjusted for body weight, was significantly associated with rs12104221 in MATK which encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase involved in signal transduction pathways. Sleeping energy expenditure, adjusted for body weight, was associated with rs8040868 in CHRNA3 (cholinergic receptor, neuronal nicotinic, alpha polypeptide 3), a member of a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal transmission at synapses. After binding to acetylcholine, the receptor responds by opening ion-conducting channels across the plasma membrane, suggesting a plausible role of the coding variant (rs8040868) in energy metabolism. Acetylcholine receptors activate proopiomelanocortin neurons that in turn activate melanocortin-4 receptors that are involved in the regulation of energy intake and expenditure.<SEP>Sleep duration was associated with an intronic SNP in ARHGAP11A (rho GTPase activating protein 11A) that encodes a 1,023-amino acid protein that has a rhoGAP domain and tyrosine phosphorylation site. Evidence is emerging that obesity affects sleep, and that sleep patterns and disorders may have an effect on weight. Although the mechanism is unclear, sleep disturbances are characteristic of Prader Willi Syndrome, caused by a deletion in 15q11-q13 that encompasses ARHGAP11A .<SEP>Sedentary-light physical activity was associated with a variant in CTCFL, an 11-zinc-finger factor involved in gene regulation. CTCFL forms methylation-sensitive insulators that regulate X-chromosome inactivation which may play a role in epigenetic regulation.<SEP>Variants in the 11 genes known to cause extreme early-onset obesity also may contribute to milder forms of obesity. None of the genotyped variants in genes for monogenic obesity reached genome-wide significance in our GWAS, although several variants in CRHR1, CRHR2, MCHR1, MC3R, MC4R and POMC were nominally associated. Similarly, variants in or nearby the susceptibility genes for obesity did not attain genome-wide significance but several - CHST8, KCTD15, MTCH2, SFRS10, SH2B1 and TMEM18 - were nominally associated with obesity-related traits, consistent with GWAS in children of European-American or European ancestry. The lack of genome-wide significant findings for monogenic causes of obesity or susceptibility genes may be a function of our sample size and statistical power, or the presence of rare variants in the Hispanic population not represented in the Illumina platform.<SEP>The VIVA LA FAMILIA Study is unique in its consideration of a pediatric Hispanic population. We believe that our extensive phenotyping and genotyping enabled localization of novel genetic loci associated with obesity in Hispanic children, despite our relatively small sample size. Our phenotypes represent not only adiposity, but also biological processes underlying the development and consequences of childhood obesity. We applied a standard and stringent approach to our measured genotype analysis, but do agree replication is desirable. We believe we have identified genes that warrant further investigation.<SEP>In conclusion, unprecedented in-depth phenotyping and high-density SNP genotyping enabled the localization of novel genetic loci associated with the pathophysiology of obesity in Hispanic children. Identified genome-wide significant loci: 1) corroborated genes implicated in other studies (MTNR1B, ZNF259/APOA5, XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2), DARC, CCR3, ABO); 2) localized novel genes in plausible biological pathways (PCSK2, ARHGAP11A, CHRNA3); and 3) revealed novel genes with unknown function in obesity pathogenesis (MATK, COL4A1). As with other GWAS, the variants identified are likely not the actual causal variants but rather markers for genomic regions or loci in which the causal variants lie. Characterization of the underlying functional genetic variants contributing to this serious public health problem in Hispanic children will involve additional study.",22659,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
25955518,"Introduction<SEP>The largest GWAS study on BMI including a total of 339,224 individuals identified 97 genetic loci associated with increased BMI. One chromosomal region (chr16p11.2) is tagged by two lead SNPs separated by more than 500 kb. One of the SNPs (3888190) is located near ATP2A1 (ATPase, Ca++ transporting, cardiac muscle, fast twitch 1 gene) and SH2B1 (Src-homology 2B adaptor protein 1 gene), the other signal (rs2650492) is near SBK1 (SH3 domain binding kinase 1 gene) and APOBR (apolipoprotein B receptor gene). Both tag a large region with high linkage disequilibrium (LD) which has solidly been replicated for obesity and BMI. Besides the GWAS findings, a large deletion in the same chromosomal region 16p11.2 was associated with obesity, developmental delay and autism. The reciprocal duplication of the same chromosomal region is associated with reduced BMI, developmental delay and schizophrenia.<SEP>The most plausible obesity gene in the region is SH2B1. SH2B1 is a mediator of energy homeostasis and increases leptin and insulin potency in downstream signaling pathways. Sh2b1 knockout mice are obese, hyperphagic and exhibit traits of the metabolic syndrome like hyperlipidemia, leptin resistance, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. In SH2B1 we detected a rare mutation solely in obese individuals; additionally we replicated the obesity association of the GWAS SNP rs7498665 (SH2B1: p.Thr484Ala). Another group also described SH2B1 mutations in extremely obese children with insulin resistance. As the infrequent mutations cannot explain the genome-wide association signal and so far, no functional effect of the frequent SNP has been detected, we analysed additional promising obesity candidate genes in the same chromosomal region.<SEP>Lead SNPs in GWAS can tag large regions of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) which can comprise one to several genes/variants that are relevant for the analyzed phenotype. For the region on chr16p11.2, Speliotes et al. listed non-synonymous SNPs in adjacent genes (SH2B1, APOBR, SULT1A2) in high LD (r2>0.75) with the lead SNP rs7359397 (, see supplementary material). Additionally for a total of four adjacent genes, involvement in weight regulation seems likely because they are either (a) biological candidates (SH2B1), or differentially expressed in adipose tissue between general population and patients who underwent bariatric surgery (SH2B1, SULT1A1, SULT1A2, TUFM). Further fine mapping of the chromosomal region for causal variants that contribute to the obesity association has not yet been undergone.<SEP>The APOBR gene encodes a macrophage receptor that regulates fat and vitamin uptake into cells. Non-synonymous variants (rs180743: p.Pro428Ala and rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9) in APOBR are associated with hypercholesterolemia. Mice fed a high fat diet until they became obese showed increased expression of APOBR and hence increased lipid intake in macrophages of the adipose tissue. This is mediated by the transcription factors PPARα, PPARβ/δ, PPARγ and the PPAR-RXR transcriptional complex. In normal weight humans, a single meal with high fat content (72% of the total energy of the meal) increased both APOBR expression and lipid uptake in monocytes. High blood lipid levels differentially regulate APOBR expression in human postprandial monocytes and macrophages and lead to foam cell formation.<SEP>The sulfotransferase genes SULT1A1 and SULT1A2 are located close to each other on chr16p11.2. Both proteins sulfonate hormones like estrogens, estrogenic alkylphenols, 17-β-estradiol and several androgens, so that the hormones can be excreted. Obesity is associated with increased levels of 17-β-estradiol, estron and estron sulfate which are substrates of SULT1A2. Childhood obesity is associated with an increased risk of adult obesity and Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. Association of a non-synonymous SNP (rs141581853: SULT1A1 p.Arg213His) with obesity but not hypertension had been described. The regulation of SULT1A1 expression in diet induced obesity (DIO) rats in adipose tissue and liver was dependent on the dietary fat content.<SEP> TUFM encodes a transcription factor for mitochondrial gene expression. (1) Exclusive maternal inheritance of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA, (2) stronger correlation with maternal than paternal BMI and (3) the relevance of mitochondria for energy metabolism indicate that genes involved in mitochondrial function are relevant candidate genes for weight regulation. TUFM expression is up regulated in DIO rats on a high fat diet. In human cultured hippocampal neurons, BDNF stimulation down regulated the expression of TUFM.<SEP>In order to fine map the chromosomal region chr16p11.2 for further obesity associated variants, we screened the coding regions of APOBR, SULT1A1, SULT1A2, and TUFM for variants in 95 extremely obese children and adolescents. Most of these individuals were enriched for the likely presence of mutations in high LD with the original obesity association signal. Our focus was the detection of common to infrequent variants (MAF > 0.01) which affect the protein sequence. Previously it was shown, for instance for the MC4R, that GWAS results point to genes in which functionally relevant mutations are found more frequently in cases than in controls. These infrequent mutations might also have a major gene effect. Although synthetic association does not seem to be a frequent mechanism, GWAS results and mutation screens frequently depict the same genes. Subsequently, we confirmed the detected non-synonymous variants in independent study groups.","Material and Methods<SEP>Study groups<SEP>An overview of the study groups can be found in Table 1 (see also), details of recruitment have been described previously. We included children and adolescents (mean age = 13.25 ± 3.26 years) with a BMI above the 97th BMI percentile. Written informed consent was given by all participants and in case of minors by their parents. These studies were approved by the Ethics Committees of the respective Universities (Marburg: ‘Ethik-Kommission des Fachbereichs Medizin der Philipps-Universität Marburg’: ethic commission of the Medical Faculty of the Philipps-University Marburg, Duisburg-Essen: ‘Ethik-Kommission der Medizinischen Fakultät der Universität Duisburg-Essen’: ethic commission of the Medical Faculty of the University of Duisburg-Essen) and were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.<SEP>Mutation screen<SEP>The selection of extremely obese individuals for the mutation screen was based on genotypes at SNP rs2008514 (proxy of rs7359397) in the chromosomal region 16p11.2. In total, we analyzed 95 extremely obese individuals, 90 of whom were likely enriched for the presence of infrequent mutations at chr16p11.2 that contribute to the association signal of rs2008514. These extremely obese patients (offspring) from the family-based GWAS sample were homozygous for the obesity risk allele T at rs2008514 and had at least one heterozygous parent, thus substantially contributing to the observed over-transmission of the rs2008514 T-allele in our previous study. The other five individuals harbor a deletion on chr16p11.2 that does not include the genes which were screened for mutations here. The 95 individuals were screened for mutations in APOBR (NM ID: 55911, chr16:28,505,970–28,510,291), SULT1A1 (NM ID: 6817, chr16:28,617,142–28,620,176), SULT1A2 (NM ID: 6799, chr16:28,603,349–28,607,251) and TUFM (NM ID: 7284, chr16:28,854,296–28,857,590, positions given for GRCh37/hg19). All primers can be found in (S3 Table).<SEP>Depending on the size of the screened fragment, one of the following two methods was used for the mutation screen of the coding region of each gene as described previously: We used single stranded conformation polymorphism analyses for PCR amplicons up to 300bp or denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography for PCR amplicons up to 600bp. Using these fragment sizes both methods achieve a high sensitivity (below 5% error rate) which is very well compatible with Sanger sequencing. All PCR amplicons with dHPLC/SSCP patterns deviant from the wild-type pattern were re-sequenced as described previously. At least two experienced individuals independently assigned the deviant patterns; discrepancies were solved either by reaching consensus or by re-screening.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>The non-synonymous variants identified in the mutation screens in SULT1A1, and SULT1A2 were genotyped in 355 obesity families by MALDI TOF, RFLP and tetra ARMS PCR (Fig 1). The missense variants in APOBR (rs180743: p.Pro428Ala; rs3833080: p. Gly369_Asp370del9; rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9) were genotyped in the following independent study groups by either gel electrophoresis of PCR products (for deletions and insertions) or TaqMan assay (detailed information can be obtained from the authors): 615 obesity trios (extremely obese child or adolescent with both biological parents) and the case-control GWAS study groups (453 extremely obese cases and 435 lean controls described in; see above) and 1,383 obese and overweight children and adolescents (Datteln Paediatric Obese Cohort). At least two experienced individuals independently assigned the genotypes; discrepancies were solved either by reaching consensus or by re-genotyping. In case of the trios, Mendelian inheritance was checked. For the other study groups, Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was assessed and fulfilled. All enzymes and protocols can be obtained from the authors.<SEP>Statistics<SEP>For association studies in the above-mentioned 453 cases and 435 controls Fisher’s exact test (allelic association) was calculated with PLINK adjusted for sex and age of the individuals. In the 615 trios, an asymptotic, 2-tailed p-value for the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was calculated with PLINK. The initial screening sample was excluded from the further analyses. All p-values are asymptotic, two-sided and not corrected for multiple testing unless stated otherwise. Additionally to univariate analysis, we conducted a joint analysis of the significant SNPs to reveal if these SNPs descend from the same signal. This was done with R 3.1.0 without any further adjustment.<SEP>Functional in silico analyzes<SEP>All detected variants were analyzed for loss or gain of cryptic splice sites (ESEfinder, ESRSearch, RESCUE_ESE), and transcription factor binding sites (TFSearch, Consite). Prediction of an impact of an amino acid exchange on structure and function was performed by PANTHER, PolyPhen-2, SNAP, PMUT, and MutationTaster. For the InDel variants, PROVEAN was used for functional prediction.","Results<SEP>APOBR<SEP>The mutation screen of the coding region of the APOBR in 95 extremely obese children and adolescents revealed 13 sequence variants (rs74949322, rs151233, rs149271, rs3833080, rs368546180, rs180743, rs180744, rs151174, rs40831, rs61738759, rs200751685, rs40833, and rs142786317; S1 Table). Three of these affect the amino acid sequence (rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9, rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9, and rs180743: p.Pro428Ala; Table 2).<SEP>The common deletion rs3833080 (c.1036_1062del27; S1 Data) was present in each individual of the initial screen either hetero- or homozygously. The variant is located in the repeat region of APOBR with no predicted function and deletes one full repeat [GlyGlyGluGluAlaGluThrAlaSer] of the amino acid sequence. In silico prediction for rs3833080 implicated no functional effect (Table 2).<SEP>The non-synonymous, non-conservative SNP rs180743: p.Pro428Ala is located closely to the deletion rs3833080 which is in high LD with the variant (r2 = 0.98). Due to the high LD with rs2008514, both variants were carried, at least heterozygously, in all individuals of the initial screen. Functional in silico prediction for the risk allele is variable, although the SNP is located in a conserved position (conservation 66% among 29 species, ENSEMBL). SIFT and PolyPhen2 rated this SNP as deleterious, while PANTHER, SNAP and PMUT rated it as neutral (Table 2). Although the overall prediction is “Polymorphism”, Mutation Taster predicted the introduction of a new splice site, thereby disruption of a glutamate-rich region and potential loss of a phosphoserine domain (Table 2).<SEP>The deletion rs368546180 with a length of 27bp (c.933_934insdel27; p.Ala328_Gly329) results in an in frame shortened amino acid sequence of the repeat region of APOBR with no predicted function. The in silico prediction of the variant is ambiguous (Mutation Taster “Polymorphism”, SIFT “neutral”, PROVEAN “deleterious”; Table 2). It was identified once heterozygously in an extremely obese child. The female mutation carrier (height 147 cm, weight 49 kg, BMI 22.68 kg/m2, BMI SDS 1.44, age 10.5 years, 93rd age and sex specific BMI percentile) inherited the mutation from her obese mother (BMI 39.06 kg/m2) while the overweight (BMI 25.65 kg/m2) father did not harbor the deletion. The girl also homozygously carried the risk alleles (minor alleles) at rs180743: p.Pro428Ala and rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9.<SEP>Case-control association analyses based on 1,873 extremely obese cases and 435 lean controls were performed for the two frequent, coding variants rs180743: p.Pro428Ala and rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9 and the second infrequent deletion rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9. The APOBR rs180743 G-allele was nominally associated with obesity (odds ratio (OR) per allele = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–1.47, p = 0.002, see Table 3). Similarly, the deletion allele of rs3833080 was nominally associated with obesity (OR = 1.25 per allele; 95%CI: 1.08–1.45, p = 0.003). Family-based association studies (based on 615 obesity trios) for rs3833080 and rs180743 confirmed these associations (Table 3). While genotyping rs3833080 we also observed the insertion allele (p.Gly369_Asp370insGluGluAlaGlyThrAlaSerGlyGly), with a much lower frequency and exclusively in (extremely) obese cases (minor allele frequency of 0.001 in 2,540 cases) but not in 481 lean or normal weight controls. The second deletion rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9 was only observed once in all screened individuals. Consequently, association analysis could not be performed (Table 3).<SEP>The remaining nine variants were located in the un-translated region (UTR) or intronic regions or were synonymous (rs74949322: c.57+50C>T, rs151233: p.Leu22 =, rs149271: p.Glu170 =, rs180744: p.Gln553 =, rs151174: p.Gly560 =, rs40831: p.Ala686 =, rs61738759: p.Pro1012 =, rs40833: c.*218C>G and rs142786317: c.*118_*119delCA; S1 Table). In silico analysis showed that the infrequent alleles at these variants caused changes of either transcription factor binding sites splicing enhancer and silencer binding sites, or both (S1 Table).<SEP>SULT1A1<SEP>Of the initially detected variants (7 non-synonymous, S2 Data) in the coding region of SULT1A1 in 95 extremely obese children and adolescents, none could be confirmed with an independent method. A high sequence similarity between the SULT1A gene family allowed for unspecific amplification of several SULT1A genes for individuals in the mutation screen resulting in artifacts. Hence, apart from SULT1A1 we also amplified one or more SULT1 gene family members. So that a variant that seemed to be located in SULT1A1 was in fact attributable to SULT1A2, where it represents the wild type allele (see S2 Data and S2 Table for more detail). For the variant Met1Val, which could not be explained by one of the other SULT1A family members, two independent genotyping methods could not replicate our initial uni-directional Sanger-resequencing finding. We hence deemed this variant an artifact.<SEP>For the synonymous variants in SULT1A1, in silico predictions varied. All variants were predicted to change splicing enhancer and silencers, or to directly affect splice sites or transcription factor binding sites (S1 Table). Particularly for the variant p.Pro200 = (rs3176926), both changes in the binding domains of splicing regulators as well for the transcription factor AML-1 were predicted.<SEP>SULT1A2<SEP>In SULT1A2 seven non-synonymous SNPs were detected (rs4149403: p.Ile7Thr, rs10797300: p.Pro19Leu, rs145008170: p.Ser44Asn, rs4987024: p.Tyr62Phe, rs142241142: p.Ala164Val, rs1059491: p.Asn235Thr, rs75191166: p.Lys282Gly); two synonymous SNPs (rs1690407: p.Ser8 =, rs139896537: p.Ala164 =; S1 Table), and five non-coding variants (rs4149406, rs3743963, rs710410, rs762634, rs145790611; S1 Table) were also identified.<SEP>For the non-conservative, non-synonymous SNP rs1136703: p.Ile7Thr (c.20T/C), in silico analyses did not predict a functional effect (Table 2). For rs10797300: p.Pro19Leu (c.56C/T), in silico programs predicted a functional modification (PolyPhen2 and PANTHER, Table 2). The conservative non-synonymous polymorphism rs145008170: p.Ser44Asn (c.131G/A) is located close to Lys48, which is relevant for binding of the xenobiotic p-nitrophenol to the binding pocket of SULT1A2. In silico analyses predicted a “non-neutral” (SNAP) or “deleterious” (PANTHER; Table 2) functional change. The infrequent missense variants rs4987024: p.Tyr62Phe (c.185A/T) and rs142241142: p.Ala164Val (c.491C/T) are non-conservative amino acid exchanges which are not located close to the binding pocket of SULT1A2. In silico, a higher probability of functional changes was predicted for p.Tyr62Phe than for p.Ala164Val (Poly Phen 2 “probably damaging”), although the analyses revealed mixed results (Table 2). In silico prediction mostly interpreted the conservative SNP rs1059491: p.Asn235Thr (c.704A/C) as functionally relevant (“probably damaging” PolyPhen2, “non-neutral” SNAP and “deleterious” SIFT; Table 2). None of the analyzed non-synonymous SNPs in SULT1A2 showed association with obesity in 355 obesity trios (TDT; Table 3).<SEP> In silico predictions vary for the two known synonymous SNPs (rs1690407: p.Ser8 =, rs139896537: p.Ala164 =) and the five non-coding variants (rs4149406: c.148+34T/C, rs3743963: c.500−19T/C, rs710410: c.*7T/C, rs762634: c.*14A>G, rs145790611: c.241+39G/A). For each variant, at least a change in either transcription factor binding sites or splicing enhancer or silencer sites was predicted (S1 Table).<SEP>TUFM<SEP>In TUFM, the previously unknown variant c.3536C>G was detected in the 3’ untranslated region (previously unknown). In addition, non-coding intronic variants were detected (rs7187776: c.-55T>C, rs4788099: c.817+13T>C, rs8061877: c.248−18G>A, and rs61737565: c.922+29C>G). All five variants in TUFM are predicted to lead to altered splicing regulator or transcription factor binding sites (S1 Table). For rs8061877, the disruption of a transcription factor binding site was predicted (TFSearch and Consite), although for different transcription factors (SRY, HFH 2, HMG-IY; S1 Table). For the previously unknown variant g.28854194C/G, in silico prediction showed a change in splice enhancer binding sites and splicing silencer sites by three programs (S1 Table). Also, alterations in splice sites for this variant were predicted (Mutation Taster) despite the variant being in the non-coding 3’ UTR of TUFM.","Discussion<SEP>Previous studies on the causal variation underlying the obesity association of chr16p11.2 mainly focused on the SH2B1 gene. Mutation screens in humans have revealed a number of mutations that are too infrequent to explain the genome-wide association of the lead SNP with BMI and obesity. The coding variant rs7498665 (SH2B1: p.Thr484Ala) was identified in GWAS studies as lead obesity association signal for a linkage disequilibrium block encompassing 1 Mb. However, this SNP showed no functional effect on STAT3 mediated leptin signaling or the phosphorylation of JAK1 or IRS1 in insulin signaling. Hence, variants underlying the genome-wide significant finding may be located outside the SH2B1 coding region, but in high LD with the original association signal as proposed by Speliotes et al.. We therefore screened the coding region of APOBR, SULT1A1, SULT1A2 and TUFM for mutations in 95 extremely obese German children and adolescents.<SEP>We identified 13 variants in the APOBR coding region, three of which were non-synonymous or deletions. These (rs180743: p.Pro428Ala, rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9, and rs368546180 p.Thr321_Gly329del9) were genotyped in our trios and case-control study groups. The variants p.Pro428Ala and p.Gly369_Asp370del9 are located close to each other; their LD is high (r2 = 0.98) and their minor alleles are associated with obesity in our sample (OR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.09–1.47, p = 0.002; pBonferroni corrected = 0.026 and p = 0.003; pBonferroni corrected = 0.039, OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.08–1.45, respectively; Table 3) As the LD and proximity of both polymorphisms with the initial lead SNP and the non-synonymous polymorphism rs7498665 (SH2B1: p.Thr484Ala) is very high, the obesity association of all variants are dependent signals. Conditional analysis increased all p-values for rs180743, rs3833080, and rs7498665 above 0.7, indicating high signal dependency. Previously association of the minor alleles of both variants with hypercholesterolemia had been described. Of note, the hypercholesterolemia and obesity risk allele C of rs180743 was not associated with weight loss during a 1 year lifestyle intervention in children and adolescents although the position of the SNP is conserved (conservation 66% over 29 species, ENSEMBL). The second deletion (rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9) was only detected once in our sample of 2,179 obese cases and 435 normal weight or lean controls. Hence, obesity association assessment was not possible. Although variant rs368546180 is in-frame and located in the repeat region of APOBR which has no predicted function, in silico prediction of the variant implicated a potentially reduced function (Table 2).<SEP>Almost all initially screened individuals are homozygous carriers of obesity risk alleles at the rs180743 (p.Pro428Ala) and rs3833080 (p.Gly369_Asp370del9) polymorphisms. Our results suggest that an in vitro functional validation of both deletion rs3833080 and SNP rs180743 would be of interest. Brown et al suggested a contribution to binding of the specific ligand apoB48 of the repeat region in which both variants are located, with alterations possibly leading to reduced uptake of chylomicrons (CMs) or CM remnants. This hypothesis could be tested by lipoprotein-uptake assays or ligand blotting, as suggested by Daniel et al. and Brown et al..<SEP>In SULT1A2, none of the variants was associated with obesity (Table 3), so they do not contribute to our initial TDT finding although some of the variants were predicted to have functional effects. Of the detected missense variants, several have known in vitro functional effects on xenobiotic sulfonation, e.g. rs4149404 (p.Ile7Thr), rs10797300 (p.Pro19Ser), and rs1059491 (p.Asn235Thr). Glatt et al. reported an obesity association for the minor allele of SULT1A1 rs141581853 p.Arg213His in SULT1A1; the variant was not detected in our screen. In contrast to SULT1A1 which shows ubiquitous expression, the expression of SULT1A2 is limited to liver, blood platelets, heart, brain and skin. Both sulfotransferases share their substrates. Even if the detected variants entail biological functional changes at the protein level, other sulfotransferases can most likely compensate for the function of each other in vivo when only one sulfotransferase is affected.<SEP>In addition to these variants which directly affect the amino acid composition of the proteins, recent studies detected a cis-regulatory element (intronic SNP rs4788099 in SH2B1) which affects the expression of nearby genes (TUFM, coiled-coil domain containing 101 gene: CCDC101, Homo sapiens spinster homolog 1 gene: SPNS1, SULT1A1 and sulfotransferase family, cytosolic, 1A, phenolpreferring, member 4 gene: SULT1A4) in B cells and monocytes. In rodents, differential regulation of the central nervous expression of several genes on chr16p11.2 was shown in reaction to high caloric diets. The GWAS lead SNP rs7359397 also affects the expression of SULT1A1, SPNS1 and TUFM, but not SH2B1 in cis. Although the SNP alone only explained 0.0086% of the genetic variance of BMI, the expression changes elicited in the three genes raise this number to 0.5%. These regulatory effects could also contribute to the BMI association signal at chr 16p11.2 in GWAS.",24477,['OBWCCE']
22282663,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>In 2011, there were 225,500 estimated new cases of ovarian cancer worldwide. High-risk mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are responsible for most familial clusters of three or more cases; however, a substantial proportion of familial risk is unexplained. Part of this remaining risk is due to loci which confer moderate risk, such as common, low penetrance alleles identified in recent genome-wide association studies. While characterization of recently confirmed genetic variants is critically important, the search for additional variants continues and includes comprehensive analysis of key candidate pathways.<SEP>Inflammation is a suspected initiator and promoter of ovarian carcinogenesis. Events which delay ovulation and the subsequent inflammatory response are associated with decreased risk of ovarian cancer, consistent with the hypothesis that increased lifetime ovulations create an inflammatory microenvironment promoting tumor growth and suppressing adaptive immunity. The Cancer Genome Atlas has described an immunoreactive subtype of high-grade serous disease characterized by expression of T-cell chemokine ligands CXCL11 and CXCL10 and the receptor CXCR3, and over-expression of receptors of the inflammatory lipoxygenase pathway has been observed. Finally, reduced risk of ovarian cancer has been reported for a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in PTGS2, encoding prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2, or cyclooxygenase, which is thought to be responsible for the prostanoid biosynthesis involved in inflammation and mitogenesis.<SEP>Here, we hypothesize that inherited variants in inflammation-related genes are associated with risk of ovarian cancer and may have subtype-specific risks. Therefore, we examined SNPs in 27 inflammation-related genes in two case-control studies and sought replication in the studies of the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC).","MATERIALS AND METHODS<SEP>Study protocols were approved by the appropriate institutional review board or ethics panel, and all participants provided written informed consent.<SEP>Discovery Analysis<SEP>Participants included 930 epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 1,037 controls who were enrolled at the Mayo Clinic (MAY) and in the North Carolina Ovarian Cancer Study (NCO) (Supplemental Table 1). TagSNPs for ALOX12, ALOX15, ALOX5, CCL11, CCL2, CCL3, CCR3, CRP, CXCL16, IL10, IL15RA, IL18, IL1A, IL1B, IL1RN, IL4R, IL6, IL6R, IL7R, IL8RA, IL8RB, IL9, NOS3, PTGS1, PTGS2, TLR2, and TNF were identified using HapMap CEU data (release 21a, ± 10 kb, MAF ≥ 0.05, r2 ≥ 0.8, Supplemental Table 2). These and non-synonymous SNPs (MAF ≥ 0.05) were genotyped using a custom Illumina GoldenGate™ BeadArray assay; SNPs with call rates below 90% were failed. Logistic regression estimated per-allele risk of ovarian cancer (odds ratios [OR] and 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]) adjusted for site, age, race, region of residence, body mass index, hormone therapy use, oral contraceptive use, parity, and age at first birth, in order to alleviate potential confounding effects.<SEP>Replication Analysis<SEP>Participants were self-reported white women including 3,143 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 2,102 controls enrolled in studies at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), the NCI Ovarian Case-Control Study in Poland (POL), the Tampa Bay Ovarian Cancer Study (TBO), the Familial Ovarian Tumor Study (TOR), and a British collaboration (UK) including the UK Ovarian Cancer Population Study, Studies of Epidemiology and Risk Factors in Cancer Heredity - Ovarian Cancer, the UK Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry, and the Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium (Supplemental Table 3). SNPs with p-value < 0.10 in the discovery analysis described above were assessed using Illumina 317k or 610-Quad arrays, with harmonization of alleles and imputation to HapMap v 26 (www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/) as part of the Follow-up of Ovarian Cancer Genetic Association and Interaction Studies (FOCI) collaboration. Log-additive logistic regression models estimated risk of ovarian cancer adjusted for study site using direct genotype calls or imputed allele dosage values. Combined analysis of discovery and replication data was restricted to self-reported white participants, adjusted for study site, and included tests for heterogeneity between study phases. For SNPs highlighted in combined analysis, we performed regression including multiple SNPs per gene, and we estimated risks by histological subtype using polytomous regression to test for heterogeneity. Finally, among 6,253 combined participants with available age data, we ran analyses with and without age adjustment to assess potential confounding effects. P-values were not adjusted for multiple testing.","RESULTS<SEP>Estimation of ovarian cancer risks associated with minor alleles of SNPs in inflammation-related genes began with analysis of 162 successfully genotyped SNPs in approximately 900 epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 1,000 controls described in Supplemental Table 1. Twenty-one SNPs (in ALOX15, ALOX5, CCL2, CRP, IL18, IL1A, IL1B, IL6, NOS3, and PTGS1) were associated with risk of ovarian cancer with per-allele p’s < 0.10. Two SNPs were associated at p < 0.01: ALOX5 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) rs1864414 (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64–0.92, p=0.004) and NOS3 (nitric oxide synthase 3) rs743507 (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92, p=0.003). Analyses within ALOX12, CCL11, CCL3, CCR3, CXCL16, IL10, IL15RA, IL1RN, IL4R, IL6R, IL7R, IL8RA, IL8RB, IL9, PTGS2, TLR2, and TNF did not suggest associations between genotype and risk of ovarian cancer (p’s > 0.10). Complete results are provided in Supplemental Table 4.<SEP>Twenty-one SNPs with p < 0.10 in discovery analysis were evaluated in an additional approximate 3,100 cases and 2,100 controls described in Supplemental Table 3, and, to enable combined analysis, discovery data were re-analyzed excluding self-reported non-whites and adjusted for only study site. These results and estimates of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r2) are shown in Table 1. Of 21 SNPs in 10 genes, those in IL1A (interleukin 1, alpha) and ALOX5 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) were associated at p-value < 0.01 in combined analysis.<SEP>Two highly-correlated SNPs in IL1A (rs17561 and rs4848300, r2=0.990) yielded essentially identical results, showing associations with decreased risk of ovarian cancer in combined analyses (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.97, p=0.005). Replication analysis yielded p’s < 0.05 (Table 1), and results were consistent between discovery and replication phases (heterogeneity p=0.30; Figure 1). IL1A rs17561 (MAF=0.31) is a missense change (A114S), and rs4848300 (MAF=0.32) resides 3,586 bp from the 3′ end of the gene. As other loosely-correlated IL1A SNPs (r2=0.300) were also associated with ovarian cancer risk (rs3783516 and rs2856838, r2=0.993, OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03–1.18, p=0.01), we attempted logistic regression including all four IL1A SNPs in the combined dataset. However, modeling was uninformative due to convergence issues and unstable parameter estimates.<SEP>Of particular interest, analysis of IL1A rs17561 by histological subtype revealed evidence of heterogeneity (p=0.03, Figure 2). Specifically, an inverse association was present for risk of clear cell subtype (p=0.004), mucinous subtype (p=0.02), and endometrioid subtype (p=0.01), yet absent for risk of the more common (54%) serous subtype (p=0.26). Consistently, the risk estimate for tumors with mixed or unknown histology was intermediate to those for rarer subtypes and serous subtype (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75–1.01, Figure 2).<SEP>In combined analysis, the estimated ovarian cancer risk associated with minor alleles at ALOX5 rs1864414 (MAF=0.18, intron 1), one of the strongest initial discovery set signals, was 0.86 (95% CI 0.79–0.95, p=0.002). Results were consistent between discovery and replication datasets (heterogeneity p=0.71), and, with the exception of POL, risk estimates were less than 1.0 in each study (Figure 1). Because a correlated ALOX5 SNP was also associated with ovarian cancer risk (rs745986, r2=0.651, OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–0.97, p=0.01), we included both SNPs in regression modeling. Results suggested that rs1864414 was driving the association (rs1864414 OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75–1.03, p=0.009; rs745986 OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85–1.14, p=0.11). No heterogeneity by histological subtype was observed (p=0.74)<SEP>As shown in Table 1, combined analyses at IL1B (interleukin 1, beta) rs7596684 and PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1) rs2282169 suggested association with ovarian cancer risk (p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively). Results were null or inconsistent with study phases at SNPs in ALOX15, CCL2, CRP, IL18, and IL6. Among women with available age information, combined analyses adjusting additionally for age yielded similar results at all SNPs.","DISCUSSION<SEP>Chronic inflammation has demonstrated an important role in cancer; tumor microenvironments of numerous cancers, including ovarian, have shown high-levels of inflammatory proteins, such as cytokines, and aberrations in interleukin 1 alpha, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Thus, examinations of genetic variants in these pathways may shed light on inflammation-related carcinogenesis. In the largest study to date, we examined the relationship between SNPs in inflammation-related genes and risk of ovarian cancer using a two-study discovery analysis followed by examination of five studies participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We found that minor alleles at rs17561 and rs4848300 in IL1A and rs1864414 in ALOX5 were consistently inversely associated with risk of ovarian cancer, and, intriguingly, that the IL1A associations were limited to rarer histological subtypes.<SEP>Interleukin 1 alpha is a cytokine which is involved in numerous immune responses and inflammatory processes; it is produced by monocytes and macrophages and released in response to cell injury for the induction of apoptosis. A recent analysis of 4,552 SNPs in cytokines reported that IL1A rs17561 is one of only eight SNPs leading to a predicted intolerable amino acid change, that it is by far the most widely studied cytokine SNP, and that minor alleles here have been “strongly” associated with risk of numerous diseases involving an inflammatory response such as allergic rhinitis, atopy, nasal polyposis, malaria, gingival hyper-inflammatory response, systemic sclerosis, severity of periodontitis, antibody responses to periodontal microbiota and, more recently, ankylosing spondylitis. While we are the first to report an association with ovarian cancer risk, a meta-analysis of prospective breast cancer studies has reported increased risk with IL1A rs17561 (p=0.008) as well as modification of the dose-response relationship between cumulative personal diagnostic radiation and breast cancer risk (interaction p=0.004). Another study of breast cancer risk found that IL1A was the most significant of 232 inflammation genes in gene-level and haplotype analyses (p=4 × 10−4). Of note, a prior ovarian cancer study of approximately 300 participants in total found no association between risk and other SNPs in IL1A; they did not examine rs17561 or rs4848300 and were underpowered to detect associations of the type we observed.<SEP>Epithelial ovarian cancer has several histologic subtypes with characteristic molecular signatures, cytogenetic features, oncologic signaling pathways, and clinical behavior. Nonetheless, for maximal sample size and smaller numbers of tests, molecular epidemiologists have traditionally combined cases and performed subtype analyses only on SNPs associated with risk overall, as we did here. However, our IL1A findings demonstrate that, if multiple rarer subtypes share a common genetic etiology, associations with rarer subtypes (rather than the most common and most studied serous subtype) may drive the result among all cases. These results underscore the need for additional candidate gene or genome-wide studies of clear cell, mucinous, and endometrioid ovarian cancer.<SEP>Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase is a member of the lipoxygenase gene family assisting with conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes, which are important mediators of a number of inflammatory and allergic conditions; it is expressed in the ovarian cancer. Interestingly, we previously reported an association with poorer survival and ALOX5 rs2115819 and rs12264801 among the MAY cases studied here (serous HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.18–2.02, p=0.002; HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.02–1.69, p=0.04, respectively). Even though rs1864414 was not associated with ovarian cancer survival (p=0.23), we evaluated whether the minor allele may be under-represented among cases studied here leading to a false inverse association with risk. We saw no association with rs1864414 genotype and time to enrollment and no difference in risk estimates by mean time of enrollment, and therefore don’t expect that the inverse association reported here is due to survival bias.<SEP>In addition to a large sample size (7,212 participants), strengths of this report include inclusion of numerous genes (most comprehensive to date), use of the tagSNP approach, and independent analyses of discovery and replication datasets. The latter issue requires some consideration. Because false discovery is a concern in SNP association studies, we sought replication of initial results in a large independent dataset. Some argue for the routine analysis of the likelihood of false positive results. With one commonly used method, the IL1A and ALOX5 associations are “noteworthy” (probability of a false positive result < 0.2) only if the prior probability of an association was 0.1 or greater. Of course, choice of the appropriate value for prior probability is a matter of great debate. Some argue that in a discovery-replication study, prior probabilities of association is high, given that significant results were seen in discovery analysis; others argue that in a candidate gene study, biological plausibility is increased. Regardless, additional replication is the key to revealing the “truth” of these associations.<SEP>Limitations of our analyses include lack of genotypic coverage of uncommon variants, assessment of epistasis or gene-environment interactions, and multi-SNP IL1A analysis. Additional genotyping or next generation sequencing efforts are needed to target additional variants, and, due to the need for greater statistical power, larger samples sizes are needed to address uncommon variants as well as interactions. A larger study would also enable simultaneous examination of multiple SNPs in IL1A and the related chromosome 2 cytokine gene cluster. We also note that the boundaries of biological pathways, such as inflammation, continue to evolve; thus expansion of genes from this set of 27 genes will be informative in future efforts. Finally, incorporation of genotype-phenotype studies considering quantification of tumor immune cells, tumor mRNA or protein expression, or inflammatory serum biomarkers into studies of inflammation SNPs will enhance these projects as well.<SEP>In conclusion, SNPs in ALOX5 and IL1A appear to harbor common inherited variants associated with modest differences in risk of ovarian cancer. Efforts to expand current data on inflammation and this deadly disease are a high priority.",15411,['OBWCCE']
24367687,"Introduction<SEP>Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is considered to be a condition that arises from complex etiologies involving multiple factors. The absence of consistent environmental risk factors and the presence of modest familial associations suggest ALL is a complex trait with an underlying genetic component. Although previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and candidate gene approaches have identified susceptibility loci contributing to the genetic basis of ALL, they only explain a small fraction of the heritability. The identification of genetic factors associated with disease is complicated by complex genetic covariance structures and multiple testing issues. Both issues can be resolved with appropriate Bayesian variable selection methods.<SEP>Bayesian variable selection methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in a variety of settings, including those with weakly collinear covariates. Additionally, stochastic search gene suggestion (SSGS) methods combine hierarchical Bayesian models with stochastic search variable selection technology to explore the posterior distribution on the model space to make inferences about the importance of genetic loci.<SEP>SSGS has many qualities that make it a strong candidate for the identification of loci involved in genetic susceptibility. Calibrated priors provide a strong balance of power and false discovery control. The hierarchical nature of the priors for variable selection allows us to easily model the biological structure of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) grouped within genes. Also, many of the studies developing and applying stochastic search variable selection have demonstrated adequate performance when modeling correlated data, such as SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD). The hierarchical nature of the model provides a means to incorporate a priori known covariance structure into the model, which can improve variable selection among multiple predictors. SSGS and other Bayesian variable selection methods model disease risk in a “holistic” manner, jointly considering all SNPs in question, while balancing power and false discovery control, which is important when evaluating high-dimensional data.<SEP>The present study was undertaken to extend our hierarchical Bayesian model for case-parent triads to incorporate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and incorporate the biological grouping of SNPs within genes. This approach uses conditional logistic regression likelihood to model the probability of transmission to an affected child. Additionally, the case-parent triad design provides an advantage to the traditional case-control design as it is immune to population stratification bias. This is because analyses are based on whether the inheritance of alleles by affected children deviates from Mendelian expectation rather than a comparison of genotypes between a case group and a control group. As the folate metabolic pathway is suspected to play an important role in the development of childhood ALL due to its role in the synthesis, repair, and methylation of DNA, we selected 128 tagging SNPs in 16 folate metabolic genes (Table 1), which is an extension of our previous assessment of folate metabolic genes and childhood ALL.","Materials and Methods<SEP>Study Population<SEP>The study population included 118 ALL case-parent triads recruited from the Childhood Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Center at Texas Children’s Hospital (Houston, TX) between 2003 and 2010. Both males and females, and individuals of all racial/ethnic groups were eligible to participate. After written informed consent was obtained from the parent, we obtained a blood sample from each participant. Additionally, saliva samples were collected from parents. Participation of both parents was not required for our analysis. These samples were used to obtain DNA for genotyping. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical records. The study protocol was approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board.<SEP>SNP Selection and Genotyping Methods<SEP>Sixteen genes in the folate metabolic pathway (Table 1) were selected because of their role in DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation. Previous literature was also used in our selection strategy. Tagging SNPs for the 16 genes were selected using an r 2 threshold of 0.80 and the MultiPop-TagSelect Algorithm (due to the multi-ethnic composition of the study population) in the Genome Variation Server, which utilizes information from multiple HapMap populations. SNPs with minor allele frequencies of <10% were not included in the analysis due to the sample size. Based on these criteria, 128 SNPs were available for analysis.<SEP>DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes and saliva using the QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Genotyping was done using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) in the Human Genetics Center at The University of Texas School of Public Health according to the manufacturer’s instructions.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>SSGS was used to analyze the ALL case-parent triad data. SSGS was specifically designed to model genetic case-parent triad data because it combines the conditional logistic regression to model the likelihood of allele transmission from parents to a diseased child with a Bayesian hierarchical model to incorporate genetic structure in variable selection.<SEP>Data Preparation and Post Processing<SEP>To prepare data for analysis using SSGS, we used SimWalk2 to obtain the most likely haplotypes from linkage format data. Maximum likelihood estimators and the covariance matrix of conditional logistic regression coefficients were computed using the clogit command of Stata to provide necessary components for Metroppolis-Hastings sampling within SSGS. We used a modified C/C++ program SSGS to sample from posterior distributions; where we modified the software to incorporate SNP data. The Markov chain output from SSGS was analyzed using the R package Bayesian output analysis (boa) to obtain posterior inference and assess the convergence and stationarity of Markov chains.<SEP>Prior Distributions<SEP>We used a hierarchical prior distribution with two levels to model variable selection: one level for selecting genes and a second level for selecting SNPs within a gene. We assigned both the prior probability of including a gene as 0.5. These values for prior probability of inclusion have been shown to control well for both false positives and false negatives. These prior settings also have the interpretation that every gene has a 50% chance of being associated with the disease and every SNP within a selected gene has a 50% chance of being associated with the disease. The prior distributions of regression coefficients were independent normal distributions with mean 0. The prior settings were chosen to best control for both false positives and false negatives.<SEP>SSGS Analysis<SEP>The SSGS analysis proceeded in two steps. In step 1, we performed SNP screening using SSGS within each chromosome. The 16 genes in the folate metabolism pathway reside on 10 different chromosomes (Table 1). Since LD typically does not span across chromosomes, we first performed independent SSGS analyses for the SNPs on each chromosome. Any SNPs with posterior probability of inclusion greater than 0.2, corresponding to Bayes factor greater than 0.75, proceeded to step 2. We used this threshold for posterior probability of inclusion, recognizing that we wanted to include as many SNPs in the second step as possible, even if the posterior evidence is mildly in favor of non-inclusion. In step 2, all the SNPs selected from step 1 were analyzed simultaneously to identify SNPs associated with childhood ALL. Posterior inference, including odds ratios (ORs) and their 95 percent credible intervals (95% CIs), were calculated for SNPs with Bayes factor greater than 1. For each SSGS analysis, we ran two chains with different initial values for 600,000 iterations and used the last one-third iterations of two chains for pooled posterior inference. All the Markov chains passed the Geweke convergence diagnostic and the Heidelberger-Welch test for stationary using R package boa. In addition, two chains from different initial values for each analysis had high correlations, indicating convergence to the same posterior distribution.","Results<SEP>The population characteristics of childhood ALL cases included in our study were summarized in Table 2. There were 118 cases recruited from Texas Children’s Cancer Center from 2003 to 2010, including 65 males and 53 females. For the study period, the participation rate was 85%. Of the 118 families, 36% were complete triads, however, based on previous assessments this is unlikely to bias the results. The study included individuals of all racial/ethnic groups, 59 non-Hispanic whites, 6 non-Hispanic blacks, 46 Hispanics, and 7 belonging to other racial/ethnic groups. All the cases were under 14 years old when recruited.<SEP>We analyzed 128 tagging SNPs of 16 folate metabolic genes to identify SNPs associated with childhood ALL. The SNPs with posterior probability of inclusion greater than 0.2 in the initial screening within each chromosome proceeded to the final analysis. In the initial screening, 7 SNPs among the 128 tagging SNPs were identified, 2 SNPs in gene MTHFD2, 3 SNPs in gene BHMT2, 1 SNP in gene NOS3, and 1 SNP in gene SLC19A1 (Table 3).<SEP>In the final analysis of 7 selected SNPs from initial screening, NOS3 rs3918186 and SLC19A1 rs1051266 had Bayes factors greater than 1 (Table 4). In other words, the posterior odds of including the two SNPs in the model were greater than the prior odds of including the two SNPs, indicating that our data supported the association between the two SNPs and childhood ALL risk. Specifically, NOS3 rs3918186 had a Bayes Factor of 7.38, whereby for each copy of the minor allele, there was a 2.16 times risk of developing childhood ALL (OR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.51-3.15). We found less evidence in our data for SLC19A1 rs1051266 being associated with childhood ALL. For each copy of the minor allele of SLC19A1 rs1051266, there was a 2.07 times risk of developing childhood ALL (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.25-3.46).","Discussion<SEP>To our knowledge, this is the first application of Bayesian hierarchical models designed for case-parent triads to identify SNPs associated with disease. Previous assessments utilizing this approach have explored microsatellite markers. We extended this method to include the evaluation of SNPs because of the availability of high-dimensional SNP array data for many phenotypes and as case-parent triads are becoming more common in the role of inherited genetic variation on childhood cancer risk. The case-parent triad design provides an advantage to the traditional case-control design as it is immune to population stratification bias. This is because analyses are based on whether the inheritance of alleles by affected children deviates from Mendelian expectation rather than a comparison of genotypes between a case group and a control group. Additionally, the case-parent triad design is useful when appropriate controls are difficult to identify or enroll. Finally, family-based designs often provide greater power than traditional case-control designs.<SEP>In our study, we used SSGS to analyze 128 tagging SNPs in 16 folate metabolic genes to identify associations with childhood ALL risk. Using Bayes factors among this variants in childhood ALL case-parent triads, two SNPs were identified with a Bayes factor greater than 1. There was evidence that the minor alleles of NOS3 rs3918186 and SLC19A1 rs1051266 were positively associated with childhood ALL according to commonly cited guidelines for Bayes Factors. In fact, the minor alleles of each of these SNPs carried twofold increase in risk for childhood ALL.<SEP>Endothelial nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) is responsible for the production of nitric oxide (NO), which modulates homocysteine concentrations by inhibition of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, the enzyme that synthesizes methionine from homocysteine and 5-mTHF. NOS3 rs3918186 is an intronic variant. Nitric oxide and oxidative stress have been suggested as potential mechanisms of childhood leukemogenesis. To our knowledge, this variant has not been assessed in relation to childhood ALL.<SEP>The gene SLC19A1 encodes for reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC-1), which is a transmembrane protein that transports folate across cell membranes, thereby influencing folate levels. The G80A (rs1051266, G>A) polymorphism in RFC-1 is associated with altered folate/antifolate levels. While, to our knowledge, SLC19A1 rs1051266 has not been evaluated for childhood ALL risk, it has been associated with colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. However, a recent assessment by Metayer et al. evaluating SLC19A1, as well as other genes in the folate pathway, used a tagging SNP approach found no association with SNPs in SLC19A1 and childhood ALL.<SEP>The major limitation of this study is the sample size (n = 118), which did not allow us to detect modest associations. In fact, based on this sample size, with a minor allele frequency of 10% (our minor allele frequency inclusion criteria for SNPs), α=0.05, β=0.8, and assuming a log-additive model of inheritance, we had the power to detect an odds ratio of 2.12 based on power calculations using Quanto Version 1.2.5. Our SNP selection strategy may have also affected our ability to identify associations, as we limited our inclusion to those with a minor allele frequency of ≥10%. In other words, we were not able to discover disease associations due to rare variants. Additionally, we were not able to stratify our results by ALL subtypes (e.g., B-lineage or T-lineage), as this information was not available, or age at diagnosis. However, in spite of these limitations, we were able to identify significant associations between folate metabolic variants and childhood ALL using SSGS. An important strength of our study was the use of the case-parent triad design. Additionally the use of SSGS allowed for the control for multiple comparisons, which is important as we evaluated 128 SNPs.<SEP>Our findings are suggestive of the role of inherited genetic variation in the folate metabolic pathway on childhood ALL risk. We believe they also suggest the utility of Bayesian variable selection methods in the context of case-parent triads for evaluating the role of SNPs on disease risk, especially under the circumstances of smaller sample sizes. We identified two potential inherited effects that were undetected in our previous study. Our findings suggest that SSGS can be used to incorporate LD information to identify disease associated SNPs and to appropriately estimate the relative risk coefficients through averaging the posterior distributions. Additionally, as we evaluated 128 SNPs, the use of the priors used here have been shown to control for false positive findings in simulation studies. The use of Bayes factors offers a way to summarize the strength of evidence in our data for specific SNPs, allowing us to prioritize future follow-up investigations. Overall, SSGS provides a useful approach to investigate genetic factors associated with early onset diseases such as childhood ALL.",15458,"['OBWCCE', 'VITMIN']"
24022589,"Introduction<SEP>Many studies have suggested that a Mediterranean diet, as compared to a typical Western diet, may decrease the risk of various chronic diseases including colorectal cancer. Rates of colorectal cancer were very low in Greece and have increased as diet has drifted away from the traditional eating pattern. The traditional Greek diet, relative to a Western diet, had lower intakes of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and red meat, but higher intakes of plant-based foods, fish and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) chiefly from olive oil. The fat content of the Mediterranean diet is of particular interest for colon cancer prevention since in intervention studies increasing fiber alone does not appear to be preventive, and increased intakes of fruit and vegetables have had modest preventive effects. In particular, we hypothesized lower intakes of n-6 linoleic acid and higher intakes of n-3 fatty acids have implications for preventing colon cancer since n-6 fatty acids are metabolized to eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) that is pro-inflammatory in the colon. PGE2 is formed from arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 n-6) by cyclooxygenases in the colonic mucosa, and it plays an important role in colonic crypt cellular expansion and subsequent adenoma formation.<SEP>In addition to the possible effects of dietary intakes, genetic variation in fatty acid desaturase genes has been shown to influence serum and tissue AA concentrations. Delta-5 desaturase (FADS1) and delta-6 desaturase (FADS2) are key desaturase enzymes involved in the synthesis of AA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, n-3) from 18 carbon precursor fatty acids. Dietary intake of AA is low in humans; however, AA comprises between 5–10% of the phospholipids in cells due to elongation and desaturation of linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) to AA.<SEP>Polymorphisms in the FADS1 and FADS2 genes have been identified, and these significantly affect PUFA concentrations in serum. The minor alleles are associated with lower desaturase activity and lower concentrations of AA in blood. Analogous associations for EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have not been consistent across studies, perhaps since certain types of fish can supply high amounts of pre-formed EPA and DHA. Dietary intakes are important to consider since conversion of dietary linolenic acid to longer chain n-3 fatty acids competes with the analogous process for n-6 fatty acids. (In addition to diet, desaturase activity appears to be important in cardiovascular health, and presence of the minor allele in FADS1/2 has been associated with improved measures of blood lipids, C-reactive protein, insulin and fasting glucose. This indicates that lower AA levels are associated with lower pro-inflammatory states. The prevalence of minor alleles appears to have evolved in response to Western diets that are plentiful in n-6 fatty acids, and they are more prevalent in persons of European descent than of African descent.<SEP>Much less research is available on how FADS polymorphisms might affect changes in fatty acids in response to changes in diet, and the available studies have generally focused on n-3 fatty acid supplementation. Flaxseed supplementation, which provides linolenic acid (18:3, n-3), was less effective in increasing EPA concentrations in minor allele carriers of either FADS1 or FADS2, resulting in significant diet by genotype interactions on plasma concentrations of EPA and AA. Dietary n-3 fatty acids also may interact with FADS genotype in affecting concentrations of blood cholesterol and triglycerides, with significant beneficial effects for carriers of all minor alleles being found in some but not all studies.<SEP>The goal of this present study was to assess potential interactions of polymorphisms in FADS1 and FADS2 with changes in diet on levels of arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the serum and in the colonic mucosa of persons at increased risk for colon cancer. This was a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that evaluated changes in fatty acids and carotenoids elicited by six months of intervention with either a Mediterranean or a standard Healthy Eating diet. In that study we observed that dietary changes had little effect on colon fatty acids, which led to the hypothesis that metabolic factors may be limiting for changes in fatty acids. The randomized study obtained both blood and colon biopsies. Here, the relationships of FADS polymorphisms with serum and colonic fatty acid concentrations were evaluated at baseline and after six months of dietary intervention.","Methods<SEP>Study Design and Eligibility<SEP>Details of recruitment and conduct of the Healthy Eating for Colon Cancer Prevention Study have been published previously. The study was approved by the University of Michigan Medical Internal Review Board and was registered at the ClinicalTrials. org (NCT00475722). Briefly, 120 individuals at increased risk of colon cancer gave informed consent and were randomized to follow a modified Mediterranean diet or to Healthy People 2010 diet for 6 months. Blood and colonic mucosal tissue samples were collected at baseline and at 6 months by flexible sigmoidoscopy without prior preparation of the bowels. Blood was drawn after an overnight fast. At baseline, a Health Status Questionnaire was filled out by participants that included health and demographic data. Health information was asked again at 6 months. Dietary data was collected at 0 and 6 months using two days of food records and two 24-hour recalls.<SEP>The decision to genotype subjects with regard to fatty acid desaturases was made after the study began, and consent for genotyping could not be obtained from nine individuals, two of whom completed 6 months of study and seven of whom had dropped out after enrolling. Three samples were not genotyped successfully. The present analysis therefore included 108 of 120 subjects enrolled in the study and randomized to 6 months of counseling for either a Mediterranean or a Healthy Eating diet.<SEP>The frequency of counseling sessions was the same in both study arms. The Healthy Eating diet had dietary goals based on the Healthy People 2010 diet. The goals were to include 2 servings/day of fruit, 3 servings/day of vegetables with at least one of those servings being dark green or orange, 6 servings/day of grains with at least 3 from whole grains, less than 10% of calories from saturated fat and less than 30% of calories from total fat. The Mediterranean diet had goals for consumption of high n-3 foods such as fish or flax at least 2 times a week, consumption of foods in a manner to increase MUFA and decrease n-6 PUFA intakes, 6 servings/day of grains with at least 3 from whole grains, and 7–9 fruits and vegetable servings/day in specified variety.<SEP>Serum and Colonic Fatty Acids<SEP>Fatty acid analysis was performed by gas chromatography with mass spectral detection (GC-MS) of fatty acid methyl esters. Total lipids were extracted from serum using a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol, and 17:0 (1,2-diheptadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was used as the internal standard. For colon tissue, one biopsy of about 5 mg was sufficient for analysis of fatty acids. The biopsy was pulverized in liquid nitrogen, sonicated in 150 μl of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% BHT and 1mM EDTA with an Ultrasonic processor (30 seconds twice), and then total lipids were extracted with 1 ml of chloroform and methanol (1:1). The organic layer in either case was used to prepare fatty acid methyl esters with METH-PREP II derivatization reagent (Alltech, Deerfield, IL). The GC-MS analysis was carried out with A SupelcoSP2330 column, 30m × 0.32mm × 0.2μm film thickness (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), a HP 7673/5971 GC-MS and helium as the carrier gas with a validated assay. The following fatty acids in serum and colon tissue were measured in 12 analytical different batches: 12:0, 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2 (n6), 18:3 (n3), 20:0, 20:1, 20:3 (n6), 20:4 (n6), 20:5 (n3) and 22:6 (n3).<SEP>DNA Extraction and Genotyping<SEP>Many polymorphisms have been identified in the FADS1/2 gene cluster. Haplotypes have been constructed using 3 to 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and AA concentrations were typically about 30% higher in carriers of all major alleles. This literature has indicated that there was little additional benefit from genotyping more than three SNPs, we therefore chose to genotype the three SNPs used in the study of the Rzehak et al.. A subsequent genome-wide association study indicated that another polymorphism in the FADS1/2 region explained 18% of the inter-individual variation in AA concentrations, we therefore added rs174537 to the present analysis.<SEP>DNA was extracted from the buffy coat of heparinized blood samples. The buffy coat had been collected for each blood sample and mixed with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate/1 mM EDTA prior to freezing at −80°C. After all the samples had been collected, they were treated with RNases A and heat-treated RNase T1 followed by digestion with protease K, solvent extraction and precipitation of DNA. The DNA was purified using MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN) to ensure high quality DNA for genotyping. Four SNPs were genotyped; one in the FADS2 gene (rs3834458), two SNPs located in FADS1 (rs174556 and rs174561), and one SNP located in the intragenic region between FADS1 and FADS2 (rs174537).<SEP>Three of the SNPs (rs174556, rs174561, and rs174537) were genotyped using TaqMan SNP Genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems). All assays were done both in real time and post read mode for allelic discrimination on an AB7900 system. The rs3834458 polymorphisms was detected by sequencing. For quality control 10% of all samples were re-genotyped. All plates incorporated positive and negative controls.<SEP>PCR reactions for rs3834458 included 5 μl (20 pmol/μl) of both forward and reverse primers, 12 μl AmpliTaq Gold master mix, 10 μg/μl genomic DNA, and Millipore water for a total volume of 25 μl. Primers used for rs3834458 were 5′-TCCACGATTCCCAAAGAGAC-3′ and 5′-TCTGCAACCTCCCTAGAGACA-3′. Samples were covered in mineral oil, denatured for 10 minutes at 95°C, were passed through 40 cycles of amplification consisting of 1 minute of denaturation at 95°C, 1 minute of primer annealing at 55°C, and 1 minute of elongation at 72°C. The PCR products were checked by running on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide prior to sequencing. Sequencing was done on an ABI 3730 sequencer in the University of Michigan Sequencing Core Facility.<SEP>Statistical Analyses<SEP>The distributions of fatty acid variables were first checked for normality and transformed to approximate normality as needed prior to analyses. The transformations applied prior to analysis are given in the table footnotes, and variables were back transformed to calculate percent increases or differences. Untransformed means are shown in the Tables for ease of interpretation. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the genotypes of each SNP were tested using chi-square tests. Differences in baseline parameters between diet arms were assessed using independent t-tests or chi-square tests, as appropriate (Tables 1 and 2). Genotype data for the four SNPs were summarized to yield the count of minor alleles (the minimum and maximum counts were 0 and 8, respectively). Linear regression was used to evaluate the effect of number of minor alleles on fatty acid concentrations. Subsequently, a binary variable for genotype group was created by the presence/absence of minor alleles, i.e., all major alleles versus one or more minor alleles.<SEP>A linear mixed model was used to evaluate whether the presence of any FADS variant affects baseline fatty acid concentrations (AA, EPA). Each of the baseline fatty acids in both serum and colonic mucosa was regressed on genotype group (Table 2). Batch number was a random effect to account for heterogeneity since fatty acids were measured in different batches. The covariates in the model included age, gender, body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2), and dietary intake measures of n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA and long chain n-3 PUFA (sum of the n-3 fatty acids 20:5, 22:5 and 22:6) as a percentage of energy using 9 kcal/gram.<SEP>Next, we used linear mixed models to evaluate the changes in fatty acid concentrations after 6 months of diet intervention: dietary intake, serum, and colon fatty acid concentrations were regressed on time (baseline, 6 month) with a random intercept for each individual. For serum and colon fatty acids, batch number was included in the random effects. Separate analyses were performed for the two diet groups (Table 3). Finally, analyses were done to compare the changes in fatty acid composition over 6 months between the two diet arms and to assess if the changes were modified by the presence of minor alleles in FADS. For these analyses, each of the outcome variables (AA, EPA for both serum and colonic mucosa) at 6-month follow-up was regressed on genotype group, diet arm, and genotype group*diet assignment interaction by a linear mixed model (Table 4). The model was adjusted for age, BMI, and the concentration of each corresponding fatty acid at baseline. In all the models, batch number was incorporated as a random effect when appropriate. All reported P values were two-tailed. The statistical significance was set α = 0.05 level. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).","Results<SEP>Baseline Characteristics and Genotyping<SEP>The overall study consisted of 108 study participants after exclusions for lack of genotyping consent (n=9) and incomplete genotype data (n=3). Genotyping success rate of the 4 SNPs chosen to define the FADS1/2 haplotype as described in Methods, was between 96.7% and 98.3%. Minor allele frequencies were in the range of 25.0% to 32.9%. The genotype distribution for each SNP did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p >0.05).<SEP>Baseline characteristics for the Healthy Eating diet group (n = 54) and the Mediterranean diet group (n = 54) were summarized in Table 1. No significant differences were found in minor allele frequency of any SNP, gender, race, age, or BMI between the two diet groups at baseline. Likewise, baseline measurements of AA, EPA, and long chain n-3 fatty acids (the sum of EPA and DHA) did not differ significantly in the serum or the colonic mucosa between the two diet groups (Table 1).<SEP>Baseline measures<SEP>Linear regression analysis indicated that the number of minor alleles was a significant predictor of baseline serum AA concentration (p < 0.001) and almost significant for colonic AA concentration (p = 0.058). A greater number of minor alleles was significantly associated with lower AA concentration in serum. Dietary AA intakes were not a significant predictor of either serum of colon concentrations. For long chain n-3 fatty acids, however, the situation was the reverse. Dietary intake of long chain n-3 fatty acids was a significant predictor of baseline serum long chain n-3 concentration (p < 0.001) and colonic long chain n-3 concentration (p = 0.044) while the number of minor alleles was not a significant predictor of either.<SEP>Subsequent analyses were done categorizing subjects into two groups by presence or absence of any minor alleles in the FADS gene cluster. The only dietary or demographic factor to differ by genotype at baseline was BMI, which was lower in carriers of any minor alleles (mean of 27.8, SD 3.7, in all major allele carriers and mean of 26.1, SD 3.6, in carriers of any minor alleles, p=0.02 by the 2-sided t-test). Age was not significantly different (p=0.11) but was retained as a covariate. No significant difference was found for other demographic characteristics (race, gender, smoking, common medication use) between minor allele and all major allele carriers. Results were similar when using any one SNP individually versus all minor SNPS (not shown).<SEP>Serum and colon fatty acid concentrations at baseline by genotype group are shown in Table 2. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate differences between genotype groups. The presence of any minor alleles was highly significantly associated with baseline serum 20:4, n-6 concentrations (p<0.0001) and 18:3, n-3 concentration (p=0.01), and marginally significant for colonic 20:4, n-6 concentration (p = 0.07), with adjustment for age, BMI, and dietary intakes of n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA and/or long chain n-3 PUFA as a percentage of energy. Specifically, mean serum 20:4, n-6 concentration (% of total fatty acids) for minor allele carriers were estimated to be 2% (95% CI = [1%, 3%]) lower, whereas mean serum 18:3, n-3 concentration for minor allele carriers were estimated to be 21% (95% CI = [4%, 41%]) higher, compared to those individuals with all major alleles in the four SNPs in FADS. There was no significant association of genotype with EPA nor with long chain n-3 fatty acids (the sum of EPA and DHA). Genotype group also had no significant effects on total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, insulin, glucose, and CRP with p>0.11 in each case (not shown).<SEP>Effects of Dietary Intervention on Fatty Acid Intakes and Fatty Acid Concentrations in Serum and Colon<SEP>We first evaluated changes in fatty acids by diet group assignment alone without considering the genotype groups. Table 3 displays dietary intakes, serum, and colon fatty acid concentrations for the two diet arms at baseline and after 6 months of intervention. Based on data from food records and 24-hour recalls, dietary intakes of saturated fats (SFA) and monounsaturated fats (MUFA) were significantly reduced (p<0.0001) and long chain n-3 PUFA was significantly increased (p=0.004) in the Healthy Eating group after 6 months. The decrease in mean SFA resulted in an increased polyunsaturated fat: saturated fat ratio from 0.60 to 0.92 in the Healthy Eating group (p=0.008 from mixed linear regression models controlling for age). In the Mediterranean group, dietary intakes of SFA and n-6 PUFA both significantly decreased (p<0.0001), while MUFA and long chain n-3 PUFA significantly increased (p<0.0001), in accord with the counseling goals. The mean polyunsaturated fat: saturated fat ratio increased non-significantly from 0.72 to 0.77 in the Mediterranean group.<SEP>Serum 18:2 n-6 significantly decreased (p=0.02), and both MUFA and n-3 PUFA significantly increased (p=0.0005 and p=0.01, respectively) in the Mediterranean arm only (Table 3). There was little change in colon fatty acid concentrations. The only significant change was for long chain n-3 PUFA that significantly increased in both Healthy Eating (p=0.01) and Mediterranean groups (p=0.01).<SEP>Interactions of Genotype and Diet Intervention<SEP>Figures 1 and 2 show the raw means in each group over time. Table 4 shows the linear mixed model results for the analysis of the genotype by diet interaction. There was a significant interaction of genotype by diet for 20:4, n-6 (AA) concentrations in the colon (p=0.004). No significant genotype-by-diet interactions were found for AA in serum nor for EPA. Among subjects with no minor alleles, mean colon AA concentrations were estimated to be 16% (95% CI = [5%, 26%]) lower for the Mediterranean arm than the Healthy Eating arm at 6 months. These results indicate that after adjusting for baseline AA concentrations, mean colon AA concentrations at 6 months were significantly different between diet arms only in persons with no minor alleles in the FADS1/2 gene cluster. This was mainly due to an increase in colon AA in the Healthy Eating diet arm while colon AA concentrations remained fairly constant in the Mediterranean group.","Discussion<SEP>This randomized, dietary intervention study afforded the opportunity to evaluate the impact of FADS genotype and diet on fatty acid concentrations in both serum and colonic mucosa of individuals at increased risk for colon cancer. The number of minor alleles in the FADS gene cluster, but not diet, predicted serum AA concentrations. This agrees well with results of previous studies, namely that carriers of minor alleles have lower AA concentrations. For EPA concentrations in serum, genotype had no effect while diet did have a significant effect, likely because n3 fatty acid intakes were fairly low and limiting in this study population. It should, however, be noted that diet in this study was assessed using self-report on four separate days. In addition to the possibility of mis-reporting of intakes, those four days might not represent usual intakes over the last month of study and therefore will weaken any apparent associations with diet.<SEP>In epidemiological studies, relatively higher dietary intakes of both n-3 and n-9 fatty acids are thought to be protective while high intakes of n-6 fatty acids increase risk of several cancers including that of the colon. This has been confirmed in experimental models of colon cancer, and low versus high n6 fatty acid diets are associated with decreased tumors and lower production of certain eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In the colon, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been tightly linked with colon cancer risk. Increased n-3 fatty acid intakes also reduce PGE2 production. Interestingly, a reduction in n-6 fatty acid intakes can augment increases in EPA after n-3 fatty acid supplementation. Bartoli et al. observed inhibition of aberrant crypt foci, adenocarcinomas, decreased mucosal arachidonate (20:4) and decreased PGE2 in rats fed either n-9 or n-3 diets relative to rats fed diets high in n-6 fatty acids. The levels of colon mucosal PGE2 were directly proportional to arachidonate levels in the colon in that study. This data makes it important to better understand factors that could affect AA and EPA levels in the human colon.<SEP>Unlike serum fatty acids, genotype had no significant effects on fatty acid concentrations in the colon at baseline (Table 2). It may be the case that serum concentrations of fatty acids are affected by first pass liver metabolism more so than tissues. After absorption of fatty acids, mainly in the small intestine, the liver is the initial site of fatty acid metabolism. The subsequent distribution of fatty acids from the circulation to tissues will be dependent on lipoprotein lipase activity in each tissue site and on tissue-specific metabolic conversions. In a well-controlled study in pigs, increased dietary intakes of linolenic acid and/or linoleic acid significantly affected metabolism of each other to longer chain fatty acids in the liver, but the effect was minimal in brain cortex. In a human lipodomic study, fatty acid desaturase activity of blood reflected activity in the liver but not in adipose tissue. Serum and colon fatty acid concentrations therefore not only diet and genotype, but any tissue-specific regulation of fatty acid metabolism.<SEP>Since the present study was a randomized clinical trial, we then evaluated the effects of the two dietary interventions on changes in fatty acid intakes and levels over time. Both dietary interventions decreased SFA intakes and increased n-3 PUFA intakes. Only the Mediterranean intervention resulted in increased MUFA and decreased n-6 PUFA intakes. Serum fatty acids in the Mediterranean arm reflected these changes in diet (Table 3). In the colon, however, the only significant change was an increase in n-3 PUFA. This indicates that tissue-specific processes may limit the impact of dietary changes in colon fatty acids. The increase in colon n-3 PUFA is interesting, however, since the increases in dietary n-3 PUFA were modest in each diet arm.<SEP>The effect of FADS genotype on fatty acid concentrations in colon was only evident after intervention (Table 4). Study subjects who were carriers of all major alleles and randomized to the Healthy Eating intervention had higher colon AA concentrations after 6 months than subjects with all major alleles in the Mediterranean group. It is not entirely clear why this should be the case, but the Healthy Eating intervention did result in a higher relative amount of n-6 PUFA to other dietary fats. This could have helped increase the percentage of AA in the colon fatty acids after the Healthy Eating intervention. In addition to polymorphisms in FADS, other factors could be operative to affect fatty acid desaturation such as diet-induced changes in the expression and the activity of FADS, and to changes in substrate competition. In carriers of all major alleles randomized to the Mediterranean intervention, AA levels stayed relatively low at both time points and were estimated to be 16% lower than in the Healthy arm after 6 months of intervention.<SEP>Limitations of this study include the small sample size, the relatively short intervention length, and the self-report of diet which is known to be subject to biases. It may take longer for a change in diet to be fully manifest, especially in tissues. In addition, the measurement of fatty acids was done as a percentage of total fatty acids such that increases in one fatty acid on a volume basis would result in decreases in other fatty acids. An additional consideration is that AA concentrations are not easily modifiable by changes in n6 fatty acids in the diet, especially if AA is not elevated at the outset. Strengths of the study include that it was a randomized study, and measures were available before and after diet change in both serum and colonic mucosa of individuals at increased risk for colon cancer.<SEP>In conclusion, this study showed that those subjects with no minor alleles in the FADS1/2 cluster had higher concentrations of AA in serum. Polymorphism in FADS1/2 had no effect on concentrations of EPA, perhaps because concentrations of this fatty acid are more highly driven by dietary intakes. The trends were similar in colon tissue fatty acids but not significant. After randomization to Mediterranean or Healthy Eating intervention for 6 months, there was a significant gene*diet interaction for colon AA concentrations. Subjects who had all major alleles for FADS1/2 had significantly lower AA concentrations in the colon after 6 months if they were in the Mediterranean diet arm. Since AA is the substrate for prostaglandin E2 production, these results indicate that a Mediterranean diet could be especially favorable for reducing colon cancer risk in the subset of subjects with all major alleles in FADS1/2. Future work should evaluate the effects of these FADS polymorphisms on colonic pro-inflammatory states.",26655,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
32060260,"Introduction<SEP>Snoring is the vibration of the upper airway structures that occurs during sleep and creates noise as the air passes in and out while breathing. Habitual snoring is common in the population, its overall prevalence increases with age and is higher in males (35–45%) than females (15–28%). Importantly, snoring is a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by repeated episodes of complete or partial obstructions of the upper airway during sleep, despite the effort to breathe. OSA is usually associated with a reduction in blood oxygen saturation and is often accompanied by associated daytime symptoms, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue and decreased cognitive function. Although the vast majority of patients with OSA exhibit snoring, a minority (20–25%) of patients with central sleep apnoea do not snore and it is estimated that sleep apnoea may occur in as many as 20–40% of the adult population that are snorers, leaving the remaining 60–80% of snorers in the category of habitual non-apnoeic benign snorers. Snoring has previously been associated with body mass index (BMI) as well as with the risk of cardiovascular disease such as coronary heart disease and stroke among postmenopausal women. Twin and family studies have demonstrated the existence of a genetic predisposition to habitual snoring, with heritability estimates suggesting that 18–28% of variance can be accounted for by genetic factors. A proportion of its heritability may be mediated through other heritable lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, which can also contribute to snoring.<SEP>Snoring is known to reduce sleep quality for both snorers and their sleeping partners, reducing energy/vitality and increasing daytime anxiety, risk of depression, stress, fatigue and sleepiness. Here we leverage data from the UK Biobank and an Australian sample of adults, in an effort to characterize the molecular underpinnings of habitual snoring as a complex, polygenic trait. We estimate the prevalence of snoring at 36% and identify phenotypic correlations with BMI, socio-economic status (SES), smoking and alcohol consumption frequency. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identifies 42 genome-wide significant loci and a significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of ~10%. We perform sensitivity analyses, which suggest that the genetic aetiology of snoring is not uniquely driven by BMI genetic factors. We further assess the existence of sex-specific effects, identifying two loci with evidence of differential effect sizes, albeit in the same direction, between males and females. No large-scale sex-specific genetic effects are identified. We also employ statistical genetics methods such as linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression and Mendelian randomization (MR), to identify genetically correlated traits with snoring and assess causality. Sleep-related traits such as sleep apnoea, BMI, cardiometabolic and psychiatric traits are genetically correlated with snoring. MR analyses suggest a potential causal relationship between higher BMI and snoring. Furthermore, we use our GWAS results to estimate individual polygenic scores (PGS) and predict snoring and probable OSA in an independent sample of Australian adults, highlighting the possibility of studying this complex sleep disorder using snoring as a proxy phenotype.","Methods<SEP>Discovery sample and phenotypic information<SEP>Participants included in the present study were of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. Briefly, this resource recruited participants between 2006 and 2010 to assess lifestyle, anthropometric and health-related variables. Participants self-reported on sleep-related traits. Snoring was assessed as a single item (Field-ID: 1210): “Does your partner or a close relative or friend complain about your snoring?” This question could be answered with “Yes”, “No”, “Don’t know”, or “Prefer not to answer”. We excluded participants whose answers were “Don’t know” (n = 29,309) or “Prefer not to answer” (n = 6854) from our analyses (Supplementary Table 3 shows the total sample size for each GWAS, including sensitivity and sex-stratified analyses). OSA cases were determined on the basis of either ICD-10 diagnosis code or self-report of sleep apnoea diagnosis in the UK Biobank.<SEP>Ethical regulations<SEP>The UK Biobank study was approved by the National Health Service National Research Ethics Service (ref. 11/NW/0382) and all participants provided written informed consent to participate in the UK Biobank study. Information about ethics oversight in the UK Biobank can be found at https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ethics/. Regarding the AGDS, all participants provided informed consent prior to participating in the study. This study and all questionnaires used for AGDS were approved by the QIMR Berghofer Human Research Ethics Committee.<SEP>Data extraction and statistical analyses<SEP>Raw data were extracted from the UK Biobank under Application Number 25331. For a description of the field codes and instances used, refer to Supplementary Table 4. Data were re-coded to remove missing data and uninformative responses (e.g., “I don’t know” or “I would rather not answer”). Phenotype-derived estimates such as prevalence and associations between variables were calculated using python. Libraries such as NumPy (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/) and SciPy (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/) were used for descriptive statistics and statsmodels (http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2010/pdfs/seabold.pdf) was used to build logistic regression models to assess correlates of snoring and calculate ORs. Snoring prevalence stratified plots (e.g., Fig. 1) were performed using seaborn v0.9.0. CIs were calculated using a bootstrapping procedure generating 1000 pseudo replicates of the data.<SEP>Genetic association analyses and QC<SEP>Discovery GWAS. Analyses were performed for both the sex-stratified and the full sample using the BOLT-LMM software tool. All GWAS performed were adjusted for age, sex, genotyping array and the first 20 genetic principal components as fixed effects. BOLT-LMM accounts for cryptic relatedness and population stratification. We used a post-GWAS strict QC procedure corresponding to minor allele frequency (MAF ≥ 0.005) and imputation quality (≥0.60).<SEP>Sensitivity analyses. Given the strong correlation between snoring and BMI, we carried out GWAS for snoring using BMI as a covariate (snoring adj. BMI) with BOLT-LMM software with a QC corresponding to MAF ≥ 0.005 and imputation quality (≥0.60).<SEP>Post-GWAS annotation and functional mapping<SEP>SNP annotation was conducted using the FUMA platform. Risk loci are defined as up to 250 kb based on the most right and left SNPs from each LD block. Gene-based tests were performed using Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) as implemented on the FUMA platform, which provides aggregate association p-values based on all variants located within a gene and its regulatory region. We used the GWAS summary statistics to conduct a MAGMA analysis in the FUMA platform (https://fuma.ctglab.nl/). This analysis includes a gene-based test to detect significant SNPs associated with snoring. The prioritized genes based on positional and eQTL mapping were further used to perform gene-set enrichment analysis against the traits available in the GWAS catalogue. Furthermore, we used FUMA to perform tissue-enrichment analysis, based on data from the GTEx project (https://gtexportal.org/home/documentationPage).<SEP>Genetic correlation analyses<SEP>We performed genetic correlation analyses to estimate genetic correlations between the discovery, sensitivity and sex-stratified snoring GWAS summary statistics using LD score regression (LDSC) as implemented in the Complex Trait Genomics Virtual Lab (CTG-VL, http://genoma.io). Further, to uncover genetically correlated traits with snoring, genetic correlation analyses using LDSC were performed on the platforms CTG-VL and LDHub (http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/ldhub/), which aggregate summary statistics for GWAS on hundreds of traits.<SEP>Mendelian randomization<SEP>Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method in which genetic variants (e.g., SNPs) are used as instrumental variables to determine causal relationships between traits, environmental exposures, biomarkers or disease outcomes; to satisfy the conditions for MR, it is not required to identify the actual causal variant, because a marker in LD with the causal variant can serve as a proxy instrument. Moreover, to draw conclusions in regard with casual effects, three relevant assumptions must be taken into consideration: (I) genetic variants must be associated with the exposure of interest; (II) genetic variants must not be confounded; (III) genetic variants must be independent of the outcome through other mechanisms. We used GSMR, an approach that leverages the usage of multiple independent variables (SNPs) strongly associated with the outcome, to overcome these assumptions, as implemented in the CTG -VL (http://genoma.io). We used GSMR to assess causal relationships between snoring and BMI, whole-body fat mass and pulse rate using our results and existing summary statistics for these traits. To avoid possible confounding from sample overlap, we performed GSMR using the summary statistics derived from sex-stratified GWAS. For example, the female snoring GWAS results were used as exposure, whereas the male pulse rate GWAS results were used for the outcome. Finally, sensitivity two-sample MR analyses (MR-Egger, median-weighted estimator, IVW-MR and weighted mode) were performed using the R library MRBase and UK Biobank sex-stratified summary statistics to ensure non-overlapping samples.<SEP>Target sample and polygenic scoring<SEP>To quantify for the cumulative genetic associations for snoring, we calculated PGS using a clumping + thresholding approach. Study description and sample characteristics of the AGDS are available elsewhere. Genotyping was conducted using the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array platform and genotype imputation using the Haplotype Reference Consortium’s reference panel in the Michigan Imputation Server was carried out after performing standard QC procedures. Briefly, for PGS estimation, we excluded indel, strand ambiguous- and low (R2 < 0.6) imputation quality variants. The most significant SNPs were selected using a conservative clumping procedure (PLINK1.9; p1 = 1, p2 = 1, r2 = 0.1, kb = 10,000) to correct for inflation arising from LD. Eight PGS were calculated using different p-value thresholds (p < 5 × 10−8, p < 1 × 10−5, p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.1, p < 0.5, p < 1) as criteria for SNP inclusion on the PGS calculation. PGS were calculated by multiplying the effect size of a given SNP by the imputed number of copies (using dosage probabilities) of the effect allele present in an individual. Finally, the SNP dosage effects were summed across all loci per individual. To assess the association between the PGS and snoring and probable OSA, we employed a logistic regression (python statsmodels). The target sample for snoring was a subset (n = 9026) of the AGDS with data on recent snoring collected through the self-reported item: ‘During the last month, on how many nights or days per week have you had or been told you had loud snoring’. The item for probable OSA was: ‘During the last month, on how many nights or days per week have you had or been told your breathing stops or you choke or struggle for breath’. For both items, a positive response was considered from one to two times per week up to five to seven times per week and the answer ‘Rarely, less than once a week’ was excluded. Only a subset (n ~ 8000) of highly unrelated individuals (genetic relatedness < 0.05) were included in the analyses.<SEP>Reporting summary<SEP>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.","Results<SEP>Snoring prevalence and risk factors<SEP>Our population-based discovery sample consisted of 408,317 individuals of white British ancestry from the UK Biobank. Participants in the sample were deemed as snoring ‘cases’ (37%) based on their report that a partner or housemate had complained to the participant about their snoring (see Methods and Table 1). Snoring was significantly associated with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.011 [per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.009–1.012]) and, to a greater extent, with sex (ORmales = 2.264 [2.212–2.316]). The prevalence of sleep apnoea was higher within the snorer group (Table 1). Furthermore, BMI, SES, smoking frequency and alcohol consumption frequency were also associated with snoring (Fig. 1a). Although snoring prevalence was higher in males, BMI was positively correlated with snoring prevalence in both males and females (Fig. 1b). A lower SES, as determined by both Townsend deprivation index and average household income, was associated with increased snoring in males only. Smoking frequency was positively correlated with snoring prevalence in females and, to a lesser extent, in males (Fig. 1a–c). In contrast, alcohol consumption frequency was correlated with snoring in males and, to a lesser extent, in females (Fig. 1a–d). We further identified other factors such as whole-body fat mass and sleep duration that are correlated with snoring (Supplementary Table 1).<SEP>Discovery GWAS and SNP heritability<SEP>We performed a GWAS study of snoring, taken as a dichotomous variable (n = 408,317; cases ~152,000; controls ~256,000). After quality control (QC; see Methods), 11,010,159 genetic variants remained in the analysis. This uncovered 127 independent genome-wide significant associations across 41 genomic risk loci (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Annotation for the top 15 risk loci is shown in Table 2 and a list of all genomic risk loci is given in Supplementary Data 1. The overall SNP heritability on the liability scale (h2SNP) was 9.9% (SE = 0.39%).<SEP>Genetic correlations<SEP>The trait that showed the highest genetic correlation with habitual snoring was self-reported sleep apnoea (rG = 0.78, SE = 0.17, p-value = 3 × 10−05[ldsc χ2-test]; Supplementary Data 2). We also analysed the genetic correlation between snoring and three measures of overnight oxyhemoglobin saturation: average SpO2, minimum SpO2 saturation and percent of sleep with oxyhemoglobin saturation under 90% (Perc90). Minimum SpO2 and Perc90, which are known proxies for sleep-disordered breathing, but not average SpO2 (which reflects changes in ventilation not necessarily related to sleep apnoea), showed moderate significant genetic correlations with snoring (Fig. 3). Other traits genetically correlated to snoring included BMI, whole-body fat mass, sodium in urine, mood swings, coronary artery disease, alcohol intake frequency, pulse rate, current tobacco smoking, heart disease, lung cancer, the ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), neuroticism, subjective wellbeing and heart rate, among others. Traits showing a negative genetic correlation with snoring included schizophrenia, FVC, FEV1, fluid intelligence score, educational attainment, age at menarche, mean accumbens volume and anorexia nervosa. Overall, traits related to BMI, risk for psychiatric disease, lung function and heart disease were among those with the strongest evidence of association (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 2). Notably, pulse rate, whole-body fat mass and BMI were also phenotypically associated with snoring in this sample (see above and Supplementary Table 1).<SEP>Sensitivity analysis<SEP>We performed two follow-up sensitivity GWAS to explore the effects of BMI, adiposity and nonlinear effects on associated variants. The first sensitivity GWAS included BMI as a covariate, whereas the second included BMI, BMI2, age × sex, age2 and whole-body fat mass. Both sensitivity analyses showed very similar results, with a genetic correlation of 0.9998 (SE = 0.0002). We therefore focus below on the simple model adjusting only for BMI and basic covariates (see Methods). The results revealed 97 genome-wide significant SNPs across 34 genomic risk loci (Fig. 2a) with overall SNP heritability on the liability scale (h2SNP) of 8.67% (SE = 0.39) (Table 3). Although most of the lead SNP effect sizes remained very similar, the signal in the FTO locus showed a strong change after BMI adjustment (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 1). Further, after adjusting for BMI, snoring was no longer genetically correlated with BMI and adiposity-related phenotypes, nor with heart attack, hypertension, alcohol and smoking habits. Traits that remained genetically correlated with snoring after adjusting for BMI included schizophrenia, educational attainment, sodium in urine and sleep-related traits such as daytime dozing, sleep apnoea and excessive daytime sleepiness. Notably, measures of nocturnal hypoxia such as minimum SpO2, average SpO2 and Perc90 showed small increases in their genetic correlation with snoring after adjusting for BMI (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 3). The genetic correlation between both the adjusted and unadjusted GWAS was high (rG = 0.923, SE = 0.003, p-value = 1 × 10−300), suggesting that a considerable amount of snoring predisposition is not fully explained by BMI.<SEP>Positional, eQTL and gene-based test prioritization<SEP>To gain insights into the functional consequences of individual genome-wide significant variants, we used positional and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, as well as genome-wide gene-based association analyses. From positional and eQTL mapping, we identified 149 protein-coding genes mapping to a genome-wide significant SNP. The nearest genes to the top signals included DLEU7 on chromosome 13 and MSRB3 on chromosome 12. In addition to DLEU7 and MSRB3, other compelling genes (prioritized by positional or eQTL mapping) for snoring included BCL11B, FTO, SMG6, ROBO2, NSUN3, SNAP91 and BCL2, which have previously been associated with smoking; BLC11B, FTO, RNA5SP471 and SND1 and NSUN3, previously associated with alcohol consumption; FTO and SND1, associated with coffee consumption; LMO4 associated with insomnia; and RNA5SP471 with narcolepsy. In addition, ROBO2 was previously associated with chronotype and multiple genes (DLEU7, MSRB3, FTO, ANAPC4, SMG6, SND1, SIM1, KCNQ5, CEP120, MACF1, SNAP91 and BCL2) previously associated with musculoskeletal traits such as height and heel bone mineral density (Supplementary Data 1 and  2). Genome-wide gene-based association analysis identified 179 genes associated with snoring beyond genome-wide significance (p < 2.636e − 6; Bonferroni-corrected threshold for 18,971 tested genes) several of which were consistent with the mapped genes. After adjusting for BMI, 104 protein-coding genes were identified mapping to a genome-wide significant SNP from the positional and eQTL mapping, whereas 120 genes remained significantly associated with snoring, including both MSRB3 and DLEU7 (see Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2 and 3). eQTL data obtained from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and mapped with Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (FUMA) highlighted significant SNPs that were associated with the expression of genes in several tissues including the lungs, blood, oesophagus, breast mammary, tibial nerve, and several areas of the brain, such as the cerebellum and hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 2). In summary, many of the mapped genes for snoring have been previously associated with other traits and diseases, primarily grouped into cardiometabolic, cognitive/neurological, respiratory and psychiatric (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 1).<SEP>To further assess whether significant genes converged in functional gene sets and pathways, we conducted gene-set enrichment analyses of tissue expression data (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Genes expressed in blood vessel and tibial artery tissue were associated with snoring, even after adjusting for BMI (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Given these associations, and an observed genetic correlation between snoring and pulse rate (rG = 0.106, SE = 0.03, p-value = 0.001), we conducted a two-sample generalized summary-data-based MR (GSMR) to test for a possible causal relationship. The analysis suggested a one-way causal relationship in which snoring increased pulse rate (Supplementary Fig. 4). We further explored the association between snoring and BMI, whole-body fat mass, blood pressure, major coronary heart disease and heart attack. GSMR results suggested a bidirectional causal relationship, with snoring exerting a causal effect on BMI, but also BMI exerting a causal effect on snoring, and a similar pattern was observed for heart attack. In addition, one-way causal relationships were seen for whole-body fat mass causing snoring and for snoring causing an increase in blood pressure (Supplementary Fig. 4). To control for possible confounding due to sample overlap, we conducted GSMR analyses using sex-stratified GWAS results (see Methods). The results supported causal relationships between BMI (and whole-body fat mass) causing snoring, whereas all other associations did not reach statistical significance after controlling for multiple testing (Supplementary Table 2). We performed further sensitivity analyses using five different MR methods that test different assumptions (Fig. 5). The results of GSMR, inverse variance weighted (IVW-MR) and weighted median analyses supported a causal effect of BMI (and whole-body fat mass) on snoring. Notably, although the MR-Egger estimates did not reach statistical significance, the Egger intercept was not significantly different from zero.<SEP>Sex-stratified GWAS<SEP>Given the higher prevalence of snoring in males, we conducted GWAS analyses stratified by sex. These analyses identified 4 and 25 genome-wide significant SNPs for snoring in males and females, respectively. SNP heritability on the liability scale (h2SNP) was 8.77% (SE = 0.54%) and 12.42% (SE = 0.57%), respectively, for males and females (Table 3). In the sensitivity analyses, SNP heritability (h2SNP) was slightly lower after adjusting for BMI in both males 7.72% (SE = 0.56%) and females 10.85% (SE = 0.54%) (Table 3). We identified two loci (lead SNPs rs199797821 and rs200391180) with a significantly different effect size between sexes, although in the same direction. The cross-sex genetic correlation was high (rG = 0.914, SE = 0.033, p-value = 1.91 × 10−160), and effect sizes and directions for top hits were highly consistent in both the male and female samples (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Fig. 5).<SEP>PGS and prediction on an independent sample<SEP>We used the discovery GWAS summary statistics to derive PGS in an independent target sample from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study (AGDS). The prevalence of self-reported recent snoring was 32%, with a higher prevalence in males than in females (43.2% and 28.1%, respectively). PGS for snoring were significantly associated with recent snoring for all but one (p < = 5e − 8) of the p-value inclusion thresholds (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Participants in the highest snoring PGS decile had around twice the odds of reporting recent snoring and choking or struggling for breath during sleep (i.e., probable OSA; sample prevalence = 8.2%) compared with those on the lowest decile (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, the PGS showed a stronger association with increasing frequency of snoring severity (Fig. 6b). Finally, we showed that the snoring PGS explained a significant amount of variance in recent snoring (Fig. 6c).","Discussion<SEP>This study advances our understanding of the aetiology and genetic architecture of snoring. Overall, snoring prevalence was higher in males than in females, having a strong and positive correlation with BMI, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption in both sexes. The effects of BMI, smoking and alcohol consumption have been previously reported in other studies. In our study, tobacco smoking displayed a stronger association with snoring in females compared with males, a result consistent with observations in an independent sample of ~15,000 Europeans published in 2004. Previous studies provided evidence that women might have a greater susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after smoking and a greater bronchial hyperresponsiveness after methacholine challenge. These results suggest that smoking might be associated with snoring through an increased inflammatory response and irritation of the airways, thus having a larger effect size on females, compared with males. Conversely, our study indicates that the frequency of alcohol consumption has a stronger influence on snoring in males compared with that in females. This is consistent with a previous study that failed to identify an association between alcohol consumption and snoring in females but did so in males. Our results strengthen the evidence pointing to alcohol as a risk factor for snoring and sleep apnoea, potentially through a weakening (relaxation) effect in the jaw and pharyngeal muscles. Our study revealed that lower SES was associated with higher snoring prevalence in males only. Considering that the analysis simultaneously accounted for the effects of BMI, alcohol and tobacco consumption frequency, we speculate that the snoring–SES association might be mediated through factors that are associated with a lower SES and differ between males and females (e.g., work-related exposures). Nonetheless, whether SES is causally associated with snoring in males remains to be assessed. This would require well-powered genetic correlates of SES on independent samples. The differences in risk factor effect sizes between males and females might contribute to the overall observed sex difference in snoring prevalence. Future studies should leverage statistical genetics methods such as polygenic scoring or MR to further characterize the role of SES, smoking and alcohol-related phenotypes in snoring and OSA.<SEP>The sex differences described above motivated us to perform sex-stratified GWAS. The larger sample size of the female subgroup conferred more power to detect genetic associations in our analyses. Notably, we identified a higher snoring SNP-based heritability in females than in males and two loci that displayed statistically significant different effect sizes between sexes. Nonetheless, the observed high cross-sex genetic correlation and a high concordance in effect size and direction among top hits suggest that differences in sex-stratified GWAS might be due to power differences between the male and female subsamples rather than the existence of large-scale sex-specific genetic effects. Future studies should assess whether the loci with evidence of sex-specific effects are mediating the differential effects of SES, alcohol or tobacco consumption frequency between sexes.<SEP>Top genes identified from gene-based test analysis for snoring included DLEU7 and MSRB3. Previous reports have associated DLEU7 with heel bone mineral density, BMI, height, cardiovascular diseases, systolic blood pressure and pulmonary function decline (FEV). The association between snoring genes and heel bone mineral density could be mediated by BMI due to the association between BMI and bone density documented previously. MSRB3 plays a relevant role in protein and lipid metabolism pathways, and has been associated with hippocampal volume, lung function, Alzheimer’s disease, brain injuries, novelty seeking, deafness and height. These results could be consistent with the fact that severe snoring may incur in nocturnal oxygen desaturation, diminishing neuropsychological functions and, in some cases, resulting in tissue damage and contributing to impairment of memory consolidation processes. However, more research is needed to test this hypothesis.<SEP>Genetic correlations between snoring and a variety of traits and diseases were identified. Sleep-related traits, among others, survived the sensitivity analysis adjusting for BMI. It is important to point out that adjustment for a heritable covariate can not only reduce power for estimating genetic correlations or causality estimates, but also introduce collider bias. We have therefore only discussed genetic correlations that existed before adjusting for BMI. The traits with the highest genetic correlation with snoring were sleep apnoea and sleep-disordered breathing phenotypes, which is consistent with loud snoring being a diagnostic criterion for OSA. This observation is also remarkable given the small sample size (<2000 cases) and therefore reduced power (no genome-wide hits) that the GWAS for self-reported sleep apnoea has in the UK Biobank. Our analyses suggest that a GWAS for snoring captures a substantial portion of the genetic contribution to sleep apnoea, highlighting the importance of studying symptoms on a subclinical threshold, an approach that has already proven useful at understanding the heterogeneity of other complex traits such as depression and neuroticism. Our study will enable future efforts aimed at understanding the underlying genetic architecture of OSA using multivariate statistical genetic approaches.<SEP>We also observed moderate correlations with BMI, obesity and whole-body fat mass. Other relevant correlations included lung function, neurological, cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases, and traits such as alcohol consumption frequency and smoking. This is consistent with the observed phenotypic associations on the first part of this study. The high genetic correlation between snoring and snoring adj. BMI (rG = 0.923, SE = 0.003, p-value = 1 × 10−300) supports the idea that the genetic architecture of snoring cannot be explained simply by BMI. Notably, the genetic correlations between snoring and diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, which are considered risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing, do not reach statistical significance. This could imply that the association of atopic diseases and sleep-disordered breathing is not mediated through genetics, but future studies should assess this in a more systematic manner. Our results highlight the importance and utility of studying snoring, and unveil opportunities for understanding highly related sleep traits and disorders, including OSA.<SEP>Our initial MR results using GSMR suggested a mutual causal relationship between BMI and snoring, and a similar pattern was observed for heart attack, but only a one-way causal relationship of whole-body fat mass causing snoring. We hypothesized BMI to be more heterogeneous and potentially more pleiotropic than whole-body fat mass. In fact, MR is known to be confounded by pleiotropy. Interestingly, a one-way causal relationship between snoring and pulse rate, which survived adjustment for BMI, was identified. Nonetheless, this association did not reach statistical significance when accounting for sample overlap (i.e., sex-stratified GSMR) or when using other MR methods that also account for pleiotropy. The only causal associations that survived sample overlap and multiple testing correction were BMI or whole-body fat mass causing snoring. Evidence for a causal association was also observed from methods such as IVW-MR and weighted median MR in addition to GSMR. Using more stringent methods such as MR-Egger, the association did not retain statistical significance. Nonetheless, it is known that MR-Egger is a less powered method. Furthermore, the MR-Egger intercept was not significantly different from zero, thus suggesting that the IVW-MR causality estimate is likely to be unbiased. In addition, GSMR removes pleiotropic instruments using a HEIDI outlier filter and should be unbiased by pleiotropy. Overall, we believe this to be a compelling evidence of a causal effect of BMI on snoring, but caution should be taken given the results from MR-Egger and when extrapolating this observation to other related traits such as OSA. The lower number of instruments available for snoring as an exposure (Supplementary Table 2) makes it hard to assess whether the lack of significant results using snoring as an exposure was due to a lack of power or due to a lack of a true causal effects. Future efforts could leverage novel statistical genetics methods that use all the GWAS results to test whether the associations observed could be explained by a causality rather than pleiotropy.<SEP>Finally, we assessed the validity of our GWAS results by using genetic scoring on an independent sample of Australian adults with data on recent snoring. Our successful prediction of snoring using PGS supports the external validity of our genetic association results. Remarkably, we predicted probable OSA using a snoring-derived PGS. Thus, investigating the aetiology of snoring could also help uncover the aetiology and genetic architecture of OSA, a task that has proved to be difficult and challenging. Future efforts could assess the utility of snoring-derived PGS as an addition to the current battery of tests used to more accurately diagnose OSA, particularly given the issue of potential OSA underdiagnosis.<SEP>Our results highlight the utility of studying snoring and provide important insights into its aetiology and genetic architecture. However, some limitations must be acknowledged. Analyses used self-reported snoring with the item relying on a partner or close friend complaining about the participant’s snoring. Thus, the case definition might be subject to participant-specific recall and subjective biases. Nonetheless, we hypothesize that this limitation might result in the inclusion of some cases as controls (i.e., snoring participants living alone) and therefore bias our results towards the null rather than creating false positives. To avoid confounding due to population stratification, we only included samples of European ancestry in our analyses. This is particularly important, given reports of ethnic differences associated with snoring prevalence. Nonetheless, excluding other populations can limit the generalizability of these results outside the populations studied. As previously discussed, we cannot identify which, if any, sex-specific genetic observations (e.g., differences in SNP heritability) are due to true genetic effects rather than power differences between the samples. Studying the relationship between snoring and craniofacial phenotypes could provide important insights, given that these traits are likely to share a common aetiology. Nonetheless, there is a limited number of available GWAS summary statistics of craniofacial structure phenotypes. Finally, the fact that PGS for snoring predicted less than 1% of the variance on recent snoring suggest that the GWAS is still underpowered. The heritability for snoring in twin studies is estimated in the range of 18–28%, although some of the missing heritability for snoring may come from dominant genetic effects, it is likely that an increased power and studying rare variants yield more powered genetic predictors.<SEP>In summary, we provide insights into the aetiology of snoring, its risk factors and genetic underpinnings. Our observational analyses showed a higher prevalence of snoring in males compared with that in females, and effects of age, BMI, SES smoking and alcohol consumption. In addition, tobacco smoking showed a higher effect on snoring prevalence in females compared with that in males, alcohol consumption displayed a higher effect on snoring prevalence in males compared with that in females and SES seemed to be only associated with snoring in males. GWAS identified 127 genome-wide significant associations across 41 genomic risk loci with h2SNP = 9.9%. We found two loci with differential sex effect sizes, but no evidence for large-scale sex-specific genetic differences. We showed that most of the SNP heritability identified is not simply due to BMI. We also found evidence of a causal relationship from BMI or whole-body fat mass to snoring. Evidence of genetic overlap between snoring and other cardiometabolic, respiratory, neurological and psychiatric traits was found. Finally, we used the GWAS summary statistics to derive individual PGS and predict both recent snoring and probable OSA in an independent sample of Australian adults, thus confirming the relevance of snoring as a sleep-related complex trait. Future studies should aim at leveraging powered GWAS on craniofacial structures, alcohol and tobacco behaviours, to assess whether they are causal of snoring and to assess the amount of shared genetic overlap between OSA and habitual snoring, as the latter may serve to boost the power of obstructive sleep apnoea genetic studies.",36948,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
34578960,"1. Introduction<SEP>Vitamin D has gained a tremendous width of ongoing scientific research during the past two decades. Its undisputed role in bone mineralization has been expanded to a widely adopted hypothesis, associating maternal hypovitaminosis D during pregnancy with an increased risk of the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes and impairment of future offspring’s metabolic health. Mechanistic evidence reported that maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) correlates strongly with neonatal 25(OH)D concentrations at birth. On the other hand, there is a continuing scientific debate and differing criteria of maternal and neonatal vitamin D deficiency worldwide. The main reasons for this wide controversy might implicate individual genetic and regional characteristics, including ethnic variations of vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms, ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and country-specific dietary patterns. The potential influence of the specific genetic background of each individual for decreasing pregnancy complications and optimizing neonatal health could provide a holistic and personalized clinical approach in daily practice and future vitamin D supplementation practices during pregnancy.<SEP>Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) comprises one of the most important factors for vitamin D metabolism. Previous results outline that VDBP metabolism disorders comprise a risk factor for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. These reports vary according to regional and population parameters, including most European countries, with different public health strategies.<SEP>The prevailing view for most eastern European and Mediterranean pregnant populations has been, for decades, that casual exposure to sunlight provides enough vitamin D. Observational data from this region reported a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy. Until recently, there was a paucity of results regarding the effect of maternal and neonatal VDBP polymorphisms on vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy within this region. In addition, so far a combined clinical (in terms of various maternal/neonatal 25(OH) D cut-offs) and genetic (including different maternal and neonatal VDBP polymorphisms) approach has not been investigated.<SEP>We aimed to evaluate the combined effect of maternal and neonatal VDBP polymorphisms and different maternal and neonatal 25(OH) D cut-offs on the profiles of maternal and neonatal vitamin D status, within a sunny region of the Mediterranean basin.","2. Methods<SEP>2.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria<SEP>The study included a cohort of mother–child pairs at birth. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been previously described. Use of vitamin D supplements was also an exclusion criterion. Daily calcium (Ca) supplement use was also recorded. Informed consent was obtained. The study was conducted from January 2018 to September 2018. The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece (approval number 1/19-12-2011).<SEP>2.2. Demographic and Dietary Data—Biochemical and Hormonal Assays<SEP>At enrollment, demographic and social characteristics were recorded. Ca and vitamin D dietary intake during the last month of pregnancy were assessed through a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire that includes 150 food and beverages. From these data, calculations were made for estimations of consumed quantities (in g per day) based on a food composition database, based on the Greek diet for estimating daily dietary Ca and vitamin D intake. Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy was defined either as none (subdivided into never drinking alcohol or drinking alcohol but not during pregnancy), light (1–2 units per week or at any one time during pregnancy) or moderate (3–6 units per week or at any one time during pregnancy).<SEP>Blood samples were obtained from mothers 30–60 min before delivery. Umbilical cord blood was collected, immediately after clamping, from the umbilical vein. Concentrations of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D were determined using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), with lower limits of quantification (LLOQ); 25(OH)D2 (0.5 ng/mL), 25(OH)D (0.5 ng/mL) and the sum of both vitamin D forms is provided as total 25 (OH)D.<SEP>2.3. Neonatal and Maternal Vitamin D Status Cut-Offs and Combined VDBP Polymorphisms Evaluation<SEP>Differences in the frequency of vitamin D status according to neonatal and maternal VDBP polymorphisms were determined according to their vitamin D status at birth: 25(OH)D ≤ 25 nmol/L (deficiency), 25–50 nmol/L (insufficiency) and 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/L (sufficiency). Following this classification, maternal and neonatal VDBP polymorphisms were assessed at birth to investigate potential differences of maternal and neonatal vitamin D status.<SEP>2.4. VDBP Analysis<SEP>DNA isolation was performed by QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Cat. No. 51304, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Genotypes of VDBP rs2298850, rs4588 and rs7041 SNPs were determined by LightSNiP assay using simple probes (LightSNiP, TibMolBiol, Berlin, Germany) and LightCycler Fast Start DNA Master HybProbe Kit (Cat. No.12239272001, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed with LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and genotyping was done by using melting curve analysis as previously described.<SEP>2.5. UVB Measurements<SEP>UVB data for the broad geographical region of Thessaloniki, Greece, were collected at the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics, School of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The daily integral of vitamin D effective UVB radiation (09:00 to16:00 local time) was expressed as the amount of sunlight hitting a horizontal surface, updated every five minutes, in watts per hour square meter (wh/m2). Mean UVB exposure during the previous 45 days (daily integral) before blood sample collection (estimated mean half-life of vitamin D) was calculated.<SEP>2.6. Statistical Analysis<SEP>All analyses that involve the distributions of genotypes of VDBP polymorphisms were analyzed with the chi-square (χ2) test, df:2 for genotypes. Significance was also confirmed with Cramer’s V/Kendall’s tau-c. The comparisons between mean values of the groups were performed with one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison tests, either Tukey HSD or Dunett C, depending on the normality of the data set. Homogeneity of variances was checked with Levene’s Test for homogeneity of variances. When required, the data and p values were adjusted for maternal height (cm), BMI pre-pregnancy (kg/m2), BMI terminal (kg/m2), UVB and weeks of gestation by one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). All data are presented as the mean ± SD in the text and figure legends. p values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. “SPSS 24.0” software was used in these comparisons.","3. Results<SEP>Seventy mother–neonate dyads were initially included. Given four neonates had missing birth biochemical data, they were excluded from the related analysis. Demographic, dietary and biochemical data are presented in Table 1.<SEP>VDBP single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the genotype percentage distributions of mothers and neonates are presented in Table 2.<SEP>3.1. Distribution of Neonatal and Maternal Vitamin D Status According to VDBP Polymorphisms<SEP>Distributions of vitamin D status of maternal–neonatal dyads according to VDBP polymorphisms are presented in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6. Data and p values were adjusted for maternal height (cm), BMI pre-pregnancy (kg/m2), BMI terminal (kg/m2), UVB and weeks of gestation by one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Covariates appearing in the model are evaluated at the following values: BMI pre-pregnancy (kg/m2) = 25.09, BMI terminal (kg/m2) = 29.73 and weeks of gestation = 38.81. No significant difference was observed in any comparisons after adjustment. Mean concentrations of maternal and neonatal vitamin D status (total 25(OH)D), according to maternal and neonatal VDBP polymorphisms, as well as distribution of different states of maternal and neonatal vitamin D equilibrium, were not different among different genotype profiles of VDBP.<SEP>3.2. Neonatal Cut-Offs at Birth (≥50 nmol/L vs. ≤50 nmol/L and ≥25 vs. ≤25 nmol/L), According to Neonatal VDBP Polymorphisms<SEP>Genotype distribution of neonatal VDBP polymorphisms, using different neonatal cut-offs for 25(OH)D at birth, revealed that no significant differences were evident regarding neonatal vitamin D cut-offs of 25 and 50 nmol/L (Table 7).<SEP>3.3. Maternal Vitamin D Status at Birth (Cut-Offs at Birth ≤25 vs. ≥25 nmol/L, ≤50 vs. ≥50 nmol/L and ≥75 nmol/L vs. ≤75 nmol/L) According to Maternal VDBP Polymorphisms<SEP>By comparing the distributions of maternal VDBP polymorphisms and maternal 25(OH)D concentrations with cut-offs at birth, we revealed that mothers with CC genotype for rs2298850 and CC genotype for rs4588 tended to demonstrate higher 25(OH)D (≥75 nmol/L) during delivery (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04, respectively), as viewed in Table 8.<SEP>3.4. Neonatal Vitamin D Status at Birth, According to Maternal VDBP Polymorphisms<SEP>There were no significant differences between neonatal 25(OH)D concentrations, with respect to maternal VDBP genotype distribution, using cut-offs of 25 and 50 nmol/L at birth (Table 9 and Table 10).","4. Discussion<SEP>maternal VDBP polymorphisms do not affect neonatal vitamin D concentrations at birth, in any given internationally adopted maternal or neonatal cut-off for 25(OH)D concentrations;<SEP>neonatal VDBP polymorphisms are not implicated in the regulation of neonatal vitamin D status at birth;<SEP>in a maternal cohort not affected by vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, mothers with CC genotype for rs2298850 and CC genotype for rs4588 tended to demonstrate higher 25(OH)D (≥75 nmol/L) concentrations, after adjustments for biofactors that affect vitamin D equilibrium, including UVB, BMI and weeks of gestation. The fact that this finding was evident in a small cohort implies that a biologically plausible basis, which could explain the profound differences of maternal vitamin D status, was observed in our region, as well as adding to existing genetic influences on maternal hypovitaminosis D during pregnancy.<SEP>Apart from its well-established role as the major plasma carrier protein of vitamin D and its metabolites, VDBP is also considered a critical bioregulator of vitamin D equilibrium during pregnancy. Fluctuations of VDBP concentrations during pregnancy, resulting from adaptive changes on the maternal–neonatal interface, have been reported to exert significant effects on the vitamin D profile. However, the effects of the specific genetic profile of VDBP polymorphisms on maternal–neonatal vitamin D status, based on widely adopted 25(OH)D cut-offs at term, have not been investigated previously in the region of southern Europe. Our results revealed the following:<SEP>Available studies regarding the interplay of VDBP polymorphisms with 25(OH)D concentrations are conflicting. In specific, rs12512631 and rs7041 were found to affect maternal and cord-blood concentrations of 25(OH)D. Insufficient 25(OH)D concentrations were reported in infants of mothers carrying the rs12512631 “C” allele.<SEP>In addition, GC rs2282679 polymorphism was associated with achieved 25(OH)D concentrations after cholecalciferol supplementation and during pregnancy. The minor allele for rs7041 was also associated with higher 25(OH)D and rs4588 was associated with lower 25(OH)D levels during pregnancy, whereas Chinese pregnant women, with VDBP Gc-1f and Gc-1s genotypes, manifested higher plasma 25(OH)D status compared to women with Gc-2.<SEP>VDBP concentrations manifest a variable longitudinal increase during pregnancy, observed only in women with rs7041 GG or GT genotypes. Genetic variations of VDBP polymorphisms could partly explain different supplementation responses during pregnancy, regarding clinical outcomes. Of major interest in a recent cohort with 815 Chinese women, the influence of variants of rs17467825, rs4588, rs2282679 and rs2298850 on maternal 25(OH)D has been reported to be modified by vitamin D supplementation and sunshine exposure. It is interesting to note that significantly higher levels of serum 25(OH)D in homozygous major allele carriers for the rs2298850 of GC gene were also observed in Parkinson’s disease cases with slower progression. It becomes evident that a country-specific clinical approach and a tailored approach, according to specific lifestyle and genetic profiles of pregnant women, could result in a more pragmatic approach, in terms of vitamin D supplementation and prevention of maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.<SEP>This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small and not powered to detect additional differences in other maternal–neonatal cut-offs, but it was sufficiently powered to show significant differences regarding the main aim of the study. Second, the cross-sectional design of the study could not prove a causal relationship. Third, all women were Caucasian, so our results cannot be safely generalized to other ethnicities. On the other hand, the inclusion of both maternal and neonatal polymorphisms, as well as assessment of different cut-offs, could provide a realistic overview of maternal–neonatal dynamics, which is absent in most previous studies of similar design.<SEP>In conclusion, this study, from southern Europe, indicates that maternal and neonatal VDBP polymorphisms do not affect neonatal vitamin D status at birth, whereas mothers with CC genotype for rs2298850 and CC genotype for rs4588 demonstrate higher 25(OH)D concentrations. Future larger studies are required to establish a causative effect of these specific polymorphisms, in the attainment of an adequate (≥75 nmol/L) maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy.<SEP>Publisher’s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",14143,"['OBWCCE', 'VITMIN', 'EATBTS', 'FOODIN']"
27846231,"Introduction<SEP>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder, which is characterized by clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, anovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology (. It affects around 5–18% of reproductive age women, making it the leading cause of infertility in women. Alongside the reproductive abnormalities, PCOS is linked with metabolic disturbances, which include obesity, insulin resistance, altered glucose tolerance, and dyslipidemia. Although the exact pathogenesis of PCOS has yet to be established, there is growing evidence of genetic influences, as seen through familial clustering and twin studies, which showed a 71% concordance in monozygotic twins in one study.<SEP>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is heparin binding, homo-dimeric glycoprotein, which binds to its high affinity receptors on endothelial cells, mediating angiogenesis and vascular permeability, and is secreted by ovarian granulosa lutein cells and theca cells, and uterine endometrium. VEGF plays a critical role in ovarian folliculogenesis and normal reproductive function, highlighted by the findings that women with PCOS had increased serum levels of VEGF, which paralleled increases in Doppler flow velocities within ovarian vessels. High vascularization may result in abnormal growth of the theca interna, the site of androgen steroidogenesis, leading to hyperandrogenism, a hallmark of PCOS. VEGF is encoded by VEGFA gene, which is located on chromosome 6 (6p21.3), and comprises eight exons separated by seven introns. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified within the VEGFA gene, of which some were functional, directly affecting VEGF secretion. These include -2578C/A and -1154G/A (promoter), -583T/C (intron 6), -634G/C and +963C/T (5’-untranslated region), which were linked with decreased VEGF production, whereas -460T/C and +534C/T were associated with higher VEGF secretion.<SEP>Few studies investigated the possible association between VEGFA variants and PCOS and associated features. Two studies conducted on Turkish and South Indian cohort revealed no association between -2578C/A and -460T/C VEGFA SNPs and PCOS. Other studies that investigated the association between VEGFA SNPs and adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, ovarian cancer, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous miscarriage, and cervical cancer yielded mixed results. This study evaluated the association of VEGFA variants with altered VEGF level and PCOS in 382 Bahraini Arab women with PCOS, and 393 age- and ethnically-matched control women.","Subjects and Methods<SEP>Subjects<SEP>This study was done as per the Helsinki Declaration guidelines. Women with PCOS (n = 382) were recruited from adult endocrinology and obstetrics/gynecology outpatient clinics in Manama, Bahrain. In addition, 393 age- and ethnically-matched eumenorrheic university employees and students, as well as healthy volunteers, were included as controls, and were recruited from the five governorates of Bahrain, thus were representative of present-day Bahraini population. Control subjects were examined in the menstrual cycle follicular phase, and their testosterone levels were within range (0.4–3.5 nmol/L). PCOS diagnosis was based on the 2003 Rotterdam Criteria, according to two of three conditions were to be met: ultrasound evidence of polycystic ovary, anovulation, and hyperandrogenism. Subjects were excluded if they had hyperprolactinemia, non-classical adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-producing tumors, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, Cushing's syndrome, and active thyroid disease.<SEP>Additional exclusion criteria body mass index (BMI) extremes (<18 kg/m2 or >45 kg/m2), recent/present illness, and treatment, which affect carbohydrate metabolism or hormonal levels, for three months or longer before inclusion the study. Women using anti-hypertensive, oral contraceptive, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-lowering drugs were excluded. Demographic information, along with detailed personal and family history of diabetes, hypertension, infertility, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease were obtained from all participants. The Bahraini Ministry of Health and Arabian Gulf University Research and Ethics Committees approved the study protocol, and all participants gave written informed consent to participate.<SEP>Biochemical analysis<SEP>Peripheral venous fasting blood samples were obtained at 7:00–9:00 am during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (days 2–5) for control subjects or women with PCOS who did not present with menstrual irregularities (i.e. those diagnosed with PCOS based on hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries), or any day for women with PCOS with menstrual irregularities, after an overnight (> 12 h) fast. Serum samples were analyzed for SHBG by sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); assay sensitivity was 0.01 nmol/ml, and inter-assay and intra-assay precision (CV%) were 5.3% and 4.3%, respectively. Serum LH, FSH, TSH, testosterone, and glucose (ADVIA Centaur, Bayer Vital, Fernwald, Germany), and insulin (IMMULITE 2000, DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim, Germany), were measured by automated chemiluminescence immunoassays. Free (FT) and bioactive (BT) testosterone and free androgen index (FAI) were determined using Free & Bioavailable Testosterone Calculator (www.issam.ch/freetesto.htm). ‬ Insulin resistance (IR) was estimated by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), defined as fasting serum insulin (μIU/ml) × fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬<SEP>Measurement of hs-CRP in plasma samples was done by latex-enhanced nephelometry on a BN II Nephelometer (Dade Behring, Milan, Italy). Samples were assayed in duplicate in each analytical run; the lower limit of detection was 0.15 mg/L, and the assay range was 0.175–11.0 mg/L (initial dilution). Samples were tested in duplicates for IL-6 (Cat. No. D6050), IL-10 (D1000B), and TNFα (Cat. No. DTA00C) levels by sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Assay sensitivity, inter-assay and intra-assay precision (CV%) were 0.7 pg/ml, 4.5% and 2.6% for IL-6, 3.9 pg/ml, 6.7% and 3.4% for IL-10, and 5.5 pg/ml, 7.6%, and 4.9% for TNFα, respectively.<SEP>Serum VEGF Measurement<SEP>Serum was prepared by centrifugation of peripheral venous blood (2000 g, 10 min), and was stored in 200 μl aliquots at or below -40°C. Human VEGF ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used to test for serum VEGF concentration. Assay sensitivity was 9 pg/ml, and intra-assay (4.5–6.7%) and inter-assay (6.2–8.8%) precision (CV %) were within acceptable range.<SEP>VEGFA Genotyping<SEP>VEGFA polymorphisms with minor allelic frequency (MAF) of >5% in Caucasians were selected. Allelic discrimination method (VIC- and FAM-labeled) was used for VEGFA genotyping. Assay-on-demand TaqMan assays were ordered from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA): rs833052 (C_8311577_10), rs1547651 (C__8311590_10), rs699947 (C_8311602_10), rs833061 (C_1647381_10), rs1570360 (C_1647379_10), rs2010963 (C_8311614_10), rs25648 (C_791476_10), rs833068 (C_11400864_10), rs833070 (C_1647373_10), rs3025020 (C_1647366_10), rs3025026 (C_1647362_10), and rs3025039 (C_16198794_10). The reaction was carried out in a 6.3 μl volume according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems), using both StepOne and StepOne Plus real-time PCR system. For quality control, replicate blinded specimens were tested to evaluate genotyping reproducibility; concordance exceeded 99%.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>Statistical analysis was done using SPSS (version. 22.0, IBM). Continuous variables were presented as means (±SD) for, while categorical variables were expressed as percentages of total. Differences in means were assessed by Student’s t-test, while inter–group significance was evaluated by Pearson χ2 test (or Fisher’s exact test for small samples). Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested by Haploview (www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview). Calculation of study power was done by Genetic Power Calculator (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/cgi-bin/cc2k.cgi); the parameters used were 383 women with PCOS and 393 control women, genotypic relative risk for heterozygote (1/2) and minor allele homozygous (2/2), and the MAF for PCOS cases and controls for the seven tested SNPs, and assuming a 14.0% population prevalence of PCOS (unpublished Bahrain Ministry of Health statistics). Assuming these parameters, we calculated the overall power (66.0%) as the average power of the 12 tested SNPs. All analyses were performed under the assumption of additive genetic effect. Haploview was used to check linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs beside their haplotype patterns. VEGFA haplotypes was reconstructed by the expectation maximization method. Taking the control group as reference, regression analysis was used for determination of the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) associated with PCOS risk.<SEP>Haploview analysis<SEP>Limited linkage disequilibrium (LD) was noted between the 12 tested VEGFA variants, of which 9 were found to be in LD, and thus were used in constructing 9-locus haplotypes (Fig 1). Extensive diversity in the haplotype assignment was seen, with common haplotype (>2% of total) seen in 10 of the identified SNPs (64.8% of total haplotypes). The association was tested after controlling for BMI, free and bioactive testosterone, SHBG, free insulin and HOMA-IR. Increased frequency of haplotype CAACAGCGA (P = 0.008) was noted in women with PCOS than control subjects, thus assigning PCOS susceptible nature to this haplotype [OR(95% CI) = 2.91 (1.29–6.88)] (Table 6).","Results<SEP>Study Subjects<SEP>The biochemical and clinical characteristics of women with PCOS and control subjects are presented in Table 1. Comparable age, menarche, waist-hip ratio, along with lipid profile, total testosterone, LH and FSH levels at examination, were seen between women with PCOS and control women. Significant differences between cases and controls were noted for mean BMI (P <0.001), free testosterone (P = 0.009), bioactive testosterone (P = 0.004), free androgen index (FAI; P = 0.015), fasting insulin (P <0.001), and the insulin resistance index HOMA-IR (P <0.001). Significantly lower levels of SHBG (P <0.001), and higher levels of TSH (P = 0.006) (though within reference range) were noted between women with PCOS and controls. Accordingly, we controlled for these covariates in later analysis.<SEP>VEGFA SNPs analysis<SEP>A total of 12 VEGFA SNPs were selected for this analysis based on their established MAFs of >5% in Caucasians. MAFs of the 12 tested VEGFA SNPs between women with PCOS and control women are presented in Table 2. All the SNPs conformed to HWE (P <0.005). MAF of rs3025020 (-583T>C) was higher in women with PCOS than control women (0.34 vs. 0.29; P = 9.0 × 10−4). The MAF of other 11 SNPs were not significantly different between women with PCOS and control subjects.<SEP>VEGFA Genotype distribution<SEP>Significant difference in rs3025020 (-583T>C), and to a lesser extent rs2010963 (-634C>G) genotype distribution was seen between PCOS cases and control women (Table 3). There was enrichment of homozygous minor allele carrying genotypes -583C/C in PCOS cases (0.14 vs. 0.09), and heterozygous -634C/G genotypes in control women (0.48 vs. 0.37) (Table 3). For the remaining variants, comparable distribution of genotypes was seen among women with PCOS and controls. Taking homozygous major allele genotype as reference, increased risk of PCOS was found to be associated with -583T/C [OR (95% CI) = 1.89 (1.09–3.26)], while reduced PCOS risk was seen with only -634C/G [OR (95% CI) = 0.65 (0.44–0.97)] genotypes, thus assigning PCOS susceptibility and protective nature to these genotypes, respectively.<SEP>VEGF serum levels and PCOS features<SEP>Mean serum VEGF levels were significantly increased (P = 0.007), and reduced (P = 0.048) among rs3025020 and rs2010963 genotype carriers, respectively (Table 4). There was progressive increase in fasting insulin (P = 0.033) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.050), and bioactive testosterone (P = 0.042) in rs3025020 genotype carriers. On the other hand, significant reduction in fasting insulin (P = 0.012), free testosterone (P = 0.007) and bioactive testosterone (P = 0.001) in rs2010963 genotype carriers (Table 4).<SEP>Correlation studies<SEP>Correlation analysis were used to investigate the relationship between VEGFA rs30250202 and rs2010963 genotypes and PCOS-associated features; separate analyses were performed for each of the two VEGFA SNPs (Table 5). In the model including rs3025020, carriage of the minor (C) allele was positively associated with hs-CRP. On the other hand, in the model including rs2010963, there was a negative association between the presence of the minor allele (C) with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), but not with hs-CRP. There was no correlation between either rs3025020 or rs2010963 with the extent of obesity or hypertension, with oligomenorrhea, or with altered levels of (anti-inflammatory) IL-10 or (pro-inflammatory) IL-6 and TNFα.","Discussion<SEP>Previous studies that investigated the contribution of VEGF to pathophysiology of PCOS focused on altered secretion/levels of VEGF in women with PCOS, and only few addressed the association between PCOS and VEGFA polymorphisms. We evaluated the association of VEGFA variants with changes in VEGF serum levels, and the presence of PCOS. Of the 12 SNPs analyzed, we documented the positive association of rs3025020 and negative association of rs2010963 with changes in VEGF secretion and the presence of PCOS. Our study also confirmed the association of CAACAGCGA haplotype with increased risk of PCOS. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show such a link between PCOS and the tested VEGFA variants and specific haplotypes.<SEP>All subjects were self-reported Arab Bahraini women, who were consecutively enrolled so as to minimize type II errors. PCOS diagnosis was based on the 2003 Rotterdam Criteria, which allows for inclusion of ultrasound examination findings. By comparison to previous related studies, mean BMI was higher in the studied population, similar to the study on South Indian women, but different from Korean and Turkish studies, which involved lean PCOS cases and control women. This in turn translated into lower testosterone and insulin compared to our study. Accordingly, BMI, free and bioactive testosterone, SHBG, free insulin and HOMA-IR were the main covariates that we controlled for in this study.<SEP>Located on chromosome 6 (6p21.3), the human VEGFA gene consists of eight exons and seven introns spanning 14 kb, and alternate splicing results in the generation of a family of related proteins. Several polymorphisms dispersed throughout the VEGFA gene was reported (NCBI Gene association no: NT 007592), some of which associated with altered VEGF secretion. The latter included the promoter rs833061 (−460T/C), the functional intronic rs3025020 (-583C/T), and 5’-untranslated region rs2010963 (+405G/C), which are relevant to altered VEGF protein expression.<SEP>A strong association between increased serum VEGF levels and PCOS was previously reported, and a correlation between serum VEGF levels and increased ovarian stromal blood flow in women with polycystic ovaries was suggested. In our hands, rs3025020 was associated with increased, while rs2010963 was linked with decreased VEGF secretion, in partial agreement with our previous studies on recurrent spontaneous miscarriage, and sickle cell vasoocclusive crisis. While not tested here, it is likely that SNPs, in particular those localized in promoter and protein encoding regions may modulate transcriptional events. This does not exclude the involvement of intronic SNPs as cis-acting elements in regulating gene expression.<SEP>The association between VEGFA gene polymorphisms and PCOS was reported for Korean, Turkish, and South Indian populations, but with mixed outcome. This was attributed to diversity in sample size, ethnic origin of participants, study designs, diagnostic criteria of PCOS, and statistical methods. Neither rs833061 nor rs699947 were significantly associated with PCOS among Turkish and South Indian women. While none of the 10 “common” VEGFA variants was associated with PCOS in Koreans, the study of Lee on 134 Korean women with PCOS and control women identified +13553C/T (P = 0.033) and +9812 C/T (P = 0.044) to be negatively associated with PCOS. It should be noted that the afore-mentioned study included lean women (BMI: cases = 23.22 ± 3.88 kg/m2, controls = 20.73 ± 2.36 kg/m2), thus questioning the generalizability of the findings.<SEP>In this study, rs3025020 (-583T>C) was significantly associated with PCOS in Bahraini women, evident by the enrichment of its minor allele, and homozygous minor allele-carrying genotypes in women with PCOS. Phenotypically, the rs3025020 (-583T>C) polymorphism correlated to increased levels of VEGF in the serum, with the highest levels seen in homozygote carriers, in agreement with our previous study. To a limited extent, rs2010963 (-634G/C) was also found to be negatively associated with PCOS, which was noted in heterozygous genotype carriers. This suggests a possible susceptible and protective nature of these variants, respectively. The lack of association of the other variants, including rs833061 (-460T/C), rs699947 (-2578C/A), and rs1570360 (-1154G/A), were reminiscent of Korean, Turkish, and South Indian studies. While not tested for its possible association with PCOS, rs3025020 (-583T>C) was previously linked with increased risk of recurrent pregnancy loss in Bahraini and Chinese women. While some of the SNPs included here were previously investigated in relation to other adverse pregnancy complications, including ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome, recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia, ovarian cancer, and cervical cancer with variable results. As such, our finding on its association with PCOS expands the contribution of rs3025020 to adverse pregnancy complications.<SEP>This is the first study to show a significant relationship between the VEGFA rs3025020 (-583T>C) and rs2010963 (-634G/C) variants and PCOS. Our study has some strength points, namely that PCOS cases and control women were ethnically matched, thus minimizing the problems of differences in genetic background, which is inherent in genetic association studies, and that several key covariates were controlled for. However, the study has some limitations, principally due to its retrospective case-control design, which can prompts speculation as to the cause-effect relationship. Another limitation is the relatively small sample size, which prevented subgroup analysis of PCOS case, and that only 12 VEGFA SNPs were analyzed, thus raising the possibility of the contribution of the other VEGFA SNPs (+9812C/T, and +13553C/T) in PCOS pathogenesis. Follow-up studies on populations of related and unrelated ethnic backgrounds, are needed in order to confirm our findings.",19120,['OBWCCE']
20528958,"Introduction<SEP>Several forms of psychopathology, including depression, are characterized by reward dysfunction. Reward processing is influenced by both genes (e.g.,) and stress (e.g.,), but how these factors interactively affect reward processing is largely unknown. Examining putative effects of gene × stress interactions on reward dysfunction might provide important clues about the etiology of depression.<SEP>The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulate the onset and termination, respectively, of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis stress response. Antidepressant medications increase MR expression, which is associated with reduced depressive- and anxiety-like behavior as well reduced corticosterone levels during stressful and basal conditions. Conversely, chronic stress results in reduced MR expression and MR antagonists increase basal and stress-induced cortisol levels and worsen antidepressant response.<SEP>The val allele of the iso/val missense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; Ile180Val, rs5522) within the MR gene (NR3C2) has been associated with (1) heightened endocrine and autonomic responses to acute stress, (2) diminished cortisol-induced MR gene expression, and (3) geriatric depressive symptoms. Based on these findings and the key role of MR in regulating stress responses, the main goal of the current studies was to examine whether MR iso/val genotype and an acute stressor (threat-of-shock) foster, individually and interactively, the emergence of an anhedonic phenotype. We developed two alternative hypotheses.<SEP>First, we hypothesized that val carriers would show elevated reward learning under no-stress conditions, but blunted reward learning under stress. This hypothesis was derived from literature emphasizing an inverted U function between stress and performance, whereby too little or too much stress results in suboptimal function. Of primary relevance here, this inverted U function is believed to be driven by the balance of MR and GR occupancy. Specifically, saturated MR and low GR occupancy results in enhanced synaptic plasticity, ventral striatal neurotransmission, and improved cognition, whereas high MR and GR occupancy is associated with reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits. Given the 10-fold greater affinity of cortisol to MRs, under low stress, MRs are saturated relative to GRs. The heightened stress reactivity and reduced cortisol-induced transactivation characteristic of the val allele suggests that val carriers may have 1) elevated reward learning under no-stress conditions due to high MR saturation and low GR occupancy, and 2) blunted reward learning under stress due to reduced cortisol-induced MR transactivation resulting in saturated MR and GR (Figure 1). Alternatively, because the val allele has been associated with geriatric depressive symptoms, we hypothesized that val carriers might show overall blunted reward learning irrespective of stress manipulation.","Methods and Materials<SEP>Participants<SEP>Study 1<SEP>The final sample consisted of 174 participants (Table 1) recruited from Harvard University and the surrounding community. Participants were excluded if they presented: current medical illness, ADHD, head injury, loss of consciousness, seizures, current alcohol/substance abuse or dependence, smoking, use of psychotropic medications during the last 2 weeks, pregnancy, left handedness. Subjects received $5.00 or course credit for participation and “won” money (average $6.00) during the reward task. A prior paper focusing on event-related potential (ERP) data collected on a sub-sample of these subjects (n = 47) has appeared.<SEP>Study 2<SEP>The final sample consisted of 53 healthy female participants (Table 2). All participants were right-handed, and reported to be of European ancestry (i.e., two parents of European ancestry) and to be free of color blindness, past or present neurological, psychiatric, hormonal, or metabolic disturbances. Only females were recruited because differences in HPA axis system function as well as behavioral responses to stress are theorized to contribute to the two-fold rate of depression found in women relative to men. Only Caucasians were recruited to limit potential confounds of population stratification. [We note that this procedure does not fully exclude the potential for population stratification, which could be addressed through a genomic control analysis; e.g.).] Participants completed two sessions, and were paid $10/hour for their time and “won” $15 during the reward task. A report on this sample focusing on variation across the CRHR1 gene and ERP data collected in this study is in preparation. Across both studies, participants provided written informed consent to procedures approved by the Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research at Harvard University.<SEP>Procedure<SEP>Study 1<SEP>Participants were given instructions and told that the objective of the probabilistic reward task was to win as much money as possible. Following the task, participants completed several questionnaires, including the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), and Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ). At the end of the session, subjects provided a saliva sample for genetic analyses and a Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID) was administered to ensure no past or present Axis I disorder.<SEP>Study 2<SEP>The study consisted of two sessions. In Session 1, the SCID was administered to ensure no past or present Axis I disorder (participants with past minor alcohol abuse, i.e., one symptom meeting threshold more than 2 years ago, were included, n = 2). Eligible participants then completed questionnaires including the MASQ and PSS and provided a saliva sample for DNA analysis.<SEP>In Session 2 (on average, 5.25 days after Session 1; S.D: 4.04), participants performed the probabilistic reward task under a stress (threat-of-shock) and no-stress condition (counterbalanced across subjects). In the stress condition, two electrodes were attached to the back of participants’ right hand, 0.5 cm apart. Prior to the stress condition, shock intensity was adjusted individually; specifically, shocks were administered to participants starting at 0.4 milliamperes and increased in intensity up to 4.0 milliamperes or until a participant defined it as “highly aversive or unpleasant, but not painful.” Participants were instructed that they would receive 1–3 electrical shocks during the stress condition and that the intensity of shocks would increase over time. Additionally, because stressors that are uncontrollable are associated with an enhanced stress response and anhedonic behavior in non-human animals and humans, participants were told that shocks were randomly triggered by the computer and thus unrelated to their performance. For each participant, one shock was administered at the end of block 1. In an effort to maintain stress throughout the experiment, following block 2, the experimenter informed the participant: “I am aware you did not receive a shock during the last block of the task. As a result, it is highly probable that you will receive a shock during the next block.” Prior to the no-stress condition, participants were informed that it was impossible to receive any shocks. Moreover, if the no-stress condition occurred first, the shock device was never introduced into the room; if the no-stress condition was second, the shock device was removed from the room at least 15 minutes prior to the no-stress condition.<SEP>Subjects completed the state forms of the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) four times: immediately before (pre-task) and after (post-task) the stress and no-stress conditions. Post-task questionnaires were modified to ask participants about their mood during the task. Participants were given a 15-minute break following completion of the first task to ensure that mood returned to baseline levels. If a participant’s mood had not returned to baseline, an additional five minutes were provided before the second behavioral task began. Lastly, participants completed the BDI-II. Skin conductance (SC) levels were recorded throughout both task conditions from the distal phalanges of the left index and middle fingers.<SEP>Probabilistic Reward Task<SEP>A probabilistic reward task rooted in signal detection theory was used to measure reward learning, i.e., an individual’s propensity to modulate behavior according to prior reinforcement history. In addition to standard measures of hit rate and reaction time (RT), this task allows for the computation of discriminability, which indexes the ability to perceptually distinguish two stimuli, and response bias, which reflects the participant’s tendency to select one stimulus regardless of actual stimulus presentation. Importantly, unequal frequency of reward following correct identifications of two stimuli produces a systematic preference (response bias) for the response paired more frequently with reward. An asymmetric reward schedule was used to induce a response bias; specifically in each block, correct identification of one stimulus (the “rich” stimulus) was rewarded three times more frequently than the other stimulus (the “lean” stimulus). Response bias, our main variable of interest, was used to objectively assess the modulation of behavior as a function of prior reinforcement history.<SEP>Reward processing can be parsed into distinct neurochemical, neuroanatomical, and psychological components, such as wanting (anticipation), liking (consumption), and the learning of stimulus-reward relationships. The present task provides an empirical measure of reward learning. Of relevance to the current study, reward learning has been found across community, clinical, and student samples to be: 1) blunted in participants with depression; 2) blunted under an acute laboratory stressor; 3) heritable and genetically associated with perceived stress; and influenced by the interaction of corticotroping releasing hormone type 1 receptor (CRHR1) genotype and stress.<SEP>Study 1<SEP>The probabilistic reward task was identical to that described in an independent sample. The task consisted of 300 trials divided into three 100-trial blocks. Each trial began with the presentation of a fixation cross in the middle of the screen for 500 ms. A mouthless cartoon face then appeared for 500 ms before a short (11.00 mm) or long (13.00 mm) mouth was presented for 100 ms. The mouthless face remained on the screen until a response was made. Reward feedback was displayed for 1500 ms on rewarded trials followed by a blank screen for 250 ms; on non-rewarded trials, a blank screen was displayed for 1750 ms. According to the reinforcement schedule, in each block, correct identification of either the short or long stimulus was rewarded (“Correct!! You won 5 cents”) three times more frequently (i.e., 30 vs. 10) than the other stimulus (counterbalanced across subjects).<SEP>Study 2<SEP>The task was similar to that used in Study 1 with the following exceptions. First, because participants completed the task during both a stress and no-stress condition, two different stimuli (mouth and nose) were used as targets (long mouth: 11.00 mm, short mouth: 10.00 mm; long nose: 5.31 mm, short nose: 5.00 mm) to avoid carry-over effects. Second, to minimize participants’ fatigue, each block consisted of 80 trials for a total of 240. Four additional trials (trials 81–84) were appended to the first block in each condition (excluded from analyses). During trial 81 of the stress condition, all participants received a 1-sec shock. For each block, the asymmetrical reinforcement schedule consisted of 24 rewards for the rich stimulus and 8 rewards for the lean stimulus. Third, participants were rewarded with 7.5 cents. Lastly, the fixation cross was presented for 750–900 ms, and the mouthless (or noseless) face following stimulus presentation was left on the screen for 1500 ms.<SEP>Apparatus<SEP>The task was presented on an IBM 2.4-GHz PC using E-prime software (version 1.2; Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Responses were made with a response pad (PST Serial Response Box, Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Shock was delivered via a finger stimulator (Coulbourn Instruments, E13–22, Whitehall, PA, USA) and pre-gelled electrodes (Kendall Foam 4103, Tyco Healthcare Group LP, Mansfield, MA, USA). Psylab hardware (SAM SC5) and software (Psylab8) were used for the collection, measurement, and analysis of SC data (Contact Precision Instruments, Boston, MA). Saliva samples for DNA analyses were collected with Oragene collection kits (OG-250 and OG-100, DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).<SEP>Data Collection and Reduction<SEP>Behavioral Data<SEP>A 2-step procedure was used to identify outlier responses: 1) trials with RTs shorter than 150 ms or longer than 1500 ms were excluded, and 2) for each participant, remaining data were logarithmically transformed and trials with RTs exceeding mean ± 3SD were excluded. Response bias and discriminability were computed as follow (;):  <SEP>Skin Conductance<SEP>Data were recorded at 300 Hz and subsequently resampled at 10 Hz. SC responses were identified with an automated procedure within Psylab software using three data points (onset, slope, and peak). This automated process avoids the accidental detection of an SC response due to noise or movement. The frequency of nonspecific skin conductance responses/minute was computed for each block within each condition.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>DNA obtained from saliva samples was purified, extracted, and hydrated; when not in use, it was stored at −80°C. MR rs5522 primers (F: ACGTTGGATGCTCATGACACATGATA GGGC; R: ACGTTGGATGTTATGTCTGACTCTGGGAGC) were designed using SpectroDESIGNER software (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). Following a polymerase chain reaction, an iPLEX massEXTEND reaction was performed (extension primer: CATGATAGGGCTTTTAACAA). After baseline correction and peak identification, Sequenom SPECTROTYPER software was used to analyze resulting spectra. Genotyping was undertaken in conjunction with several other studies on related topics. rs5522 was the only MR SNP that was typed due to a priori hypotheses.<SEP>Statistics<SEP>Chi-square tests or t-tests were performed to evaluate possible group differences on demographics and self-report measures. For the probabilistic reward task in Study 1, an ANOVA with Genotype and Block (1,2,3) was conducted. For Study 2, an analogous ANOVA with the additional within-subject factor of Condition (stress, no-stress) was run. To assess the effectiveness of the stress manipulation in Study 2, Genotype (iso/iso, val carrier) × Condition (stress, no-stress) × Time (pre-task, post-task) ANOVAs were conducted separately on the STAI and PANAS scores, whereas a Genotype × Condition × Block (1,2,3) ANOVA was conducted on non-specific SC response frequency. T-tests were performed to follow-up significant ANOVA effects.","Results<SEP>Study 1<SEP>Genotype groups did not differ on self-report measures (Table 1). Replicating prior studies in independent samples (e.g.,), participants successfully modulated their behavior according to reinforcement contingencies; for response bias, a main effect of Block emerged [F(2,344) = 4.16, p = .018] driven by higher response bias in Blocks 3 [mean±SD: 0.19±0.23; t(173) = 3.08, p = .002] and 2 [0.15±0.21; t(173) = 1.80, p = .073] compared to Block 1 (0.12±0.19). Critically, a main effect of Genotype was also found [F(1,172) = 4.77, p = .030, Cohen’s d = 0.38] due to higher response bias in val carriers (0.19±0.15) relative to iso homozygotes (0.14±0.15) (Figure 2). The main effect of Genotype was confirmed when considering Caucasian subjects only [F(1,118) = 4.47, p < .04, Cohen’s d = 0.45], suggesting that findings were not confounded by population stratification. For discriminability, only a trend emerged for Block [F(2,344) = 2.86, p = .064], due to higher discriminability in block 3 (0.85±0.28) and 2 (0.85±0.30) relative to block 1 (0.81±0.29), both ps < .06.<SEP>Study 2<SEP>Demographic, self-report, and stress data (Table 2)<SEP>Genotype groups did not differ on any demographic or self-report variables. An independent t-test revealed that group differences in shock intensity approached significance, [t(48) = 1.97, p = .055; Cohen’s d = 0.77]; relative to iso homozygotes (2.31±0.90 milliamperes), val carriers selected a lower level of shock intensity to be highly aversive (1.66±0.47 milliamperes). The ANOVA on STAI scores produced main effects of Condition [F(1,51) = 18.17, p < .001] and Time [F(1,51) = 38.28, p < .001]. These main effects were qualified by a Condition × Time interaction [F(1,51) = 12.90, p = .001; Figure 3A]. Post-hoc tests revealed that, as intended, participants reported significantly higher STAI scores during the stress (44.67±9.70) relative to no-stress (39.39±7.16) condition [t(52) = 4.44, p < .001], whereas no significant differences emerged for the pre-stress assessments [no-stress: 34.51±7.11, stress: 35.46±6.96; t(52) = 1.22, p = .23]. Additionally, for both the stress and no-stress condition, STAI scores significantly increased over the course of the experiment, both ts >5.66, both ps < .001. A Time × Condition × Genotype trend emerged [F(1,51) = 3.89, p = .054], but follow-up t-tests revealed no significant differences between genotypes, all ps > .26.<SEP>For PANAS NA, main effects of Condition [F(1,51) =25.13, p < .001] and Time [F(1,51) = 17.42, p < .001] emerged. A significant Condition × Time interaction qualified these main effects [F(1,51) = 17.11, p < .001; Figure 3B]. Participants reported elevated NA scores during the stress (14.63±4.06) relative to the no-stress (12.09±2.39) condition as well as elevated NA scores prior to the stress (11.81±1.77) relative to the no-stress (11.30±1.41) condition, both ts > 2.25, both ps < .03. Additionally, for both the stress and no-stress condition, NA scores significantly increased over the course of the experiment, both ts > 2.75, both ps < .01. In addition, trends for a Time × Condition × Genotype [F(1,51) = 3.65, p = .062] and Time × Genotype [F(1,51) = 2.95, p = .092] interaction emerged. Independent samples t-tests showed, however, no differences between genotype groups, all ps > .15. For PANAS positive affect, no significant effects emerged, all ps > .21.<SEP>When considering non-specific SC responses, the expected main effect of Condition emerged [F(1,42) = 4.47, p = .04], due to significantly more responses in the stress (4.01±2.58) compared to no-stress (3.32±2.18) condition (Figure 3C). A trending effect for Genotype was observed [F(1,42) = 3.39, p = .07, Cohen’s d = 0.72]; as expected based on prior findings, val carriers (4.56±3.76) had more SC responses than iso homozygotes (2.77±1.91). Collectively, these findings indicate that the stress manipulation was successful; participants reported elevated anxiety and negative affect, and had more non-specific SC responses in the stress relative to no-stress condition. With the exception of a trend for higher skin conductance responses in val carriers, the effects of the stress manipulation were similar across genotypes.<SEP>Probabilistic reward task<SEP>Replicating prior findings, a significant main effect of Condition emerged for response bias [F(1,51) = 6.32, p = .015], due to reduced response bias toward the more frequently rewarded stimulus in the stress (0.02±0.16) relative to no-stress (0.14±0.16) condition (reported in more detail in). Most importantly, this effect was qualified by a Genotype × Condition interaction [F(1,51) = 5.12, p = .028; Figure 4). Relative to iso homozygotes, val carriers had significantly lower response bias in the stress condition [−0.05±0.16 vs. 0.08±0.15; t(51) = 2.27, p = .03, Cohen’s d = 0.89]. No differences emerged within the no-stress [val carrier: 0.18±0.22 vs. iso homozygote: 0.10±0.15; t(51) = 1.41, p = .16, Cohen’s d = 0.55] condition. In addition, within-group analyses indicated that val carriers tended to have lower response bias in the stress relative to no-stress condition [t(7) = 2.29, p = .056, Cohen’s d = 1.22], while iso homozygotes did not differ between conditions [t(44) = 0.33, p = .74]. Figure 4C displays the distribution of response bias in the stress and no-stress condition for iso homozygotes and val carriers; the correlation between stress and no-stress response bias was not significant in either group (iso homozygotes: r = −.27, p = .07; val carriers: r = −.10, p = .82).<SEP>Control analyses<SEP>For discriminability, a main effect of Block emerged [F(2,102) = 3.80, p = .026], due to elevated discriminability in Blocks 3 (0.41±0.02) and 2 (0.40±0.02) relative to Block 1 (0.35±0.02), both ps < .02. Additionally, a Condition × Block × Genotype interaction emerged [F(2,102) = 3.76, p = .027]. Independent t-tests revealed, however, no differences between genotype groups in any block.<SEP>Finally, three sets of hierarchical regressions were conducted to confirm that MR genotype differences in response bias were not confounded by differences in discriminability, shock intensity, skin conductance responses, or other genotypes. In all regressions, possible nuisance variables were entered in the first step, MR genotype was entered in the second step, and the difference in response bias between stress and no-stress was entered as the criterion variable. In the first model, discriminability in both conditions was entered in the first step. In the second, shock intensity and skin conductance responses were entered in the first step. Finally, in the third model, three CRHR1 SNPs (i.e. rs12938031, rs10445364, rs4076452) recently associated with stress-induced reward learning deficits were entered in the first step. Findings confirmed that the val allele still explained unique variance of stress-induced response bias reductions after accounting for (1) discriminability [ΔR2 = .09, ΔF(1,49) = 5.08, p = .03], (2) shock intensity and skin conductance responses in both conditions [ΔR2 = .23, ΔF(1,41) = 12.45, p = .001], and (3) CRHR1 SNPs [ΔR2 = .05, ΔF(1,44) = 3.24, p = .08].","Discussion<SEP>The main goal of the present study was to assess how an acute laboratory stressor (threat-of-shock) and MR genotype independently and interactively affect reward learning. Three main findings emerged. First, replicating prior findings, psychiatrically healthy participants developed a weaker response bias toward a more frequently rewarded stimulus when performing the task under acute stress (reported and discussed in more detail in), which elicited the intended emotional and physiological responses. Second, in both studies, under no-stress conditions, val carriers had enhanced reward learning relative to iso homozygotes, although groups significantly differed only in Study 1. Third, a Genotype × Condition interaction emerged from Study 2: relative to iso homozygotes, val carriers showed significantly lower reward learning under the stress but not no-stress condition; moreover, whereas iso homozygotes performed similarly under the two conditions, val carriers showed lower response bias in the stress relative to no-stress condition. Importantly, analyses controlling for CRHR1 SNPs recently associated with stress-induced anhedonia suggest that MR iso/val genotype contributed to the present findings above and beyond the effects of CRHR1 SNPs.<SEP>Consistent with a wealth of animal literature indicating that stress induces anhedonic behavior, emerging human research suggests that stressors can negatively affect components of reward processing and activation in mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways implicated in reinforcement learning, incentive motivation, and hedonic responses (; Dillon et al., 2009). Interestingly, recent preclinical data show that stress hormones influence dopamine function as well as approach-related behavior raising the possibility that genetic variation in regulators of the HPA-axis may affect reward processing.<SEP>The findings emerging from the current studies identify the MR iso/val polymorphism (rs5522) as an important moderator of reward processing and stress-induced reward learning deficits. Consistent with our primary hypothesis, MR val carriers showed elevated reward learning under basal conditions but were susceptible to stress-induced deficits in reward learning. Critically, these findings emerged in spite of unaffected abilities to perceptually discriminate between the two stimuli, as evidenced by the lack of group differences in the discriminability analyses (see also the hierarchical regression analyses accounting for differences in discriminability), suggesting that response bias findings were not confounded by stress-induced changed in perceptual or attentional processes. Rather, val carriers were less able to modulate their behavior as a function of the asymmetric reinforcement schedule, i.e., were less responsive to rewards under stress.<SEP>Our primary hypothesis was inspired by prior work suggesting an inverted U pattern linking stress and performance, which might be driven by an imbalance of MR and GR occupancy. According to these mechanisms, under basal conditions, val carriers might show heightened reward learning due to high MR occupancy and low GR occupancy leading to enhanced performance. When challenged by even a small amount of stress, however, val allele carriers might be pushed away from the optimal point along the inverted U function (Figure 1) and show relatively higher GR occupancy relative to iso homozygotes, leading to reduced reward learning under stress. Prior findings highlighting reduced cortisol-induced gene expression of the MR and enhanced endocrine and autonomic responses to psychosocial stress in MR val allele carriers are consistent with this interpretation.<SEP>The alternative hypothesis that val carriers would show blunted reward learning irrespective of condition was not supported. It has been suggested that elevated geriatric depressive symptoms in val carriers may be the result of lifelong exposure to elevated cortisol. This interpretation is consonant with sensitization (“kindling”) processes, whereby repeated stressors and depressive episodes lead to changes that leave individuals susceptible or “kindled” to develop later depressive episodes independent of stress. Under this interpretation, the lack of reward deficits under basal conditions in young adult val carriers is not entirely surprising. It is possible that stress is required to elicit reward processing deficits in young val carriers, whereas the life-long accumulated effects of an exaggerated stress response may leave geriatric val carriers susceptible to depressive symptoms. Regardless of the interpretation, the current data suggest that MR val allele carriers are more prone to display anhedonic behavior when exposed to an uncontrollable acute stressor. Whether such deficits might increase their risk for developing depression is currently unknown and warrants further study.<SEP>This report has several limitations. First, neither study evaluated endocrine stress responses; given that MR iso/val genotype moderates endocrine responses to stress, it will be critical to test if heightened endocrine activity is a key mediating factor leading to reduced reward learning. This study was able to address this issue more distally by evaluating skin conductance levels; critically, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that genotype differences in skin conductance levels did not account for reduced reward learning.<SEP>Second, Study 2 is limited by a relatively small sample and limited generalizability given its sole composition of healthy Caucasian females. Thus, the findings from Study 2 are susceptible to type I error and require replication. The small sample size might also have contributed to the finding that, although val carriers show elevated reward learning under no-stress conditions in both studies, the effect was significant only in Study 1 despite a moderate effect size in Study 2 (Cohen’s d = 0.55). The inclusion of psychiatrically healthy participants implies that any interpretation of stress-induced anhedonia with respect to the etiology of depression is entirely speculative. However, the use of a healthy sample provides the advantage of evaluating possible vulnerability factors without the confounding effects of past or current depression, thus eliminating the possibility that any group differences might be the consequence of the disorder. Because most of the participants tested here had not passed the greatest vulnerability period for depression, it is unclear whether the current val carriers might be at increased risk for depression or rather represent a “resilient” group. Longitudinal studies will be required to answer this critical question.<SEP>Third, in light of the importance of MR/GR occupancy ratio for stress responses and coping, research with larger samples will be needed to test possible interactions between MR and GR polymorphisms. Finally, and more importantly, the generalizability and clinical relevance of the current findings await investigations in depressed samples evaluated for naturalistic stressors with contextual measures of life stress (e.g., the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule). Despite these limitations, this report is the first, to our knowledge, to test the effects of the MR iso/val polymorphism and stress on the ability to modulate behavior as a function of rewards. Whether MR iso/val genotype might increase risk for depression through the emergence of stress-induced anhedonia is a testable hypothesis that warrants further investigation.",29905,['OBWCCE']
23704328,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Primary tooth eruption is a complex and highly regulated process through which primary teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Prior to eruption, mononuclear cells move to the dental follicle and fuse to form osteoclasts. These osteoclasts subsequently resorb alveolar bone and in doing so form an eruption pathway through which the primary dentition can then emerge.<SEP>Twin studies have provided insight into the genetic control of primary tooth eruption during childhood. The ‘Dental Development and Oral Health of Australian Twins and Their Families’ was a longitudinal study of 98 sets of twins of European ancestry aged between 1 and 3 years of age that aimed to assess the degree to which variation in tooth eruption was due to genetic factors. Although there was no statistically significant difference in eruption times between zygosity and the sexes, there was strong genetic control with regard to the timing of primary incisor eruption with an estimated heritability of ∼ 82 to 94% in males, and 71 to 96% in females.<SEP>The majority of current knowledge regarding the genetics of tooth eruption and tooth development has been acquired from studies involving transgenic mice and other model organisms, including fish and reptiles, as well as from clinical genetic studies of humans with congenital disorders in which dental abnormalities are a feature. For example, studies in mice have implicated a host of signalling pathways as being critical in proper tooth eruption and development, including those involving the gene families Bmp, Eda, Fgf, Shh and Wnt, among others. These pathways are integrated at several stages of the tooth development process and the network appears to be highly conserved evolutionarily across species. Disruption of these pathways typically results in severe aberrations of dentition, including tooth agenesis or arrest in the early stages of tooth development.<SEP>Population-based genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of tooth eruption in children have the capacity to provide complementary information to these studies, by identifying common genetic variation which is associated with non-pathological differences in the timing of tooth eruption between individuals. Loci implicated by GWASs may not necessarily be the same as those that have been identified in molecular studies or be associated with abnormalities, but rather may reflect variation in genes important in more subtle aspects of tooth development, including differences in the timing of tooth eruption or perhaps even genetic variation important in more generalized aspects of growth and development.<SEP>In a previous genome-wide meta-analysis of primary tooth eruption, we identified five loci associated with ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth’ at 1 year of age at genome-wide levels of significance, and a further five at suggestive levels of significance. Many of these loci contained genes previously implicated in tooth or other organ development. A more recent GWAS of secondary tooth eruption identified two of the same loci as well as two others containing the genes ADK and CACNA1S/TMEM9. What was particularly striking about both studies was the number of loci displaying large effect sizes. Typically, GWASs of quantitative traits require tens of thousands of individuals to identify common variants of small effect. However, the tooth eruption phenotype appears to be influenced by some loci of comparably large effect (i.e. >1% of the phenotypic variance), implying that the genome-wide study of primary tooth eruption might be a powerful strategy not only at detecting variants involved in dentition, but also SNPs that may exert pleiotropic actions on other aspects of growth and development.<SEP>In order to identify novel variants involved in primary tooth eruption, we doubled the size of our previous population-based genome-wide association meta-analysis, increasing our sample to include 5998 and 6609 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) for ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth’, and a further 5403 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC1966). SNPs that met the criteria for genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) were then assessed for association with other related phenotypes, including measures of craniofacial shape and size, secondary tooth eruption, and height. The aim of our study was to (i) identify novel genetic loci associated with tooth eruption, and (ii) to investigate whether variants associated with tooth development exhibited pleiotropic effects on growth in general. Specifically, we examined the relationship between tooth-associated loci and eruption of secondary teeth, height, craniofacial size and shape, as well as possible relationships between known height-associated loci and tooth eruption.","MATERIALS AND METHODS<SEP>Participants and phenotypes<SEP>Genome-wide association analyses of primary tooth eruption variables were based on data collected from two prospective birth cohorts: ALSPAC and NFBC1966.<SEP>ALSPAC<SEP>ALSPAC is a population-based birth cohort study consisting of 14 541 women and their children recruited in the county of Avon, UK, in the early 1990s. Both mothers and children have been extensively followed from the eighth gestational week onwards using a combination of self-reported questionnaires, medical records and physical examinations. Biological samples including DNA have been collected from the participants. Ethical approval was obtained from the ALSPAC Law and Ethics Committee and relevant local ethics committees, and written informed consent provided by all parents. Tooth eruption phenotypes of the children were derived from questionnaires completed by the mothers and included items regarding the ‘age at first tooth’ (assessed at 15months) and the ‘number of teeth’ in the child's mouth (at 15 months).<SEP>NFBC1966<SEP>NFBC1966 followed pregnancies with an expected delivery date in the year 1966 in the Oulu and Lapland provinces of Finland. A total of 5403 samples were available for analysis from NFBC1966. In NFBC1966, ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth’ were gathered by public health professionals during the children's monthly visits to child welfare centres. ‘Age at first tooth’ was recorded as the month of visit at which the first tooth was observed (so that the first tooth could have erupted at any time between the end of the previous month and the recorded month, i.e. ‘interval censoring’). The number of teeth was recorded at 12 months. All aspects of the study were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Oulu and by the respective local research committees. Participants gave written informed consent to be included in the study.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>ALSPAC<SEP>In total, 9912 participants were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping platform by 23andMe subcontracting the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK, and the Laboratory Corporation of America, Burlington, NC, USA. Individuals were excluded from analyses on the basis of excessive or minimal heterozygosity, gender mismatch, individual missingness (>3%), cryptic relatedness as measured by identity by descent (genome-wide IBD >10%) and sample duplication. Individuals were assessed for population stratification using multi-dimensional scaling modelling seeded with HapMap Phase II release 22 reference populations. Individuals of non-European ancestry were removed from further analysis. SNPs with a final call rate of <95%, minor allele frequency (MAF) <1% and evidence of departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (P < 5 × 10−7) were also excluded from analyses. After data cleaning, 5998 and 6609 individuals had complete phenotype and genotype data for the analysis of ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth’, respectively. Individuals were imputed to HapMap Phase II (Build 36, release 22) using the Markov Chain Haplotyping software (MACH v.1.0.16). X chromosome imputation was carried out on the non-pseudo autosomal region of the X chromosome only, using CEU individuals from HapMap Phase III (release 2). Only SNPs exceeding an rsq imputation quality metric of 0.3 and an MAF of >1% were included in subsequent analyses.<SEP>NFBC1966<SEP>The Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo DNA Analysis BeadChip was used for genotyping NFBC1966. SNPs were excluded from the analysis if the call rate in the final sample was <95%, if there was a lack of HWE (P < 5 × 10−4) or if the MAF was <1%; more details of genotyping and quality control procedures can be found in Sabatti et al.. After quality control, 328 077 SNPs were available for imputation. Imputation was carried out using IMPUTEv1 with CEU haplotypes from HapMap Phase II (release 21) as the reference panel. X chromosome imputation was carried out in the non-pseudo-autosomal region of the X chromosome. Only SNPs exceeding an ‘info’ metric of 0.3 and an MAF of >1% were included in subsequent analyses. After data cleaning, 5120 and 4904 individuals had complete phenotype and genotype data for the analysis of ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth’, respectively.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>In order to account for censoring of the data, the association between expected allelic dosage and ‘age at first tooth’ was analysed using parametric survival analysis, with the Gaussian distribution used to model event time. The ALSPAC data were modelled as ‘right censored’, whereas the data in NFBC1966 were modelled as ‘interval censored’. The association between expected allelic dosage and the number of teeth was analysed using proportional odds logistic regression (ordinal regression). Teeth are known to erupt in pairs; hence Poisson regression (which assumes that the events of interest are independent) was not appropriate. Analyses were adjusted for sex (ALSPAC and NFBC1966), gestational age (ALSPAC and NFBC1966) and age of completion (ALSPAC only, all NFBC1966 measurements were recorded at 12 months). In addition, in NFBC1966, the top 10 ancestry-derived principal components were tested for association with the phenotypes and were included in the GWAS of that phenotype if they associated at P < 0.05. This resulted in the inclusion of the second principal component in the NFBC1966 analysis of tooth eruption, and no principal components in the analysis of ‘number of teeth’. Data were analysed using the R software package 2.9.1.<SEP>Results from both studies were combined using a fixed effects inverse variance meta-analysis, using the software package METAL. This approach weights effect size estimates according to the inverse of their standard errors. Variance explained by each SNP was calculated as 1 − var(res.full)/var(res.null)*100 of the model (proportional odds logistic regression/survival regression) with age at measurement, sex and gestational age (var, variance; res, residuals). To correct for over-fitting each individuals, phenotype was estimated from a model that did not include that individual.<SEP>In order to investigate the possibility of secondary signals at loci that met the criteria for genome-wide significance (defined as P < 5 × 10−8), conditional regression analyses were performed conditioning on the most strongly associated SNP in each region. We then applied the Nyholt method for multiple testing correction to derive a threshold for determining statistical significance based on the number of SNPs tested and taking into account LD across the region. These regions were defined based on locations of nearby recombination hot spots. In absence of these, we defined a region as ±250 kb from the top SNP.<SEP>We then investigated whether any of our genome-wide significant loci exerted pleiotropic actions by looking at their association with height, craniofacial shape and size and permanent tooth eruption. In the case of height, we conducted linear regression of height measured at age 17 (in ALSPAC) and age 31 (in NFBC) on genome-wide significant SNPs from Table 1. For craniofacial shape and size, we looked up genome-wide significant SNPs from the present study in the results from a previous GWAS of the 54 variables characterizing different facial features consisting of facial height, width, convexity and prominence of landmark in respect to facial planes (see Supplementary Material, Fig. S4, for a list of distances examined). To account for multiple testing, empirical levels of significance were determined using permutation analyses, where for each SNP, genotype was permuted with respect to the 54 craniofacial variables. In this way, an adjusted P-value could be calculated for each SNP, which took into account the fact that association had been tested across the 54 correlated variables.<SEP>Analyses involving secondary tooth eruption were performed using data from the Danish National Birth Cohort. The genotype data were derived from two on-going GWASs of preterm birth and obesity. The study combined all observations between age 6 and 14 years (starting with the 6th and stopping with the 14th birthday), the time period when eruption of permanent dentition usually occurs. For each visit to the dentist, the total number of permanent teeth (excluding third molars) was recorded, and regressed on age. The resulting residuals were then standardized, and for each individual the mean residual across all available records was used as the phenotype. Genotypes for the two GWASs were imputed separately using MACH. The resulting imputed genotypes were analysed separately and meta-analysed with METAL.<SEP>Pathway analyses of the ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth’ GWASs were performed using the ALIGATOR method. The implementation of ALIGATOR described in Holmans et al. maps genes to gene ontology categories; however, the method is equally applicable to other gene to pathway mappings and we used ALIGATOR to test for the enrichment of significant genes within biological pathways; significant genes are defined by the method as those with one or more SNPs with an association P-value less than a predefined threshold within the gene. We considered 2276 pathways curated by the Broad Institute (), as well as pathways from ‘Pathway Commons’ () and additional inflammatory pathways. All genotyped and imputed SNPs with minor allele frequencies of >0.05 were included in the analyses. The method corrects for variable gene size, and multiple testing of non-independent pathways using permutation. All ALIGATOR analyses used 10 000 simulated replicate gene lists and 2000 simulated replicate studies. We compared results using P-value thresholds for association at 0.005, 0.001 and 0.0005 and 0.0001, and as suggested Holmans et al. report results from the analysis showing the most significant enrichment of pathways.","RESULTS<SEP>A total of 2 446 724 SNPs common to both studies were tested for association with ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth at one year’. All analyses were adjusted for gestational age, sex and age, where appropriate (see Materials and Methods). Results from the two studies were combined using fixed effects inverse variance meta-analysis, where effect size estimates are weighted according to the inverse of their standard errors. Q–Q plots indicated little inflation of the test statistics in the individual cohorts and for the meta-analysis overall (‘Age at first tooth’ LAMBDA ALSPAC = 1.04; ‘Age at first tooth’LAMBDA NFBC1966 = 1.05; LAMBDA META = 1.07; ‘Number of teeth’: LAMBDA ALSPAC = 1.02; LAMBDA NFBC1966 = 1.04; LAMBDA META = 1.06) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). The genomic inflation factor λ is well known to increase with sample size; we, therefore, also calculated λ1000 values for the ‘Age at first tooth’ (λ1000 = 1.01) and ‘Number of teeth’ (λ1000 = 1.00) meta-analyses. Both values are consistent with little latent population stratification or other systematic biases affecting our results.<SEP>We identified 10 loci reaching genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) for ‘age at first tooth’ and a further 11 loci for ‘number of teeth’, giving a total of 15 independent loci (Fig. 1). The full GWAS results corresponding to Figure 1 are available from the Human Molecular Genetics website. Table 1 shows the top-ranking SNPs for each phenotype at each locus. Eight of these loci are novel associations; the top SNPs at these loci are rs17563 (BMP4), rs10740993 (CACNB2), rs4937076 (CDON), rs1799922 (CALU/OPN1SW), rs997154 (AJUBA/C14orf93), rs7924176 (ADK), rs412000 (TEX14/RAD51C) and rs9316505 (DLEU7). Four of the loci identified confirm previously reported genes/regions (KCNJ2, MSRB3, IGF2BP1 and EDA). Furthermore, we detected genome-wide significance for the variant rs17101923 in the HMGA2 region (‘number of teeth’ P = 1.1 × 10−10, Table 1), rs10932688 in the 2q35 region and the rs6568401 variant in the 6q21 region, which were identified at suggestive levels of significance in a previous study. We also note that SNPs at the RAD51L1 locus reported as genome-wide significant for association with ‘number of teeth’ in Pillas et al. did not meet the 5 × 10−8 threshold in this study, although there was still suggestive evidence for association at this locus [‘Age at first tooth’ (rs17105278): P = 2.1 × 10−6; ‘Number of teeth’(rs1956529): P = 6.4 × 10−7].  <SEP>Each SNP that reached genome-wide significance explained only a small fraction of the overall phenotypic variation in ‘age at first tooth’ (0.05–1.14%, ALSPAC; 0.06–1.45%, NFBC1966) and ‘number of teeth’ (0.09–0.94%, ALSPAC; 0.03–0.92%, NFBC1966). Pooling together the effects of the top SNPs at the genome-wide significant loci (Table 1) into a single allelic score explained 6.06% of the overall phenotypic variation in ‘age at first tooth’ and 4.76% of the variation in ‘number of teeth’. We also report loci displaying suggestive levels of association (Supplementary Material, Tables S1 and S2), 5 × 10−6 > P > 5 × 10−8, which included SNPs in the TMEM9 region that were reported as genome-wide significant in the study of secondary dentition by Geller et al..<SEP>Supplementary Material, Figures S2 and S3 show LocusZoom plots of regression analyses for ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth’, respectively, at each genome-wide significant locus after meta-analysis. For most loci, there appeared to be evidence of secondary signals independent of the lead SNP at the locus. To quantify the evidence for independent secondary signals, we first calculated the effective number of statistical tests in each region using Nyholt's procedure. For each locus, we estimated the threshold for a family-wise error rate of 5% by dividing alpha = 0.05 by the corresponding number of effective tests in that region, and used this threshold for declaring a secondary signal as significant. These thresholds as well as the strongest P-value in each region after conditioning on the lead SNP are presented in Supplementary Material, Table S3. These analyses showed that there were likely to be independent secondary signals at rs11077486 (KCNJ2 KCNJ160), rs2520397 (FAM155E–EDA), rs1951867 (BMP4), rs1472259 (HMGA2) and rs8069452 (IGF2BP1) for ‘age at first tooth’ and rs9788982 (KCNJ2 KCNJ160), rs2804391 (FAM155E–EDA), rs1458991 (BMP4), rs9894411 (IGF2BP1), rs1976274 (MSRB3) and rs1472259 (HMGA2) for ‘number of teeth’ (Supplementary Material, Table S3).<SEP>We next investigated whether the SNPs at our top loci have pleiotropic effects, specifically whether they are associated with both primary tooth and craniofacial development. A recent GWAS investigated the genetic determinants of 54 measures of craniofacial shape and size recorded in ALSPAC (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). We used these data to test for association between the top SNPs at genome-wide significance and each of the 54 measures of craniofacial development. Because of the large number of correlated craniofacial phenotypes analysed, and consequently the large number of statistical tests performed, we calculated empirical P-values for each SNP permuting each genotype against the 54 phenotypes. This procedure is less conservative than a Bonferroni correction (which assumes that the phenotypes are independent) and ensures that the correlation between phenotypes is properly accounted for in the multiple testing correction. Empirical P-values were calculated for each SNP and those with P < 0.05 were declared significant (Table 2). Using this procedure, we identified three SNPs, which were associated with 10 of the 54 craniofacial measures. Specifically, the SNP rs17101923 (HMGA2) was associated with measurements indexing the width of the upper region of the face and nose (Table 2 and Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Alleles that were associated with increased face width were associated with increased number of teeth and earlier tooth eruption. The rs7924176 marker (ADK) was also associated with measures indexing the width of the nose. Alleles that predisposed to earlier tooth eruption were also associated with a wider nose. Furthermore, rs997154 (AJUBA) was associated with an increase in height and prominence of the mid-brow. <SEP>We also looked up the top SNP from each of the 15 genome-wide significant loci in a previous analysis of secondary dentition and found that 7 were at least nominally associated (P < 0.05) with the number of permanent teeth between 6 and 14 years old (Supplementary Material, Table S4). For the three loci (i.e. HMGA2, BMP4, MSRB3) associated with ‘age at first tooth’ at genome-wide significance, the allele associated with earlier primary tooth eruption was also associated with a greater number of permanent teeth. Furthermore at the four loci (ADK/VCL/AP3M1, 2q35, CACNB2, 6q21) associated with ‘number of primary teeth’, the allele associated with a greater number of teeth at 1 year was also the allele associated with greater number of permanent teeth (6–14 years).<SEP>In order to explore the connection between known height-associated SNPs and teeth phenotypes more deeply, we took 180 robustly associated height variants from the Lango Allen et al. Giant Consortium meta-analysis and examined the degree to which these SNPs were associated with tooth eruption (Supplementary Material, Table S5). Several height-associated SNPs showed strong evidence of association with tooth eruption in the expected direction (i.e. the height increaser allele was associated with faster tooth eruption/more teeth), including rs1351394 in HMGA2 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 5.3 × 10−7; ‘Number of teeth’: P = 1.0 × 10−9), rs12534093 in IGF2BP3 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 0.0026; ‘Number of teeth’: P = 2.7 × 10−5), rs1490384 near C6orf173 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 1.0 × 10−7; ‘Number of teeth’: P = 0.12) and rs1570106 in RAD51L1 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 0.00012; ‘Number of teeth’: 2.3 × 10−6). Overall, however, the number of height-associated SNPs for which the height increaser allele had a positive effect on faster tooth eruption was not greater than expected by chance (‘Age at first tooth’: 89/180 SNPs in the expected direction P = 0.94; ‘Number of teeth’: 92/180 SNPs in the expected direction P = 0.71). Likewise, a weighted allelic score of height-associated SNPs did not significantly predict the age at first tooth or the number of teeth (‘Age at first tooth’: PMETA = 0.18; ‘Number of teeth’: PMETA = 0.44).<SEP>We also regressed height at 17 years in ALSPAC and at 31 years in NFBC1966 on an allelic score constructed from the genome-wide significant SNPs for ‘Age at first tooth’ and ‘Number of teeth’ listed in Table 1. Allelic scores for ‘Age at first tooth’ (PMETA = 0.0012) and ‘Number of teeth’ (PMETA = 9.8 × 10−4) showed moderate evidence of association with height; however, the associations appeared to be driven largely by variants in HMGA2 and BMP4. After these SNPS were removed from the construction of the scores, the evidence for association attenuated markedly (‘Age at first tooth’ PMETA = 0.11; ‘Number of teeth’ PMETA = 0.04).<SEP>Finally, we conducted a pathway analysis using the ALLIGATOR software. In the pathway analyses, an SNP association P-value threshold of 0.005 gave the most significant over-representation of genes in pathways in the ‘age at first tooth’ GWAS (see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Material, Table S6a). The top 20 pathways (of the 2276 considered) from this analysis are shown in Table 3; 11 of these pathways had pathway association P-values <0.001 and the P-value associated with this degree of overrepresentation is 0.004 (Supplementary Material, Table S6A). However, none of the association P-value thresholds applied to the ‘number of teeth’ GWAS resulted in a significant over-representation of pathways (Supplementary Material, Table S6B). In Discussion, we focus on the results from the ‘age at first tooth’ GWAS. ","DISCUSSION<SEP>We report genetic variants at 15 loci associated with primary tooth eruption at genome-wide significant levels, including 8 novel variants within or near the following genes: BMP4, CACNB2, CDON, CALU/OPN1SW, AJUBA, DLEU7, TEX14/RAD51C and ADK. We confirm association with six loci previously associated with primary tooth eruption (KCNJ2/KCNJ16, EDA, IGF2BP1, MSRB3, Chr6q21, 2q35). The SNPs from the ADK and 2q35 associations have also been previously associated with secondary tooth eruption.<SEP>Two genes identified in this study that have been implicated repeatedly in animal and human models of tooth development are BMP4 and EDA. BMP4 is a member of the transforming growth factor beta-1 superfamily of secretory signalling molecules that play essential roles in embryonic development, including mesoderm induction, tooth development, limb formation, bone induction and fracture repair. Mutations in BMP4 can cause eye, brain and digit developmental anomalies. BMP4 is expressed early in tooth development and has an expression profile which coincides with the shift of odontogenic potential from the epithelium to the mesenchyme during development of the tooth bud. Recent data suggest that BMP4 signalling suppresses tooth developmental inhibitors in the tooth mesenchyme, including Dkk2 and Osr2, and synergizes with Msx1 to activate mesenchymal odontogenic potential for tooth morphogenesis and sequential tooth formation. Given BMP4's important role in tooth development, it is perhaps not surprising that SNPs at this locus also associate with timing of tooth eruption. Interestingly, variants within BMP4 have previously been associated with Parkinson's disease and colorectal cancer in other GWASs suggesting pleiotropic actions of this gene.<SEP>EDA is a member of the tumour necrosis factor family that signals through a receptor expressed locally in the placodes of all ectodermal appendages as well as in primary and secondary enamel knots. In humans, mutations in the gene encoding EDA can cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia-1. This syndrome is characterized by a variety of ectodermal abnormalities, including missing teeth and defects in tooth morphology in that crowns of the remaining teeth lack cusps and are conical in shape. The ‘Tabby’ mouse (i.e. EDA null mutant mouse) represents the murine equivalent of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia-1. These mice often lack incisors and third molars and typically express simplified tooth morphology, including missing or fused cusps. Conversely, mice that overexpress EDA in the epithelium develop an extra tooth in front of the molars. The EDA locus was implicated in our previous GWA study of tooth eruption in humans. Our results confirm that SNPs at this locus are also associated with subtle effects on tooth development, including alterations in the timing of tooth eruption.<SEP>CACNB2 (rs10740993) is a member of the voltage-gated calcium channel superfamily, and the third ion channel gene to be implicated in tooth eruption. Mutations in CACNB2 have been implicated in a form of Brugada syndrome, a genetic disease characterized by electrocardiogram abnormalities. Variants in the gene have also been associated with hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in GWASs. Interestingly, the top SNP from the present study is in LD (r2 > 0.7) with an SNP associated with blood pressure from the Ehret et al. study; the allele associated with earlier tooth eruption is on the same haplotype as the allele associated with lower blood pressure.<SEP>Variants in DLEU7 have also been associated with height in three GWASs, although the LD between the topmost SNPs from these studies and the topmost SNP from the present study is low (r2 < 0.01), suggesting that the underlying signals are independent of each other. Transcription factors of DLEU7 are known to have roles in cell proliferation and differentiation.<SEP>CDON (rs4937076) is involved in muscle cell differentiation and cell adhesion. This gene is part of a cell-surface receptor complex that mediates cell–cell interactions. Cell adhesion molecules have been implicated in several processes, including cell migration, growth control and tumour genesis. Cole and Krauss generated mice lacking CDON, 60% of which failed to survive beyond weaning at postpartum day 21. CDON−/− mice displayed the hallmark facial defects associated with microforms of holoprosencephaly, including lack of or solitary central maxillary incisors.<SEP>CALU (rs1799922) is a calcium-binding protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is involved in protein folding and sorting. The gene has no known functions related to tooth eruption, and variants within this gene have not been associated with other phenotypes in GWASs.<SEP>AJUBA belongs to a group of cell adhesion complexes. It is involved in cell fate determination and is an important regulator of the WNT signalling pathway. As well as being associated with the number of teeth at 12 months/15 months, the variant rs997154 was also associated with G-men distance (i.e. distance from the glabella to the mid-endocanthion point), suggesting that this gene might be pleiotropically involved in other aspects of craniofacial development besides dentition.<SEP>SNPs at three loci (HMGA2, ADK and AJUBA) showed evidence of association with craniofacial distances, particularly those indexing facial width. The SNP rs17101923 is located in an intron of the gene HMGA2 which is known to contain genetic variants associated with height, head circumference, intracranial volume and permanent dentition. The top variant from our study (rs17101923) is in moderate to high LD with these genetic variants, which could reflect the pleiotropic action on growth, in general, of a single causal variant. Ligon et al. report the case of an 8-year-old boy with a de novo pericentric inversion of chromosome 12 that truncated the HMGA2 gene. The patient exhibited multiple clinical features, including premature dentition, enlarged and supernumerary teeth, as well as macrocephaly, flat supraorbital ridges, widely spaced eyes and prominent alveolar ridges. Our results suggest that common SNPs at this locus can also contribute to normal variation in the timing of tooth eruption and craniofacial distances.<SEP>We examined the degree to which known height SNPs were associated with tooth eruption, and similarly whether SNPs associated with tooth eruption explained variance in height. Our analyses suggest there exists a subset of known height-associated variants, including those in the HMGA2, IGF2BP3, C6orf173 and RAD51L1 loci that are also associated with tooth eruption. This may be due to these variants exerting a generalized pleiotropic effect on many aspects of growth. For example, SNPs in HMGA2 have been previously associated with other growth-related phenotypes, including head circumference, intracranial volume and birth weight as well as height. Likewise, SNPs at the C6orf173 locus have been associated with age at menarche. Despite robust associations of a few, the majority of height-related SNPs were not strongly related to tooth eruption. A weighted allelic score of height-associated variants was not strongly related to tooth eruption and there seemed to be little consistency in the direction of allelic effects for 180 height-associated SNPs across height and tooth eruption phenotypes. Likewise, the majority of genome-wide significant tooth eruption SNPs did not appear to be strongly related to height. The exceptions were SNPs in HMGA2 and BMP4, both which appear to have pleiotropic actions that have been discussed previously. Our results suggest that BMP4 is likely to contain novel height-associated variants and could also be followed up in this context.<SEP>The RAD51 family of genes encode a strand-transfer protein which is thought to be involved in recombinational repair of DNA damage and in meiotic recombination; variants in two of these genes have been highlighted in this study. A variant near RAD51C was genome-wide significant for tooth eruption; this gene has been implicated in a Fanconi anaemia-like disorder as well as in rare monogenic forms of breast and ovarian cancer, but not in tooth development. Further, a variant in RAD51L1 reported in Lango Allen et al. as being associated with height also showed suggestive evidence of association with primary tooth eruption in this study.<SEP>The top 20 pathways identified from the pathway analysis are mostly related to growth and/or cancer. The three genes (BMP4, CDON, IGF2BP1) associated with ‘age at first tooth’ in the GWAS meta-analysis are part of the hedgehog-signalling pathway (P = 5 × 10−4), signalling events mediated by the Hedgehog family (P < 10−4) and glypican pathway (P = 4 × 10−4). Hedgehog signalling has been well described in tooth development, along with heparan sulphate proteoglycans. Growth factors also play a major role in the interaction between dental epithelium and mesenchyme, as well as cell–cell interactions within these tissues during tooth development. Several growth factor receptor signalling pathways for the epidermal growth factor receptor and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor were significant in our analysis [signalling events mediated by the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) P < 6 × 10−4, EGF receptor (ErbB1) signalling pathway, internalization of ErbB1, ErbB1 downstream signalling, P < 0.0019], which is of interest as their ligands HGF and EGF have been shown to play a role in root development in mice.<SEP>Of the four loci associated with primary tooth development in Pillas et al. and confirmed in this study, three have known developmental functions: KCNJ2, EDA and IGF2BP1. The link between normal development and cancer has been noted previously, with both involving shifts between cell proliferation and differentiation. Five of the 15 loci identified by our study have been implicated in cancer. As noted earlier, rare mutations in RAD51C have been implicated in breast and ovarian cancer. Likewise, a variant in BMP4 has been found to be associated with colorectal cancer; also a variant in 2q35 has been found to be associated with breast cancer. In both cases, the reported SNP is in high LD with the lead SNP at the respective locus in our study and was also associated with primary tooth eruption. However, whereas the allele associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer was associated with earlier time to tooth eruption, the allele associated with increased risk of breast cancer was associated with fewer teeth at 12 months. Expression of HMGA2 has been implicated in bladder and lung cancers. Expression of IGF II mRNA-binding protein produced by IGF2BP1 has been implicated in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the pathway analysis implicated many pathways associated with cancer.<SEP>In summary, we have identified eight new loci affecting primary tooth eruption, which together with previously identified loci explain 6.06% of the variation in ‘age of first tooth’ and 4.76% of the variation in ‘number of teeth’. These estimates compare favourably with larger studies on human height; for example, using a total sample size of 39 509, Gudbjartsson et al. discovered 27 loci associated with human height, which together explained 3.7% of the variation in human height. Several of these variants also appear to exhibit pleiotropic actions, including effects on craniofacial development, height and potentially on disease development in later life. Furthermore, we report a number of genes belonging to pathways involved in growth/development and cancer. A thorough understanding of how the functional variants underlying these associations mediate their effects is likely to yield rich rewards not only in terms of understanding tooth eruption and craniofacial development, but also potentially about how disease develops across the life course.",36781,['OBWCCE']
25607885,"Introduction<SEP>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are characterized by chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation and disorganized immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract. Although IBD pathogenesis is incompletely understood, mucosal T-helper type 17 (Th17) cells play a key pathologic role. Th17 induction is supported by IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23 and TGF-β, cytokines that upregulate and stabilize retinoic acid receptor-related organ receptor (RORγT) and pro-inflammatory function.<SEP>The cytokine IL-10 preserves gastrointestinal homeostasis. Mice deficient in IL-10 or IL-10Rβ develop spontaneous enterocolitis, . Bi-allelic mutations in IL-10 lead to infantile enterocolitis, polymorphisms in IL-10 are associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, and an association has been further reported between IL-10Rα SNPs and early onset UC.<SEP>Dynamic interactions between IL-10 and different IL-10 responsive immune cell lineages participate in IBD pathogenesis. Mice with a deletion of IL-10 or its receptor solely in Foxp3+ T cells can develop spontaneous colitis. The IL-10R-deficient Foxp3+ T cells display decreased IL-10 secretion itself, potentially linking these phenotypes. Further, two recent studies have implicated the IL-10 response by myeloid populations to mucosal homeostasis and colitis susceptibility. Zigmond, et. al. used a CX3CR1 promoter-directed Cre to selectively delete IL-10Rα. These mice developed spontaneous colitis, and implicated IL-10 in the generation of anti-inflammatory CX3CR1+ myeloid cells necessary for colonic homeostasis. Shouval, et. al. demonstrated that IL-10Rβ−/− Rag2−/− mice are susceptible to colitis mediated by total CD4 T cell transfer. The IL-10Rβ deficiency impedes the generation and activity of anti-inflammatory macrophages, and impairs iTreg generation and Treg function. IL-10-producing myeloid cells have also been shown to prevent the downregulation of Foxp3 in T cell transfer colitis, indicating a central role for IL-10 in the crosstalk between regulatory T cell and myeloid populations. Implicating IL-10 in T cell effector function as well, T cell-specific blockade of IL-10 signaling using a dominant negative IL-10 receptor (IL-10RDN) leads to increased Th17 cells in an anti-CD3 Ab induced model of small intestinal inflammation.<SEP>Despite the clear role of IL-10 in intestinal homeostasis, pharmacologic administration of IL-10 has not proven effective. Further resolution of the core interactions, responsible cell types, and pertinent mechanisms underlying IL-10’s activity will be necessary to develop effective interventions targeting this pathway. Here we use the transfer of naive CD4+CD45RBhi T cells into lymphocyte-deficient strains to analyze how the lineage specific activities of IL-10 impact the pathologic T cell response.<SEP>Transferred naïve T cells are activated by microbial flora, provoking Th17-dependent colonic inflammation. Studies using IL-10RDN T cells have indicated that the T cell IL-10 response does not significantly restrain colitis development after CD45RBhi T cell transfer. We verify this here using T cells conditionally deficient in the specific receptor for IL-10, IL-10Rα. However, we further show using additional targeted deletion models that IL-10 acts dominantly on macrophages (Mϕs) to mediate its inhibitory effects, and define how this occurs through a shift in the cytokine dependency of pathologic effector T cells. We show that IL-10 acts on Mϕs to potently suppress IL-1β production through several routes, including the inhibition pro-IL-1β production, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β maturation. This not only modulates colitis, but also transforms the pathologic Th17 response from one that is IL-6-independent and IL-1-dependent to one with an obligate requirement for IL-6. Our findings demonstrate a redundancy in operative Th17 induction pathways during colitis, the critical role of the Mϕ response to IL-10 in controlling these pathways, and imply that coordinated therapies targeting redundant cytokines may be required to fully suppress disease.","Methods<SEP>Mice<SEP>We previously produced and verified correct targeting of IL-10Rαfl/fl mice and lineage specific IL-10Rα deletions on a C57BL/6 background as described in prior publications. These were bred with B6.129S7-Rag1tm1Mom/J mice. B6.129P2-IL-10tm1Cgn/J, B6.129P2-Rorctm1Litt/J, B6.129S7-Il1r1tm1mx/J, B6.129(Cg)-Foxp3tm4(YFP/cre)Ayr/J, and B6;SJL-Il6Rαtm1.1Drew/J mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories. Colonies were maintained under spf, including detectable Helicobacter spp.-free, conditions. Mice of either sex were between 8 and 12 weeks of age at the time of study, and paired between experimental and control groups. Experimental protocols were approved by the St. Jude Animal Care and Use Committee.<SEP>Induction of colitis<SEP>Flow cytometrically sorted CD4+CD25−CD45RBhi T cells (5×105/mouse) derived from pooled splenocytes and LN cells of indicated mice were transferred i.v. into Rag1−/− or IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice. Body weight was monitored on a weekly basis. For neutrophil depletion studies, 1 mg anti-Ly6G mAb 1A8 (Bio-X-Cell) or control IgG was administered per mouse i.p. 1 d before cell transfer and weekly thereafter. Depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry. For analyses of Treg-mediated disease suppression, splenocytes from Foxp3-YFP reporter mice were collected and naïve T cells, defined as CD4+CD45RBhiYFP−, and Treg cells, defined as CD4+CD45RBlowYFP+, sorted. Purity after sorting was >99%. Age-matched Rag1−/− mice or IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice received 2×105 naive T cells with or without Treg cells at a 1:1 ratio i.v.<SEP>Histology<SEP>Colons were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Three independent sections were assessed per mouse by a blinded reviewer. Inflammation scoring: 0, no or occasional inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (LP); 1, increased LP inflammatory cells; 2, confluence of inflammatory cells extending into the submucosa; 3, transmural infiltrate extension of the infiltrate. Ulceration scoring: 0, no ulceration; 1, mild (1–2 ulcers per 40 crypts analyzed); 2, moderate (3–4 ulcers); 3, severe (> 4 ulcers). Hyperplasia scoring: 0, normal; 1, crypts up to twice normal thickness with normal epithelium; 2, crypts >2 times normal thickness, hyperchromatic epithelium; reduced goblet cells, scattered arborization; 3, Crypts >4 times normal thickness, marked hyperchromasia, few to no goblet cells, high mitotic index, frequent arborization. Disease area scoring: 0, 0–5% involvement; 1, 5–30%; 2, 30–70%; 3, >70%. Total score is the sum of individual scores.<SEP>Cytokine levels<SEP>Frozen colon samples were homogenized in ice-cold PBS containing 1% NP-40 and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cytokines and chemokines were measured by Luminex (Bio-Rad) or ELISA (R&D Systems).<SEP>LP cell isolation<SEP>LP cells were isolated using a modification of a previously described protocol. Large intestines were carefully excised, mesentery and fat removed, and intestines then opened longitudinally, rinsed in HBSS and cut into 1-cm pieces. Colon segments were vigorously shaken twice in medium with 1 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at 37°C, and suspended cells collected and filtered through a cell strainer. Tissue was further minced and incubated at 37°C for 1 h in medium with 1 mM collagenase type IV (Sigma-Aldrich) and 40 U ml−1 DNase I (Roche) with agitation.

After 16–20 h, lymphocytes were isolated, stained with Abs to cell surface markers, fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm Buffer (BD Biosciences), treated with DNase (300 μg ml−1) at 37°C for 1 h, stained with anti–BrdU-APC (BD BRDU flow kit), and analyzed by flow cytometry.<SEP>BMDM culture and LPS stimulation<SEP>BMDMs were generated by culturing mouse bone marrow cells in L-cell-conditioned IMDM. The L-cell conditioned medium comprised supernant from cultures of L929 cells secreting M-CSF mixed at a 1:2 ratio with IMDM and then supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. After 6 days of culture, cells were seeded in 12-well plates, and the next day treated with IL-10 (50ng ml−1) or anti-IL-10Rα Ab (1μg ml−1), and 4 h later stimulated with or without LPS (20 ng ml−1) for 12 h. For the final 30 min, 5mM ATP was added into the medium.<SEP>Western blot<SEP>Culture samples were denatured in loading buffer containing SDS and 100 mM DTT, and boiled for 5 min.

These (5×105) were co-cultured at a ratio of 5:1 with or without sorted LPMϕs from 8 week diseased IL-10RαMdel Rag1−/− or Rag1−/− mice in 96-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg ml−1 anti-CD3 and 2 μg ml−1 anti-CD28. Cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 media containing 5 ng ml−1 TGF-β, 10 μg ml−1 anti-IL-4 and 10 μg ml−1 anti-IFN-γ Abs. 20 ng ml−1 IL-6 was added to a positive control Th17 culture condition only. After 4 days, cells were washed and restimulated with cytokine stimulation cocktail containing PMA, Ionomycin and Brefeldin A (Cell stimulation cocktail, eBioscience) for 4 hours at 37°C. Cells were washed and stained for the indicated cytokines.<SEP>Immunohistochemistry<SEP>Tissue cryosections were fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C overnight, embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, and sectioned in a cryostat (12 μm). For IL-1β immunostaining, sections were incubated with a polyclonal goat anti-mouse IL-1β primary antibody (1:200, R&D Systems) and monoclonal rat anti-mouse CD11b antibody (1:500, AbD Serotec). After washing 3 times with TBST, sections were incubated with Cy3-labeled donkey-anti-rat IgG antibody (1:200, Jackson Lab) and Alexa 488-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (1:200,Molecular Probes). Sections were mounted with mounting medium containing DAPI (Invitrogen), and confocal microscopy was performed.<SEP>Statistics<SEP>Statistics were calculated using Prism5 (GraphPad Software). Group comparisons were by two-sided Student’s t-test or, when multiple cohorts were present, ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. A p< 0.05 was considered significant.","Results<SEP>T cell IL-10 response does not impact colitis development<SEP>To evaluate lineage-specific effects of IL-10 in T cell transfer-mediated colitis, we first produced mice with a selective deletion of the specific IL-10 receptor, IL-10Rα, restricted to T cells (IL-10RαTdel). Colitis was then induced by transferring naive CD4+CD25−CD45RBhi T cells from wild-type (WT) or IL-10RαTdel mice into Rag1−/− recipients. Disease magnitude and quality were monitored through changes in body weight, colon histopathology, and colonic T cell and T cell subset (Th1, Th17, Foxp3+) infiltration (Supplementary Fig. 1). No differences were identified between recipients of WT and IL-10RαTdel T cells, indicating that IL-10 signaling into the transferred T cells does not modulate colitis severity in this T cell-dependent model.<SEP>Mϕ response to IL-10 restrains T cell-mediated colitis<SEP>We previously demonstrated that macrophage but not DC or T cell IL-10 signaling prominently alleviated inflammation in a distinct T cell-independent, toxin-induced model of acute colitis, DSS colitis. Recent data have also implicated myeloid cells as regulators of disease severity in T cell transfer colitis. To assess the impact of DC and Mϕ-selective deletion of IL-10Rα (IL-10RαDCdel, IL-10RαMdel) in T cell transfer colitis, we generated lineage-specific knock-outs on a Rag1−/− background and induced disease. Histologic and clinical disease did not differ between Rag1−/− and IL-10RαDCdelRag1−/− recipients (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). In contrast, disease was intensified in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Weight loss was elevated and accelerated, with a mean±s.e.m. decrement at 8 wk of 19.1±1.1% vs 9.3±1.1% for Rag1−/− controls (Fig. 1a). IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− colons were shorter than Rag1−/− controls (8.2±0.3 vs 7.1±0.2 cm, Fig. 1b). Histopathology in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− colons demonstrated increased inflammation, with more extensive cellular infiltrates, submucosal edema, and epithelial erosion (Fig. 1c). Total histologic score was 8.3±0.6 and 3.6±0.7 (scale 0–12) for IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− mice respectively. Moreover, fewer IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice survived with extended disease times (Fig. 1d), and these developed an elevated incidence of rectal prolapse (75% IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice vs 0% Rag1−/− controls at 12 wk).<SEP>In a recent study, mice deleting IL-10R using a CX3CR1-driven Cre that is expressed by a large proportion of LPMϕs developed spontaneous colitis. We did not observe overt spontaneous disease in our IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice during the time frame of our assays. To further assess this, cohorts of these and IL-10Rαfl/flRag1−/− controls (n=10 for each) were aged for 6 months. There was no difference in weight gain, or presence of clinical signs of colitis or other illness in either population (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Histologic analysis of 5 aged IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice failed to identify evidence for colitis. Similarly, spontaneous colitis was not observed in 6 month aged IL-10RαMdelRag1+/+ mice.<SEP>IL-10’s protective role in colitis is well established. To determine whether the Mϕ-specific response to IL-10 can account for this, we also compared disease in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice with Rag1−/− mice harboring a germline deletion in IL-10Rα (IL-10Rα−/−Rag1−/−; Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). No difference in clinical disease or histopathology was evident in these two recipient lines, implying that IL-10-mediated immunoprotection can largely be accounted for by its Mϕ-specific effects.<SEP>The Lys-M-Cre transgene used to ablate IL-10Rα in the IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice is expressed in granulocytes as well as Mϕs. Neutrophils have a modest protective role in T cell transfer colitis, and loss of IL-10Rα signaling there, rather than in Mϕs, may have impacted disease. To isolate the Mϕ-specific effect, we depleted neutrophils with specific Ab beginning prior to T cell transfer. Neutrophils were undetectable in the peripheral blood from αLy6G Ab but not control Ab treated animals throughout the experimental interval. In Rag1−/− recipients, weight loss was mildly increased on some disease days in neutrophil-depleted mice, though no significant difference in histopathology was identified (Fig. 1e, f). No significant change in disease severity was apparent with neutrophil depletion in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice. Further, the prominent disease exacerbation in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− compared with Rag1−/− recipients persisted after neutrophil depletion, indicating that the intensified immunopathology in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice is primarily attributable to the Mϕ rather than granulocyte IL-10 response.<SEP>Increased numbers and activation of IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− LPMϕs<SEP>To identify causes of the enhanced IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− disease, we first analyzed lamina propria macrophages (LPMϕs). LPMϕs, typed as CD11bhiCD11c−/lo/modF4/80+Ly6G−/loSiglecF−, were significantly increased in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice with colitis compared with Rag1−/− controls (Fig. 2a). This population was uniformly CD64+ and predominantly CX3CR1+, further delineating them as LPMϕs (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The cells were further characterized by a uniformly elevated surface expression of activation markers, including CD40, CD80, and CD86 (Fig. 2b). Segregation of CD11b+CD64+CD103− and CD45+ cells based on Ly6C and class II MHC expression can distinguish pro-inflammatory (Ly6Chi) and anti-inflammatory (Ly6Clo) macrophage populations. Most LPMϕs analyzed using this alternative gating strategy were phenotypically pro-inflammatory, and the proportions of Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo macrophages did not differ between IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice and Rag1−/− controls (Supplementary Fig. 3b).<SEP>The increased IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− versus Rag1−/− LPMϕ numbers were further associated with an increased proliferation rate, as determined by incorporation of the nucleotide analog BrdU. Unlike for LPMϕs, no differences in BrdU incorporation were evident in colonic CD4 T cells, DCs, and neutrophils, or in Mϕs from other locations (Fig. 2c). Therefore, numbers, proliferation, and activation state of LPMϕs are increased in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice.<SEP>Unimpaired IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− T regulatory response<SEP>A subset of T cells transferred into Rag1−/− mice upregulate Foxp3, and IL-10 signaling into Mϕs could contribute to the generation and maintenance of these regulatory T cells. Indeed, recent findings with IL-10Rβ−/−Rag2−/− mice have identified defective iTreg formation and Treg function. Treg co-transferred with naïve T cells even at a 1:1 ratio were incapable of preventing disease. To assess Treg activity here, we quantified Foxp3+ iTreg forming in the LP, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and spleen of IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and control Rag1−/− colitic mice. No differences were observed (Fig. 3a). We next analyzed whether sorted Treg transferred into IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− mice with the induction of colitis could prevent disease. The transferred cells were able to fully suppress disease development in both IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− recipients, indicating that a macrophage-specific defect in IL-10 response does not overtly impact Treg suppressive activity in this setting (Fig. 3b). Treg transfers led to a >2-fold increase in Treg in the spleens, MLNs, and colons of recipient mice and Treg percentages did not differ between IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− recipients in any of the locations (Fig. 3c). These results indicate that Treg are able to suppress disease in the absence of a macrophage-specific response to IL-10, and that Treg-specific mechanisms independent of IL-10 actions on macrophages are employed in this system.<SEP>Alternative regulatory T cell populations are demarcated by IL-10 production, and IL-10 itself may impact these directly or indirectly. To evaluate this, we induced colitis by transferring naïve T cells from IL-10-GFP knock-in reporter mice. Here too, no differences in population sizes were seen (Fig. 3d). To determine if T cell IL-10 production was itself functionally dispensable for the differential colitis in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice, we performed transfers using IL-10−/− or WT T cells. Disease severity, measured clinically and histologically, was exclusively associated with recipient type. IL-10 production by transferred T cells did not influence disease magnitude clinically or histologically (Fig. 3e, f). Therefore, the Mϕ IL-10 response does not identifiably impact regulatory T cell presence. Further, while Mϕ response to IL-10 is critical in attenuating disease, T cells are not a significant source of this IL-10 here.<SEP>Pro-inflammatory cytokine production by IL-10RαMdel LPMϕs<SEP>To further evaluate the heightened disease severity in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice, we measured in whole colons the levels of cytokines implicated in its pathogenesis, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-γ. With early disease (wk 4), IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1 were increased in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− colon compared with Rag1−/− controls (Fig. 4a). As disease progressed (wk 8), the quantity of cytokine produced was altered. Additional elevations in IL-17 and TNF-α were identified at this time. Differences in IL-10 and IFN-γ were not seen.<SEP>T cell transfer colitis is associated with colonic infiltration by both Th1 and Th17 cells, and the Th17 response is required for disease development. Our identification of increased colonic IL-6 and IL-1β in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice, cytokines associated with Th17 induction, coupled with elevated IL-17 but not IFN-γ levels implied an intensification of the Th17 response. To test this, we enumerated IFN-γ and IL-17 producing T cells in the colonic infiltrate. Significantly increased percents and absolute numbers of CD4+IL-17A+ T cells were identified in IL-10RαMdel Rag1−/− compared with Rag1−/− colons (Fig. 4b). Likewise, after the induction of disease with CD4+CD25−CD45RBhi RORγT-GFP reporter T cells, increased GFP+ T cells were identified in the colon at 4 and 8 wk (Supplementary Fig. 4a). No differences in CD4+IFN-γ+ T cell quantities were evident (Fig. 4c).<SEP>To more specifically determine whether elevated production of Th17-promoting cytokines was specific to the Mϕ population, we sorted colonic CD11bhiCD11c−/lo/modF4/80+Ly6G−/loSiglecF− LPMϕs from colitic mice and assayed their cytokine expression profiles by qRT-PCR. A particularly prominent elevation in IL-1β production was apparent in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− compared with Rag1−/− LPMϕs (mRNA expression ratio: 7.5±1.2). Lesser elevations in IL-6 (3.4±0.5), IL-23 (2.9±0.3) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines were also identified (Fig. 4d, e). IL-10 itself was unchanged and a modest decline in arginase with a corresponding increase in iNOS further indicated enhanced pro-inflammatory function of the IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− LPMϕs. For IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23p19, and iNOS, relative expression was compared in sorted colonic LPMϕs, DCs, neutrophils, and epithelial cells (Fig. 4d). Elevated expression was specific to the Mϕs, indicating that Mϕs are the primary source for the increased Th17-associated cytokines and implying that IL-10 acts directly on these cells to suppress their production.<SEP>As an alternative gating strategy, we also sorted CD11b+CD64+CD103−CD45+Ly6Chi LPMϕs and assessed similarly for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23, IL-10, iNOS, and arginase. These were differentially expressed in a manner paralleling results above (Supplementary Fig. 4b). CD163 was additionally assessed as a marker for anti-inflammatory macrophages and found to be similar in the IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and control Rag1−/− populations.<SEP>Colitis in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice is Th17 dependent<SEP>Th17 cells have been shown to be essential to T cell transfer colitis in Rag1−/− mice. The elevated colonic inflammation in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice was correlated with an increased Th17 response, but may also have been mediated by alternative pathologic pathways. To verify a role for Th17 cells, we transferred RORγT−/− T cells into Rag1−/− and IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients (Supplementary Fig. 5). RORγT, and hence Th17 cells, proved essential for colitis in both recipient types.<SEP>Colitis is IL-6 independent in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice<SEP>Though IL-6 is well established as a key inducer of Th17 cells, its isolated role in fostering the Th17 response fundamental to T cell transfer colitis has not been addressed. The increased IL-6 in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice might have driven the increased immunopathology there. To assess this, we induced colitis by transfers of IL-6Rα−/− or WT naive T cells into IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− recipients. IL-6Rα−/− T cells were ineffective in inducing disease in Rag1−/− mice (Fig. 5a, b). Mice gained weight after T cell transfer and histologic lesions were mild. In contrast, IL-6Rα−/− and WT T cells proved equipotent in mediating severe clinical disease in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients. Although there was a trend toward modestly diminished histologic severity after IL-6Rα−/− transfer, this was not significant. Thus, the Mϕ response to IL-10 creates a dependency for IL-6 in disease pathogenesis.<SEP>To better understand this, we analyzed the T cell responses leading to colonic injury. Th17 cell percentages among CD4+TCR+ T cells were reduced in the MLNs of mice receiving IL-6Rα−/− T cells (Fig. 5c). This was true for both IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− mice. Thus IL-6Rα signaling supports but is not essential for Th17 formation in the MLNs of both of these recipient lines. In the colon, the representation of Th17 cells was significantly decreased in Rag1−/− but not IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients. This indicates a relative expansion of Th17 cells at the site of autoimmune inflammation specifically in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice.<SEP>Absolute numbers of Th17 cells in all organs sampled dramatically differed between Rag1−/− and IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients of IL-6Rα−/− T cells. Few Th17 cells were present in the spleens, MLNs, and colons of Rag1−/− recipients, whereas large numbers were present in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients (Fig. 5c). This difference reflected a pervasive decrease in total T cell number with the IL-6Rα−/−→Rag1−/− transfers (Fig. 5d). Therefore, IL-6 is broadly necessary for T cell expansion and colitis in Rag1−/− but dispensable in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice. IL-10’s actions on Mϕs generate an IL-6 requirement for autoinflammatory disease and robust T cell expansion.<SEP>In contrast to Th17 development, no differences were identified in the proportions of Th1 or Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells in any of the transfer combinations tested, indicating that T cell IL-6 and Mϕ IL-10 responses do not similarly skew these maturation pathways (Fig. 5e, f). However, absolute numbers of Th1 and Foxp3+ cells were diminished in the IL-6Rα−/− →Rag1−/− combination, again reflecting the impaired T cell expansion in the absence of disease development.<SEP>IL-1 response is required for IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− colitis<SEP>IL-1β plays an essential role in the steady-state development of intestinal Th17 cells in healthy mice and further promotes the Th17 response during colitis. Considering this, the lack of a requirement for IL-6 in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice (Fig. 5a, b), and the dramatically elevated IL-1β expression in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− LPMϕs (Fig. 4), we hypothesized that IL-1β plays a pathologic role in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice that is able to supersede the IL-6 requirement for colitis. To test IL-1’s impact, we induced colitis by transferring IL-1R−/− T cells into IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− recipients.<SEP>IL-1R−/− T cell transfers into Rag1−/− mice did not lead to the virtually complete disease protection seen after IL-6Rα−/− T cell transfers. However IL-1R−/− →Rag1−/− transfers did show diminished clinical and histologic measures of colitis compared with control WT T cell transfers (Fig. 6a, b). IL-1R−/− T cells also provoked significantly milder disease than WT T cells In IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients (Fig. 6a, b). This contrasts with IL-6Rα−/− T cells, which did not detectably alter disease severity. Therefore, while T cell IL-6 responsiveness is clinically important only in Rag1−/− colitis, T cell IL-1 response modulates both Rag1−/− and IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− disease.<SEP>We performed similar analyses of the impact on T cell responses after IL-1R−/− transfers as for the IL-6Rα−/− transfers above. Whereas a decreased percent and absolute number of Th17 cells was seen in the MLNs, a site of T cell priming, after IL-6Rα−/− transfers (Fig. 5c), no differences in the MLNs were seen for IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− or Rag1−/− recipients receiving IL-1R−/− compared with WT T cells (Fig. 6c). However, substantially diminished proportions and absolute numbers of Th17 cells were seen in the colons of mice receiving IL-1R−/− T cells. The actions of IL-1 were specific to Th17 effectors; no differences were identified in Th1 and Foxp3+ Treg populations (Fig. 6d, e). This indicates that there is a selective defect in the Th17 response in the colon. T cell IL-1 but not IL-6 response in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice promotes colonic inflammation by supporting Th17 cells at the site of autoinflammatory disease. In Rag1−/− mice, where IL-10 suppresses LPMϕ IL-1β production, IL-6 plays a more critical role.<SEP>Il-10 inhibits pro-IL-1β production and maturation<SEP>Our data indicated that IL-1β, increased in the colon of IL-10RαMdel mice, supports the pathologic Th17 response mediating colitis. IL-10 inhibits this IL-1β production thereby attenuating disease. To determine whether IL-1β protein in the colon is primarily produced by LPMϕs, we used immunohistochemistry to colocalize IL-1β and CD11b in colon sections from diseased IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 6a). This demonstrated that IL-1β is largely associated with the CD11b+ population.<SEP>IL-1β is generated from an inactive cytosolic precursor (pro-IL-1β). Caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β, converting it into its active form which is then released from the cell. Caspase-1, in turn, is activated by inflammasome stimulation. To better evaluate the impact of IL-10 signaling on IL-1β production by LPMϕs, we first quantified pro-IL-1β levels by flow cytometry in gated CD11bhiCD11c−/lo/modF4/80+Ly6G−/loSiglecF− Mϕs. This demonstrated a 1.7-fold elevation in the percent of LPMϕs expressing pro-IL-1β in the colons of diseased IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− compared with Rag1−/− mice (mean±s.d.: 84.6±6.0% vs 48.6±8.4%; Fig. 7a). Further, the MFI of positive cells from IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice was nearly 2-fold greater than that from control mice (131.4±9.3 vs 76.6±5.7). In contrast to the colons of diseased mice, pro-IL-1β levels were low to undetectable in MLN and bone marrow macrophages, and levels did not differ between IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice and Rag1−/− controls. Differences in pro-IL-1β were also not apparent in mice in which disease was not induced (Supplementary Fig. 6b).<SEP>We verified that pro-IL-1β was directly regulated in Mϕ by IL-10, analyzing its production in cultured and LPS and ATP-stimulated Mϕ by Western analysis, and simultaneously assessing for mature IL-1β formation (Fig. 7b and Supplemenatary Fig. 7). Substantially lower amounts of both pro-IL-1β and IL-1β were present in cultures of Rag1−/− than IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− Mϕ. After treatment with IL-10, pro-IL-β was diminished and mature IL-1β undetectable in Rag1−/− cultures, while this manipulation had no effect on IL-10RαMdelRag1−/−-derived Mϕs. In contrast, treatment with blocking anti-IL-10R antibody elevated Rag1−/− pro-IL-1β and IL-1β levels to those seen with IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− Mϕs.<SEP>The complete suppression of IL-1β maturation by IL-10 suggested that Mϕ IL-10R signaling also suppressed caspase-1-activation. To test this we assessed for caspase-1 cleavage to its activated form. LPS and ATP stimulation of Rag1−/− Mϕs led to a modest increase in activated caspase-1 (p20, Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Pre-treatment of Rag1−/− Mϕs with IL-10, however, abrogated this induction. In contrast, pre-treatment with anti-IL-10Rα Ab markedly increased activated caspase-1, indicating that autocrine IL-10 normally restrains caspase-1 activation. In the IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− Mϕs, p20 formation was similarly increased regardless of IL-10 or anti-IL-10Rα Ab treatment.<SEP>To determine whether increased IL-1 and IL-6 from LPMϕs can also directly impact Th17 cell maturation, we sorted LPMϕs from diseased IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and control Rag1−/− mice, and co-cultured them with naïve T cells in the presence of added TGFβ but not IL-6. Some Th17 formed in the presence of Rag1−/− LPMϕs, however, this was markedly elevated with IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− LPMϕs (Fig. 7c). Addition of αIL-6Rα blocking antibody largely abrogated Th17 formation with Rag1−/− LPMϕs. However, consistent with our in vivo findings after IL-6R−/− T cell transfer, this effect was modest with IL-10RαMdelRag1−/−-derived LPMϕs. Blocking IL-1 signaling led to more substantial inhibition of Th17 development in IL-10RαMdel Rag1−/−-derived LPMϕs and inhibition of signaling by both cytokines essentially abrogated Th17 formation. Therefore, IL-10 can act on LPMϕs to directly impair their support of Th17 production. This occurs through the downregulation of IL-1 and to a lesser extent IL-6.","Discussion<SEP>IL-10’s anti-inflammatory signals maintain intestinal homeostasis. Yet the essential targets and mechanisms of IL-10 action are incompletely understood. Recent data has provided support for a myeloid response to IL-10 in restraining colonic inflammation, and indicated a critical role for IL-10 in the production of anti-inflammatory LPMϕs that are essential for maintaining immune homeostasis. We demonstrate here that Mϕs are the primary targets of IL-10 limiting colitis after naive T cell transfer into immunodeficient mice. We further identify how the macrophage-specific response to IL-10 skews the production and expansion of pathologic T cells, thereby promoting disease exacerbation. Colitis is Th17 dependent regardless of Mϕ IL-10 response. However, we show that IL-10 converts the disease from one that is independent of the Th17 inducing cytokine IL-6 to one that is highly dependent. In Rag1−/− recipients of CD4+CD45RBhi T cells, T cell responsiveness to IL-6 is necessary for Th17 formation and colitis development. However, in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients of IL-6Rα−/− T cells, a strong Th17 amplification occurs. Colitis develops that is clinically indistinguishable from that in recipients of IL-6RαWT T cells.<SEP>Our results further indicate that the Mϕ response to IL-10 downmodulates multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colon, but its impact on IL-1β, recently documented to regulate Th17 formation during colitis, appears paramount. IL-10 therefore shifts the cytokine requirements for the Th17 response. In IL-10’s absence, redundancy between IL-1β and IL-6 supports persistent colitis. Implicitly, though monotherapy with anti-IL-6 may be promising, tandem inhibition of the IL-1 pathway may be necessary for optimal suppression of the Th17 response in IBD, particularly where IL-10 signaling is attenuated.<SEP>Previous studies have indicated a role for IL-1β in promoting Th17 development both in humans and mice, . IL-1β levels in IL-10−/− mice with colitis are elevated and we extend this finding here to show that a Mϕ-selective deficit in IL-10 response is sufficient for this. Prior in vitro findings have also indicated that IL-1β synergizes with IL-23 to promote Th17 expansion, and we did observe increased IL-23 along with IL-1β production by IL-10Rα-deficient macrophages.<SEP>Though we and others have identified an essential role for RORγT+ Th17 cells in colitis and elevated Th17 cells and/or cytokines have been observed in patients with IBD, the actual role of IL-17 itself is controversial and in a randomized control trial anti-IL-17A proved ineffective in Crohn’s disease. Identifying effector mechanisms responsible for Th17 mediated immunopathology during colitis will be important as new therapeutic strategies are developed.<SEP>Zigmond, et. al., recently found that mice with a CX3CR1-restricted IL-10Rα deficiency develop spontaneous colitis. This was hypothesized to be mediated by defective macrophage regulation by IL-10. Our findings are consistent with this and with a unique defining role for macrophages in colitis susceptibility. CX3CR1 is also expressed by DCs and monocytes, and by using IL-10RαDCdelRag1−/−, IL-10RαMdelRag1−/−, IL-10Rα−/−Rag1−/− and neutrophil specific depleted mice, our findings support a dominant role for IL-10 action on macrophages in colitis development. This identification of Mϕ as a key target of IL-10 is consistent with a recently published report showing that ATP derived from commensal bacteria promotes Th17 differentiation through a subset of CD11c−/low LP cells. Unlike Zigmond, et. al., we did not observe spontaneous autoimmunity in our animals, Differences in microflora, and particularly the presence of Helicobacter spp., may account for this. Our colony is maintained under helicobacter-free conditions, whereas Zigmond, et. al. report the presence of helicobacter. Consistently, helicobacter-free IL-10 deficient mice are protected from spontaneous disease. Alternatively, differences in the subsets of Mϕs expressing the CX3CR1 versus Lys-M promoters, may distinguish spontaneous disease susceptibility in our two systems, and this needs to be further explored.<SEP>Shouval, et. al. recently identified a prominent role for IL-10Rβ signaling into myeloid cells in suppressing colitis development. A significant diminution of the Foxp3+ regulatory T cell response was seen. We did not identify a discernible effect of Mϕ IL-10Rα deficiency on iTreg development or transferred nTreg function. This will need resolution. IL-10Rβ is also utilized by IL-22, IL-26 and IFN-λ, which might explain the differences. Alternatively, cell types besides Lys-M+ macrophages may provide critical signals supporting Treg formation and maintenance, and IL-10 may be necessary for this. Regardless of these differences, Shouval, et. al. demonstrated a strongly pro-inflammatory phenotype of IL-10Rβ−/− BMDM, and extended this to Mϕs from IL-10R deficient patients, implying that these regulatory mechanics are translatable to human IBD. Cumulatively, these data provide strong evidence for macrophage as the critical target of IL-10, and assert several mechanisms through which this occurs.<SEP>After transfers of IL-6Rα-deficient T cells, we identified a decreased percent of Th17 cells in the MLN but not colon of IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients. This may imply that Th17 cells primed in the MLN are amplified by IL-1β in the colon. However, the site(s) of priming of the Th17 response in colitis is not defined and it is possible that additional priming occurs within gut-associated lymphoid tissue itself. In this regards, we show that isolated LPMϕs from IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice have an enhanced ability to support Th17 development from naïve T cells. Hence, although without being able to track the initial site of pathologic T cell development we cannot distinguish whether IL-1β in our system is acting at priming or expansion of Th17 cells, increased colonic Mϕ IL-1β production can support either or both of these mechanisms.<SEP>Our results here are consistent with data demonstrating that IL-10 acts via STAT3 to suppress pro-IL-1β production. Moreover, we extend these findings, showing that IL-10 further inhibits caspase-1 activity. Caspase-1 is activated through inflammasome induced oligomerization and autocatalytic cleavage and it will be important to identify the precise site at which IL-10 acts within the inflammasome cascade.<SEP>Though our study specifically interrogates the IL-10 response during colitis, its implications may extend beyond this. IL-1β also promotes the Th17 response in Helicobacter hepaticus colitis. Administration of rIL-1-β selectively induced Th17 cells in the steady-state intestinal environment. High levels of IL-1β are associated with an amplified Th17 response in autoimmune RA and EAE models. These effects of IL-1β on Th17 cells may be similarly IL-10 and Mϕ dependent, and this can be assessed using the conditional knock-out mice we have developed.<SEP>Our results, as those using a Tg DN IL-10R, do not support transferred naïve T cells as a significant target of IL-10 in this model. This does not indicate that IL-10 is not a significant T cell regulator. The effects of IL-10 on T cells is complex, and system and T cell subset dependent. Thus, the Treg response to IL-10 was found to sustain Treg in colitis, and mice with a Treg-selective deletion of IL-10R developed spontaneous colitis, . Likewise, we have identified direct effects of IL-10 on T cells in regulating myelin-specific responses during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.<SEP>It will also be important to identify the source of IL-10 relevant to Mϕ targets. Our findings here and those of others indicate that neither effector nor the adaptive regulatory T cells that form after naïve T cell transfer are relevant sources. In contrast, purified and adoptively transferred IL-10−/− Tregs were seen to be less potent than WT Tregs in preventing and treating established colitis, indicating that Treg IL-10 is significant in some circumstances. However, Treg only account for a portion of IL-10’s effects. The absence of a physiologically relevant T cell IL-10 source here may suggest a myeloid source. Mϕ themselves are strong IL-10 producers and autocrine IL-10 signaling may well provide necessary signals that prevent overzealous Mϕ reactions. Indeed, we identified substantial IL-10 mediated autoregulation of pro-IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation in cultured Mϕ (Fig. 7). In contrast, Zigmond et. al. found no role for CX3CR1+ macrophage-produced IL-10 in the spontaneous colitis that they observed, potentially implying that multiple sources may be relevant.<SEP>In summary, we show that the Mϕ response to IL-10 is critical for Th17 development during colitis. Further, IL-10’s suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production does not obviate the essential role for Th17 cells but does shift the cytokine requirements for that response from one primarily governed through IL-1β to one that is IL-6 dependent.",43010,"['OBWCCE', 'FOODAL']"
33462485,"Introduction<SEP>The gut microbiome is an integral part of the human holobiont. In recent years, many studies have highlighted the link between its perturbations and immune, metabolic, neurologic and psychiatric traits, drug metabolism and cancer. Environmental factors, like diet and medication, play a significant role in shaping the gut microbiome composition, although twin, family and population-based studies have shown that the genetic component also plays a role in determining gut microbiota composition, and a proportion of bacterial taxa are heritable.<SEP>Several studies have investigated the effect of genetics on microbiome composition through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and identified dozens of associated loci. However, little cross-replication across these studies has been observed so far. This may be due to a number of factors. First, methodological differences in the collection, processing and annotation of stool microbiota are known to have significant effects on the microbiome profiles obtained and can generate heterogeneity and a lack of reproducibility across studies. Second, most association signals are rather weak, which suggests that existing studies of 1,000–2,000 samples are underpowered. Finally, some of the GWAS signals related to microbiome compositions may be population-specific, i.e. they may represent bona fide population differences in genetic structure and/or environment.<SEP>To address these challenges and obtain valuable insights into the relationship between host genetics and microbiota composition, we set up the international consortium MiBioGen. In this study, we have coordinated 16S rRNA gene sequencing profiles and genotyping data from 18,340 participants from 24 cohorts from the USA, Canada, Israel, South Korea, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and the UK. We performed a large-scale, multi-ethnic, genome-wide meta-analysis of the associations between autosomal human genetic variants and the gut microbiome. We explored the variation of microbiome composition across different populations and investigated the effects of differences in methodology on the microbiome data. Through the implementation of a standardized pipeline, we then performed microbiome trait loci (mbTL) mapping to identify genetic loci that affect the relative abundance (mbQTLs) or presence (microbiome Binary Trait loci, or mbBTLs) of microbial taxa. Finally, we focused on the biological interpretation of GWAS findings through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) and Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches.","Online Methods<SEP>Data collection<SEP>A total of 25 cohorts, comprising18,340 participants of different ethnicities and ages, participated in the microbiome GWAS analysis (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). The Supplementary Note provides detailed descriptions of data collection per cohort.<SEP>16S microbiome data processing<SEP>The rationale behind the selection of the 16S rRNA processing pipeline was described previously. In short, the divergence in the 16S rRNA gene domains between cohorts makes operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-level analysis impossible, while the use of a direct taxonomic classification of the reads and an up-to-date reference database allowed us to achieve good between-domain concordance of taxonomic composition and a higher mapping rate.<SEP>The participating cohorts varied in their sample collection protocol, selection of DNA purification kits used to extract DNA from fecal samples, the 16S domain selected for PCR (Supplementary Table 1), read length, depth, post-sequencing quality control (QC) and the software used to merge tags of paired-end sequencing. After processing the QC-filtered merged reads, all cohorts implemented the standardized 16S processing pipeline (https://github.com/alexa-kur/miQTL_cookbook) that uses SILVA release 128 as a reference database, with truncating the taxonomic resolution of the database to genus level.<SEP>Briefly, the procedure was as follows. First, all samples were rarefied to 10,000 reads using a predefined random seed to allow for rarefaction reproducibility. Samples with fewer than 10,000 reads were discarded. Second, RDP classifier v.2.12 was used to bin the reads to a reference database. For each taxonomic level, the posterior probability of 0.8 was used as a cutoff to bin each read to the corresponding taxon. The posterior cutoff probability was traced for each taxonomic level separately. For example, if the posterior probability passed the cutoff on family level but not on genus level, the read was binned to taxonomy on the family level (all corresponding upper taxonomic levels) and discarded on the genus level. It was also assigned to a special “NOTAX_genus” pseudo-taxon to maintain data compositionality.<SEP>To characterize the contribution of cohort-wise metadata (16S domain, DNA extraction method, cohort ethnicity, lysis temperature and type of lysis buffer) to the microbiome composition, we used a distance-based redundancy analysis test in which each cohort represented a sample and variables represented mean abundances of genera in the corresponding cohort (taxa with prevalence below 20% discarded). The association of metadata with richness was performed by multivariate linear regression analysis.<SEP>The alpha diversity indices, including Shannon, Simpson and inverse Simpson indices, were calculated on genus level with non-adjusted, non-transformed taxa counts. For all other analyses, the taxonomic counts of non-zero samples were natural log–transformed and adjusted for potential covariate effects using linear regression. The list of covariates used in the regression models varied between cohorts, but always included sex, age, genetic principal components (PCs) calculated on non-imputed genetic data (3 PCs for monoethnic cohorts, 10 PCs for multiethnic cohorts and 5 PCs for the HCHS/SOL cohort as a multi-ethnic population of different, but closely related ethnicities; see Supplementary Note for Cohort descriptions) and cohort-specific potential microbiome batch effects, if applicable. Variables such as the length of time in non-frozen storage, the 16S sequencing batch, etc. were also included. The residuals of the adjustment were then scaled and centered (mean=0 and SD=1).<SEP>In the analysis of microbiome composition heterogeneity, the cohorts SHIP/SHIP-TREND and GEM_HCE_v12/GEM_HCE_v24/GEM_HCE_ICHIP were merged to SHIP and GEM, respectively, because they were analyzed with exactly the same protocols in the same laboratories. In the microbiome–genetics analysis, these five cohorts were included individually as they differed in the genotyping arrays and/or general populations they represented.<SEP>For each cohort, only the taxa present in more than 10% of the samples were included in the quantitative microbiome trait loci (mbQTL) mapping, whereas taxa present in more than 10% but less than 90% of the samples were included in binary trait loci (mbBTL) mapping (Supplementary Table 3). Study-wide cutoffs for mbQTL mapping included an effective sample size of at least 3,000 samples and presence in at least three cohorts. For mbBTLs, a mean abundance higher than 1% in the taxon-positive samples was required. This resulted in 211 taxa (131 genera, 35 families, 20 orders, 16 classes and 9 phyla) that passed taxon inclusion cutoffs for mbQTL analysis, and 177 taxa (108 genera, 34 families, 16 orders, 12 classes and 7 phyla) for mbBTL analysis.<SEP>Genetic data processing<SEP>Despite the difference in genotyping array platforms, most cohorts used similar procedures for imputation and post-imputation filtering steps. Twenty-three out of 24 cohorts used the Michigan Imputation Server (https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/index.html) for imputation, using the HRC 1.0 or 1.1 reference panel. Due to restrictions in manipulating data, the PNP study employed an in-house pipeline for imputation instead, using IMPUTE2 software (v.2.3.2) and 1000G reference panel with addition of population-matched genotypes of Jewish individuals. The post-imputation cutoffs were the same for PNP and the other cohorts.<SEP>Post-imputation VCFs were transformed into TriTyper format and filtered using GenotypeHarmonizer v.1.4.20 software. The following cutoffs were applied for inclusion: minor allele frequency >0.05, pointwise imputation QC >0.4 and SNP-wise call rate filtering >0.95.<SEP>Heritability analysis<SEP>Heritability was calculated using data collected on 169 MZ and 419 DZ pairs of twins from the TwinsUK cohort (total of 1,176 individuals). Twin-based heritability was calculated by fitting an ACE model using the OpenMx package (v.2.8.3), as previously described. Prior to heritability estimation, the taxonomic abundance was normalized using inverse rank sum transformation. Since the NTR cohort comprised only MZ twins, the between-cohort heritability concordance was calculated as the correlation of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for MZ twins. Pearson’s correlation between NTR’s and TwinsUK’s ICCs was used to estimate the concordance. For mbQTLs, SNP-based heritability was calculated by LD score regression using ‘LDSC’ tool.<SEP>Microbiome GWAS analysis<SEP>The modified version of the eQTL mapping pipeline (https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/tree/master/eqtl-mapping-pipeline) was used to perform mbQTL mapping.<SEP>The microbiome GWAS was performed in three ways. First, we performed GWAS on three microbiome alpha diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson and Inverse Simpson), using Spearman correlation between SNP dosages and alpha diversity metrics after adjustment for age, sex, technical covariates and genetic principal components.<SEP>Second, we used Spearman correlation to identify loci that affect the covariate-adjusted abundance of bacterial taxa, excluding samples with zero abundance (mbQTLs).<SEP>Third, we identified the loci associated with probability of presence vs absence of the bacterial taxon (mbBTLs). To perform mbBTL analysis, we used a two-stage approach composed of fast correlation screening followed by logistic regression analysis as a robust method for binary traits GWAS. First, we calculated the Pearson correlation between SNP dosage and bacterial presence encoded as 0/1, without adjusting for any covariate effect and using the previously mentioned eQTL mapping pipeline, and used weighted Z-score meta-analysis to calculate non-centrality for SNP-taxon association. Finally, all SNP-taxon pairs with a first stage meta P-value <1×10−4 were recalculated using multiple logistic regression (R base package, versions from 3.2.0 to 3.5.1 depending on the group) with bacterial presence as an outcome and using SNP dosage along with the list of covariates as predictors. All the mbBTLs that reached nominal genome-wide significance threshold (P<5×10−8) in logistic regression analysis had a Pearson correlation P-value (at first stage) more significant than P<10−6, presuming the completeness of two-stage procedure in revealing genome-wide significant mbBTL using P<10−4 cutoff at the first stage of analysis.<SEP>mbTL meta-analysis<SEP>Meta-analysis was performed using a weighted Z-score method implemented in BinaryMetaAnalyzer (v.1.0.13B available on MiBioGen Cookbook), a part of the eQTL mapping pipeline that was used in large-scale eQTL meta-analyses. Per-cohort, Z-scores were calculated from Spearman correlation p-values using inverse normal transformation, transforming two-tailed p-values to one-tailed p-values and tracing the effect directions using the following formula:  Where sign (RSp) denotes the sign of Spearman correlation, qnorm denotes the quantile function for the normal distribution and P denotes the two-tailed p-value of Spearman correlation. For quantitative mbQTLs, the cohorts were weighted by the square root of the effective sample size (the number of samples having the bacterial taxon). For binary mbQTLs, the square root of the reported cohort size was used as a weighting for each study. The summary statistics generated for mbQTLs also include meta-effect sizes and standard errors. These were generated using the inverse variance weighted meta-analysis method performed on the per-cohort effect sizes and standard errors, backtracked from association Z-scores and minor allele frequencies using the strategy proposed and implemented by Zhu et al, where they also give the detailed derivation of the following equations:   Where, b is the estimated effect size, S is the estimated standard error, p is the allele frequency and n is the sample size.<SEP>Heterogeneity exploration analysis<SEP>Cross-study heterogeneity of the effects of genetic variants in the relative abundance of taxonomical units was assessed using Cochran’s Q-test for heterogeneity, as implemented in METAL v2018–08-28, for all genome-wide significant variants (P<5×10−8) found in our main analysis. To avoid reporting false-positive associations due to different study designs or data collection methods, we used a stringent threshold of P<0.05 to reject the null hypothesis of no heterogeneity. This threshold is conservative considering that several variants were tested simultaneously, and no correction for multiple testing was applied. When there was evidence of heterogeneity, a random effect model was also implemented at the meta-analysis level to confirm the association results, using the metaphor R package v.2.0–0 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metafor/metafor.pdf).<SEP>Additionally, when there was evidence for heterogeneity of a SNP-effect across cohorts, we implemented a meta-regression approach using the same package to assess whether variables such as age, ethnicity or sequenced region could explain the observed effect-size heterogeneity.<SEP>Analysis of SNP–age interaction analysis in the LCT locus<SEP>To discover whether the association of functional SNPs in the LCT locus to the abundance of the Bifidobacterium genus varied between groups of adults and infants, we performed age–SNP interaction analysis in the GEM cohort, which comprises three sub-cohorts that each have a comparable number of individuals above and below puberty age. The age of 17 years was selected to split the cohort into the age groups: adolescents or adults. Since the GEM cohort was composed of three sub-cohorts of different ethnic composition, we evaluated the interaction in both joint analysis and in each subcohort separately, using the following formula:  where Bac is the log-transformed count of genus Bifidobacterium, PC[1–3] are three floats with the first 3 genetic PCs, Cohort is a batch variable that determines the cohort the sample belongs to, SNPdos is a float-encoded dosage of alternative allele, SNPHZ is a Boolean variable describing heterozygosity, SNPGT is a genotype encoded as an unordered factor and Agegroup is a two-level factor (above or below split level). The inclusion of a numeric dosage variable and a Boolean SNPHZ variable allowed us to properly adjust for the recessive effect of the SNP on Bifidobacterium abundance without neglecting SNP imputation uncertainty as embedded in SNP dosage.<SEP>The analysis was then repeated for each GEM subcohort separately, using the same model.<SEP>Association of mbTL-associated taxa with host phenotypes<SEP>Bacterial taxa found to be significantly associated with genetic determinants were correlated with 207 host phenotypes, including the intrinsic host properties, diet, disease and medication information, in the LLD and FGFP cohorts. We used Spearman correlation with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-adjustment for multiple testing to assess the correlation between phenotypes and bacteria that had mbQTLs. For the taxa with mbQTLs, samples with zero abundance were truncated. For the taxa with mbBTLs, the abundance was transformed to a binary trait encoding presence/absence.<SEP>FUMA analyses of meta-analysis results<SEP>Functional mapping and annotation of 30 meta-analysis results were performed with FUMA (v1.3.5), an integrated web-based platform. Summary statistics from the mbQTL analyses for each of the 20 independent association signals were used in the analysis. Genome-wide significant loci and their boundaries were defined as non-overlapping genomic regions that extend across an LD window of r2≥0.4 (based on the 1000G EUR reference panel) from the association signals with P<5.0×10−8. Independent (r2<0.1) lead SNPs from each locus were defined as those most strongly associated with a microbial trait (i.e. with the lowest P value) at the specific region. Multiple risk loci were merged into a single genomic locus if the distance between their LD blocks was <250 kb.<SEP>Functional annotation of all candidate risk SNPs was obtained from different repositories integrated in FUMA. Furthermore, these functionally annotated SNPs were mapped to protein-coding genes using the following two strategies: (1) positional mapping, with the maximum distance of 10 kb to protein-coding genes, and (2) eQTL mapping, using information from data repositories such as GTEx v7 and Blood eQTL browser (http://genenetwork.nl/bloodeqtlbrowser/).<SEP>As the mbBTL mapping procedure provides accurate statistics for only the subset of SNPs (see Microbiome GWAS analyses paragraph), and we thus lack full summary statistics, we only performed positional mapping for mbBTLs, taking in the protein-coding genes within 10 kb distance of the 10 leading SNPs per trait.<SEP>All mapped protein-coding genes were combined into one list for either mbQTL or mbBTL analysis prior to performing GSEA integrated in FUMA. In further investigations, hypergeometric tests of enrichment of all mapped genes were performed not only in tissue-specific (differentially expressed) gene sets, but also in gene sets curated from various sources, e.g. MsigDB. We reported all enriched gene sets (≥2) with an FDR adjusted P-value <0.05.<SEP>PheWAS, genetic correlation and colocalization analysis<SEP>We performed the PheWAS look-ups in the summary statistics results of 4,155 traits collected by the GWASATLAS (http://atlas.ctglab.nl/, accessed on: 25–09-2019) database for the top SNPs per mbQTL locus that were revealed by either mbQTL or mbBTL mapping. GWASATLAS includes 600 traits from the UK Biobank and is enriched with extensive phenotypes on proteomics (n=1124 proteins), hematology (n=36), metabolomics (n=1145 metabolic features) and immune markers (n=241), studied across variable sample sizes. It also contains 1,009 GWASs performed prior to the UK Biobank effort, all categorized under 27 phenotype domains. Next, we tested if any of these 27 domains were enriched by the phenotypes associated to one of the SNPs of interest (using a liberal P-value threshold of 0.05 for the SNP–phenotype association) as compared to the expected distributions under the null hypothesis. In order to obtain the distributions under the null hypothesis, we selected matching 1000 SNPs for each top SNP using SNPSNAP matched by allele frequency, gene density, number of LD pairs and distance from the closest gene.<SEP>We then extracted corresponding results from the GWASATLAS for the matched 30,000 SNPs (1000 matching SNPs per each top mbTL SNP). The enrichment of each domain was tested by comparing the proportions of observed and expected significant results for the SNPs of interest using the prop.test function in R. This resulted in one-sided P-values and odds ratios. Seven domains (Aging, Body structures, Connective tissue, Ear-Nose-Throat, Infection, Muscular and Social Interactions) that included fewer than 20 GWAS tables were excluded from the enrichment tests, resulting in 20 domains. We used a conservative Bonferroni-based P-value threshold of 8.06×10−5 for the enrichment testing, accounting for 20 domains and a total of 30 mbTL top SNPs coming from both the mbQTL and mbBTL mapping. In addition, we performed gene-based PheWAS look-ups in the GWASATLAS for candidate genes of interest within 250 kb around the association peaks, as defined by the FUMA algorithms.<SEP>The genetic correlation between Bifidobacterium and its PheWAS-related traits (from Table S12) was estimated following a LD-score regression approach using the ‘ldsc’ tool. For testing colocalization of the PheWAS signals, we used the approximate Bayes factor approach as implemented by the “coloc.abf” function from the “coloc” library in R, using genetic variants within ±250 kb around the top signals.<SEP>Mendelian Randomization analysis<SEP>MR analyses were performed in R using TwoSampleMR package (v.0.5.5). Causality direction was tested between the microbiome and two data types: (1) autoimmune, cardiovascular, metabolic (including weight-related phenotypes) and psychological diseases (GWAS summary statistics from MRBase) known to be associated with microbiome composition and (2) 42 nutritional phenotypes and alcohol intake frequency from the UK Biobank round 2 (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/).<SEP>For MR analyses, the combined meta-effects and standard errors from inverse variance meta-analysis were used.<SEP>To test if a complex trait affected microbiome composition, we selected independent genetic variants associated with complex traits at the genome-wide significant level (P<5×10−8) and used these as instruments in our MR analyses. For complex diseases, we transformed Odd Ratios (ORs) and C.I. to effect sizes and standard errors using the built-in function of the TwoSampleMR package. To test if microbiome changes were causally linked to complex traits, we first confined ourselves to bacteria with genome-wide significant QTLs. For these, we selected all SNPs with a less stringent cut-off of P<1×10−5 in our MR analyses as instruments. This strategy was used to increase the number of SNPs available in order to perform sensitivity analyses, as shown previously. Independent SNPs were selected as instrumental variables based on r2 < 0.001 in 1000G EUR data, within the TwoSampleMR package. When no shared SNPs were available between exposure and outcome, proxies from the 1000G EUR data (r2 > 0.8) were added. We kept only the results based on at least three shared SNPs. MR causality tests were performed using the Wald ratio, and Wald ratios were meta-analyzed using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. We also estimated the causality using additional methods: the weighted mode method, which provides an alternative approach to IVW; MR-Egger, which estimates the degree of horizontal pleiotropy in the data; and MR PRESSO, which estimates the pleiotropy and corrects for it by removing outliers from the IVW model. We also assessed the heterogeneity of the results using Cochran’s Q statistics and using leave-one-out analyses. We estimated instrument variable (IV) strengths using F statistics: the amount of variance explained by IVs was calculated for each exposure using the TwoSampleMR package (get_r_from_lor function) for binary traits and VPE as defined in Shi et al. F statistics were then calculated as , where r2 is the variance explained, N is the sample size and k is the number of IVs. We kept the results for the conventional threshold of F statistics >10.<SEP>After performing the MR tests, we excluded duplicated GWAS traits, as the same phenotype is often studied in multiple GWAS. To remove the duplicates, we kept the study with the largest sample size among all the tested GWAS studies for each trait.<SEP>After excluding duplicates and tests performed with weak instruments (F statistics <10), we applied a BH correction for multiple testing to the results obtained from the IVW MR test, and subsequently used a stringent filtering procedure on the significant results to avoid false-positives. Specifically, we removed the MR results that were based on fewer than three SNPs and thus could not be further investigated with sensitivity analyses. We also removed the MR results that were not supported by other MR tests (weighted mode method P >0.05, MR PRESSO P>0.05) and those that showed substantial pleiotropy or heterogeneity as estimated by MR-Egger (MR-Egger intercept P<0.05) or MR PRESSO outliers-adjusted test (P>0.05), as well as those where leave-one-out analysis identified one SNP driving the signal (all but one leave-one-out configurations had P<0.05). Of note, MR-Egger slope, which represents the causal estimate, was not used as a filtering step given the reduced power to detect causal effects. It is also worth noting that for all but one of the reported MR results that passed all the filters above, the MR-Egger slope p-value was greater than 0.05, therefore an MR-Egger intercept P<0.05 cannot be used to exclude presence of pleiotropy. Even though many of our MR-Egger intercept results provided little evidence of directional pleiotropy, it is worth noting that a P<0.05 cannot exclude the presence of pleiotropy and requires further understanding of the biological mechanisms underpinning the relationship between genetic variation, the gut microbiome and health outcomes. To exclude more complex causality scenarios, we also removed those results for which the reverse MR P-value was below 0.05. Of note, the causal relationship identified for the microbiome feature class Actinobacteria (as exposure) and ulcerative colitis (outcome) showed a consistent effect direction when using only the only genome-wide significant SNP, but with wider confidence interval (OR=0.40 [95% CI: 0.22–0.71] Pnominal=0.002).","Results<SEP>Landscape of microbiome composition across cohorts<SEP>Our study included cohorts that were heterogeneous in terms of ethnic background, age, male/female ratio and microbiome analysis methodology. Twenty cohorts included samples of single ancestry, namely European (16 cohorts, N=13,266), Middle-Eastern (1 cohort, N=481), East Asian (1 cohort, N=811), American Hispanic/Latin (1 cohort N=1,097) and African American (1 cohort, N=114), whereas four cohorts were multi-ancestry (N=2,571) (see Supplementary Note, Supplementary Tables 1,2).<SEP>Twenty-two cohorts comprised adult or adolescent individuals (N=16,632), and two cohorts consisted of children (N=1,708). The microbial composition was profiled by targeting three distinct variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene: V4 (10,413 samples, 13 cohorts), V3-V4 (4,211 samples, 6 cohorts) and V1-V2 (3,716 samples, 5 cohorts) (Fig. 1a). To account for differences in sequencing depth, all datasets were rarefied to 10,000 reads per sample. Next, we performed taxonomic classification using direct taxonomic binning instead of OTU clustering methods (see Online Methods).<SEP>In general, cohorts varied in their microbiome structure at multiple taxonomic levels (Fig. 1b–g). This variation may largely be driven by the heterogeneity between populations and differences in technical protocols (Supplementary Tables 1–3). Combining all samples (N=18,340) resulted in a total richness of 385 genus-level taxonomic groups that had a relative abundance higher than 0.1% in at least one cohort. This observed total richness appears to be below the estimated saturation level (Fig. 1b), suggesting that a further increase in sample size and a higher sequencing depth are needed to capture the total gut microbial diversity (Fig. 1d). As expected, the core microbiota (the number of bacterial taxa present in over 95% of individuals) decreased with the inclusion of additional cohorts (Fig. 1c, Online Methods). The core microbiota comprise nine genera, of which seven were previously identified as such, plus the genera Ruminococcus and Lachnoclostridium (Fig. 1e). Of these nine genera, the most abundant genus was Bacteroides (18.65% (SD:8.65)), followed by Faecalibacterium (6.19% (SD:2.35)), Blautia (3.36% (SD:2.84)) and Alistipes (3.05% (SD:1.47)). Among the European cohorts that compose the largest genetically and environmentally homogeneous cluster, the core microbiota also included Ruminiclostridium, Fusicatenibacter, Butyricicoccus and Eubacterium, genera which typically produce short-chain fatty acids.<SEP>The DNA extraction method was the principal contributor to heterogeneity, with a non-redundant effect size of 29% on the microbiome variation (measured as average genus abundance per cohort; stepwise distance-based redundancy analysis R2adjDNAext=0.27, Padj=7×10−4) (Supplementary Table 4). Richness and Shannon diversity also differed significantly across cohorts. The cohorts with the lowest richness (HCHS/SOL) and highest diversity (DanFund) used specific DNA extraction kits that were not used by other studies, possibly contributing to their outlying alpha diversities (Fig. 1f,g, Supplementary Table 3). Overall, the 16S rRNA domain sequenced and the DNA extraction methods used, together with cohort ethnicity, accounted for 32.74% of richness variance.<SEP>Given the high heterogeneity of microbial composition across cohorts, we applied both per-cohort and whole study–filters for taxa inclusion in GWAS (see Online Methods).<SEP>Heritability of microbial taxa and alpha diversity<SEP>We performed estimation of heritability (H2) of gut microbiome composition based on the two twin cohorts included in our study (Supplementary Table 5). The TwinsUK cohort, composed of 1,176 samples, including 169 monozygotic (MZ) and 419 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, was used to estimate H2 using the ACE (additive genetic variance (A)/shared environmental factors (C)/non-shared factors plus error (E)) model. The Netherlands Twin Registry (NTR) cohort (only MZ twins, N=312, 156 pairs) was used to replicate the MZ intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). None of the alpha diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson and inverse Simpson) showed evidence for heritability (A<0.01, P=1). Among the 159 bacterial taxa that were present in more than 10% of twin pairs, 19 taxa showed evidence for heritability (Pnominal<0.05) (Fig. 2a). The ICC shows concordance between TwinsUK and NTR for these 19 bacterial taxa (R=0.25, P=0.0018, Fig. 2b).<SEP>The SNP-based heritability calculated from mbQTL summary statistics using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression showed two bacterial taxa, genus Ruminiclostridium 9 and family Peptostreptococcaeae, passing the significance threshold given the number of 211 taxa tested (Z<3.68, Supplementary Table 5). The results of the SNP-based heritability and twin-based heritability showed significant correlation across the tested taxa (R=0.244, P=7.2×10−4).<SEP>Thirty one loci associated with gut microbes through GWAS<SEP>First, we studied the genetic background of the alpha diversity (Simpson, inverse Simpson and Shannon diversity indices). We identified no significant hits in the meta-GWAS (P>5×10−8; Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Fig. 1), which is in line with the observed lack of heritability for these indices.<SEP>Next, we used two separate GWAS meta-analysis approaches to explore the effect of host genetics on the abundance levels (mbQTL) or presence/absence (mbBTL) of bacterial taxa in the gut microbiota (see Online Methods).<SEP>In total, 18,340 samples and 211 taxa were included in the mbQTL mapping analysis (Online Methods, Supplementary Table 3). We identified genetic variants that mapped to 20 distinct genetic loci associated with the abundance of 27 taxa (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. 2,3; Supplementary Table 7, 8). MbBTL mapping covered 177 taxa, and 10 loci were found to be associated with presence/absence of bacterial taxa (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 7, 9). For one taxon, family Peptococcaceae, two independent mbBTLs were detected (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 7). Two out of 30 mbTLs showed heterogeneity in mbTL effect-sizes (Supplementary Note).<SEP>In both the mbQTL and mbBTL mapping, only one out of 31 loci (LCT locus – Bifidobacterium, P=8.63×10−21) passed the strict correction for the number of taxa tested (P<1.95×10−10 for 257 taxa included in the analysis). However, the remaining loci include functionally relevant variants (i.e. the FUT2 gene suggested by earlier studies) and, overall, showed concordance with the heritability of microbial taxa. Seven out of the nine taxa that showed the strongest evidence for heritability in the TwinsUK cohort (P<0.01) also have genome-wide significant mbTLs (Fig. 2b). For the taxa with genome-wide significant mbTLs, the number of independent loci associated with a relaxed threshold of 1×10−5 strongly correlated with heritability significance (R=0.62, P=1.9×10−4, Fig. 2c), suggesting that more mbTLs would be identified for this group of bacteria using a larger sample size.<SEP>LCT mbQTL effect shows age and ethnic heterogeneity<SEP>The strongest association signal was seen for variants located in a large block of about 1.5Mb at 2q21.3, which includes the LCT gene and 12 other protein-coding genes. This locus has previously been associated with the abundance of Bifidobacterium in Dutch, UK and US cohorts. Previous studies have also shown a positive correlation of Bifidobacterium abundance with the intake of milk products, but only in individuals homozygous for the low-function LCT haplotype, thereby indicating that gene–diet interaction regulates Bifidobacterium abundance. In our study, the strongest association was seen for rs182549 (P=1.28×10−20), which is a perfect proxy for the functional LCT variant rs4988235 (r2=0.996, D’=1 in European populations). This association showed evidence for heterogeneity across cohorts (I2=62.73%, Cochran’s Q P=1.4×10−4). A leave-one-out strategy showed that the COPSAC2010 cohort, which includes children 4–6 years of age range, contributed the most to the detected heterogeneity (Fig. 4a,b; Supplementary Table 2). When this study was excluded from the meta-analysis, the heterogeneity was reduced (I2=51.9%, Cochran’s Q P=0.004). A meta-regression analysis showed that linear effects of age and ethnicity accounted for 11.84% of this heterogeneity. Including quadratic and cubic terms of age in the model explained 39.22% of the heterogeneity, and the residual heterogeneity was low (Cochran’s Q P=0.01) (Fig. 4c).<SEP>Following these observations, we decided to investigate the effect of age and ethnicity in the multi-ethnic GEM cohort, comprising 1,243 individuals with an age range between 6 and 35 years, of which nearly half of the participants are 16 years or younger. Our analysis showed a significant SNP–age interaction on the level of Bifidobacterium abundance (P<0.05, see Online Methods). Individuals homozygous for the NC_000002.11:g.136616754CC (rs182549) genotype showed a higher abundance of the genus Bifidobacterium in the adult group, but not in the younger group (Fig. 4d). The age–genotype interaction was significant in the GEM_v12 and GEM_ICHIP subcohorts, both comprising mostly European individuals, while the GEM_v24 cohort, mainly composed of individuals of different Israeli subethnicities (see Online Methods) who live in Israel, showed neither an mbQTL effect (Beta = −0.002 [95%CI: −0.21, 0.21]) nor an interaction with age (P>0.1). The lack of an LCT mbQTL effect in adults was also observed in another Israel cohort in the study (Personalized Nutrition Project (PNP), 481 adults, Beta = −0.20 [95%CI: −0.61, 0.20]). Altogether, the cohorts that reported the lowest LCT effect sizes were the two cohorts of Israeli ethnicity volunteered in Israel (GEM_v24, PNP) and a child cohort (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC), Beta = −0.18 [95%CI: −0.36, −0.01]).<SEP>mbTLs are enriched for genes related to metabolism<SEP>Several loci detected at genome-wide significance level were enriched for genes related to metabolism.<SEP>In the mbQTL analysis, the FUT2-FUT1 locus was associated to the abundance of the Ruminococcus torques genus group, a genus from the Lachnospiraceae family. The leading SNP (rs35866622 for R. torques group, P=2.21×10−8) is a proxy for the functional variant rs601338 (r2=0.8; D’=0.9 in European populations) that introduces a stop-codon in FUT2. Another proxy of the functional FUT2 SNP, rs281377, showed association to the Ruminococcus gnavus genus group in the binary analysis, however this signal was just above the genome-wide significance threshold (P=5.79×10−8) (Supplementary Table 9). FUT2 encodes the enzyme alpha-1,2-fucosyltransferase, which is responsible for the secretion of fucosylated mucus glycans in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Individuals homozygous for the stop-codon (rs601338*A/A, non-secretors) do not express ABO antigens on the intestinal mucosa. We observed that the tagging NC_000019.9:g.49218060C>T (rs35866622 non-secretor) allele was associated with a reduced abundance of the R. torques group and a decreased presence of the R. gnavus group. Ruminococcus sp. are specialized in the degradation of complex carbohydrates, thereby supporting a link between genetic variation in the FUT2 gene, levels of mucus glycans and the abundance of this taxa. When assessing the link between this variant and phenotypes in the LifeLines-DEEP (LLD; N=875) and Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP, N=2,259) cohorts (Online Methods), the strongest correlation for the R. torques group was seen with fruit intake (LLD: RSp=−0.19, Padj=3.1×10−5; FGFP: RSp=−0.10, Padj=1.4×10−4, Supplementary Table 10, 11), in line with the association of FUT2 with food preferences, as discussed in the results of the PheWAS (see below).<SEP>Several other suggestive mbQTLs can be linked to genes potentially involved in host–microbiome crosstalk. One of them includes three SNPs in 9q21 (top-SNP rs602075, P=3.57×10−8) associated with abundance of Allisonella. The 9q21 locus includes the genes PCSK5, RFK and GCNT1, of which RFK encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and GCNT1 encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in biosynthesis of mucin. These products play major roles in the host–microbiota interactions within the intestine, where they are used by bacteria for their metabolism and involved in the regulation of the host immune defense. Another association signal 10p13 (rs61841503, P=9.8×10−9), which affects the abundance of the heritable family Peptostreptococcaceae, is located in the CUBN gene, the receptor for the complexes of cobalamin (vitamin B12) with gastric intrinsic factor (the complex required for absorption of cobalamin). CUBN is expressed in the kidneys and the intestinal epithelium and is associated with B12-deficient anemia and albuminuria. Cobalamin is required for host–microbial interactions, and supplementation with cobalamin induced a substantial shift in the microbiota composition of an in vitro colon model. These associations suggest that some members of the gut microbiome community might be affected by genetic variants that regulate the absorption and metabolism of vitamins B2 and B12.<SEP>Among mbBTLs, the strongest evidence for association was seen for a block of 10 SNPs (rs7574352, P=1.42×10−9) associated with the family Peptococcaceae, a taxon negatively associated with stool levels of the gut inflammation markers chromogranin A (LLD: RSp=−0.31, Padj=4.4×10−18, Table S10) and calprotectin (LLD: RSp=−0.11, Padj=0.058) and with ulcerative colitis (FGFP: RSp=−0.06, Padj=0.09, Table S11). The association block is located in the intergenic region in the proximity (220kb apart) of IRF1, which is involved in insulin resistance and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.<SEP>Other highlights of identified mbTLs are given in the Supplementary Note.<SEP>GSEA, FUMA and PheWAS analysis<SEP>To explore the potential functions of the identified mbTLs, we performed FUMA (Functional Mapping and Annotation of GWAS, see Online Methods), GSEA and PheWAS, followed by Bayesian colocalization analysis and genetic correlation of Bifidobacterium abundance to its PheWAS-related traits. FUMA of 20 mbQTL loci returned 139 positional and eQTL genes. GSEA on these genes suggested an enrichment for genes expressed in the small intestine (terminal ileum) and brain (substania nigra and putamen basal ganglia) (Supplementary Fig. 4). The positional candidates for mbBTLs did not show any enrichment in GSEA analysis.<SEP>To systematically assess the biological outcomes of the mbTLs, we looked up the 31 mbTLs in the summary statistics for 4,155 complex traits and diseases using the GWAS ATLAS. Five out of 31 leading SNPs were associated with one or more phenotypes at P<5×10−8 (Supplementary Table 12): rs182549 (LCT) and rs35866622 (FUT1/FUT2), followed by rs4428215 (FNDC3B), rs11647069 (PM FBP1) and rs9474033 (PKHD1).<SEP>The variant showing highest pleiotropy, rs182549 (LCT, Bifidobacterium), was associated with multiple dietary and metabolic phenotypes, and the causal involvement of the SNP across pairs of traits was confirmed by colocalization test (PP.H4.abf > 0.9) for 49 out of 51 tested phenotypes. The NC_000002.11:g.136616754=(rs182549) allele, which predisposes individuals to lactose intolerance, was negatively associated with obesity and positively associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosis (OR=1.057 [95%CI:1.031, 1.085], P=1.74×10−5), family history of T2DM (paternal: OR=1.054 [95%CI:1.035, 1.073], P=1.41×10−8; maternal: OR=1.035 [95%CI:1.016, 1.053], P=0.0002, siblings: OR=1.03 [95%CI:1.009, 1.052]), and several nutritional phenotypes in the UK Biobank cohort. Moreover, the functional LCT SNP rs4988235 variant is associated with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (P=4.23×10−28), an indicator of glycemic variability. There was a nominally significant correlation of Bifidobacterium with raw vegetable intake (rg=0.36, P=0.0016), but this correlation was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.<SEP>NC_000019.9:g.49218060=(rs35866622, FUT1/FUT2 locus) was positively associated with fish intake and height. The secretor allele was negatively associated with the risks of cholelithiasis and Crohn’s disease, alcohol intake frequency, high cholesterol and waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted for body mass index (BMI), with PP.H4.abf > 0.9).<SEP>Consistent with the single SNP analysis, gene-based PheWAS also showed a strong link of the LCT locus with metabolic traits (e.g. P=5.7×10−9 for BMI), whereas several nutritional (e.g. P=1.26×10−20 for oily fish intake), immune-related (e.g. P=1.73×10−12 for mean platelet volume), gastrointestinal (e.g. P=8.77×10−14 for cholelithiasis) and metabolic signals (e.g. P=1.13×10−13, high cholesterol) mapped to the FUT1/FUT2 locus (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 13).<SEP>Finally, we performed a phenotype domain enrichment analysis (Online Methods). We observed that top loci were enriched with signals associated with the metabolic domain supported by 4 mbTLs, followed by nutritional, cellular, immunological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, respiratory and reproductive traits, and the activities domain (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 14).<SEP>Mendelian Randomization analysis<SEP>To identify the potential causal links between gut microbial taxa and phenotypes, we performed bi-directional two-sample MR analyses using the TwoSampleMR package. We focused on two groups of phenotypes: diseases (autoimmune, cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric) and nutritional phenotypes. The complexity of the mechanisms by which host genetics affect microbiome composition, and the limited impact of genetic variants on microbial taxa variability, require caution when performing and interpreting causality estimation using MR analysis. We therefore carried out several sensitivity analyses and excluded any results that showed evidence of being confounded by pleiotropy (Online Methods). Only pairs supported by three or more SNPs were considered. With these strict cut-offs, no evidence for causal relationships between microbiome taxa and dietary preferences was identified (Supplementary Tables 15, 16). However, our results suggest that a higher abundance of the class Actinobacteria and its genus Bifidobacterium may have a protective effect on ulcerative colitis (Actinobacteria: OR=0.56 [95%CI: 0.44–0.71] for each SD increase in bacterial abundance, PBHadj=8.8×10−4; Bifidobacterium: OR=0.51 [95%CI: 0.39–0.71], PBHadj=9.8×10−5) (Fig. 6a,b). We also observed that higher abundance of family Oxalobacteraceae has a protective effect on rheumatoid arthritis (OR=0.82, [95%CI: 0.74–0.91], PBHadj=0.028, Fig. 6c).","Discussion<SEP>We report here on the relationship between host genetics and gut microbiome composition in 18,340 individuals from 24 population-based cohorts of European, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Asian and African ancestries. We have estimated the heritability of the human gut microbiome and the effect of host genetics on the presence and abundance of individual microbial taxa. We studied the heterogeneity of the mbTL signals and characterized the impact of technical and biological factors on their effect magnitude. In addition, we explored the relevance of the identified mbTLs to health-related traits using GSEA, PheWAS and MR approaches.<SEP>Our large, multi-ethnic study allowed for an informative investigation of the human gut microbiome. However, there was large heterogeneity in the data, which reflects biological differences across the cohorts and methodological differences in the processing of samples. Overall, seven different methods of fecal DNA extraction and three different 16S rRNA regions were used. In addition, differences in the ethnicities, ages and BMIs of the participants led to a remarkable variation in microbiome richness, diversity and composition across cohorts. Diet, medication and lifestyle, among other factors, are known to influence the microbiome but were not included in our analysis because this data were not available for all cohorts. Large variation in the microbiome composition may have reduced the power of our mbTL analysis (see Supplementary Note).<SEP>We did not detect a host genetic effect on bacterial diversity, in line with a lack of its detectable heritability. Thirty-one taxon-specific mbTLs (20 mbQTLs and 11 mbBTLs) were identified at P<5×10−8. Even with our large sample size, the number of mbTLs identified is rather modest. Only the association of LCT locus with Bifidobacterium (P=1.28×10−20) passed the conservative study-wide significance threshold of P>1.95×10−10. However, we observed that heritable taxa tend to have more genome-wide significant loci and suggestively associated loci, and twin-based heritability is significantly correlated with SNP-based heritability. Our results confirm that only a subset of gut bacteria is heritable, and that the genetic architecture affecting the abundance of heritable taxa is complex and polygenic.<SEP>The association between the LCT locus and the Bifidobacterium genus was the strongest in our study. It has been shown that the functional SNP in the LCT locus, rs4988235, determines not only the abundance of the Bifidobacterium genus, but also the strength of the association between this genus and milk/dairy product intake. Here, we showed the ethnic heterogeneity and age-dependent nature of the LCT-Bifidobacterium association – the effect is weaker in children and adolescents – consistent with existing knowledge on lactose intolerance. The strongest mbQTL effect was observed in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) cohort that comprises individuals of Hispanic/Latin American ethnicity and shows the highest prevalence of the lactose intolerant NC_000002.11:g.136616754CC (rs182549) genotype (683 out of 1,097 individuals).<SEP>To explore the potential functional effects of mbTLs on health-related traits, we used GSEA, PheWAS and MR approaches. The GSEA indicated enrichment of mbQTLs for genes expressed in the small intestine and brain. These results support the existence of the gut–brain axis mediated by microbiome and likely influencing gastrointestinal, brain and mood disorders. In addition, the PheWAS analysis identified a significant overlap between the genetic variants affecting gut microbes and a broad range of host characteristics, including psychiatric, metabolic and immunological traits, and nutritional preferences, amongst other phenotype groups (Supplementary Table 14). Moreover, genetic determinants of bacterial abundance are involved in regulating host metabolism, particularly obesity-related traits. Among the interesting bacteria, earlier studies have linked the relative abundances of Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae to obesity. PheWAS analysis also indicated that SNPs from the LCT and FUT2 loci that associated with bacterial taxa are also associated to dietary preference factors, including fish, cereal, bread, alcohol, vegetable and ground coffee intake, along with other dietary phenotypes. Interestingly, other genes found to be associated with mbTLs also included olfactory receptors (OR1F1) and genes involved in the absorption and metabolism of B2 and B12 vitamins (RFK and CUBN).<SEP>Genetic anchors to microbiome variation also allow for estimation of causal links with complex traits through MR approaches. MR results indicate that Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium might have a protective effect in ulcerative colitis. Cross-sectional studies have reported an increased abundance of Actinobacteria in healthy individuals as compared to inflammatory bowel disease patients, although these results have not always been consistent. Bifidobacterium was also previously shown to have a beneficial effect on ulcerative colitis in a clinical trial. We also revealed that abundance of family Oxalobacteraceae in the gut microbiome might be protective for rheumatoid arthritis; the abundance of this family in lung was previously shown to be negatively associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Protective effects of the bacterial taxa on these diseases support the potential of microbiome-based therapy.<SEP>In summary, we report the largest study to date to investigate the genetics of human microbiome across multiple ethnicities. Microbiome heterogeneity and high inter-individual variability substantially reduces the statistical power of microbiome-wide analyses: similar to earlier microbiome GWAS studies, we report a limited number of associated loci. Nevertheless, our results point to causal relationships between specific loci, bacterial taxa and health-related traits. Heritability estimates suggest that these associations are likely part of a larger spectrum that is undetectable in the current study sample size. This warrants future studies that should take advantage of larger sample sizes, harmonized protocols and more advanced microbiome analysis methods, including metagenomics sequencing instead of 16S profiling and quantification of bacterial cell counts. Given the essential role of the gut microbiome in the metabolism of food and drugs, our results contribute to the development of personalized nutrition and medication strategies based on both host genomics and microbiome data.",50953,"['OBWCCE', 'FOODIN', 'FOODAL']"
30728219,"Introduction<SEP>Eating healthily on a daily basis is a major step to prevent development of type 2 diabetes. Higher intake of dairy products has been associated with a lower risk of diabetes in a meta-analysis of observational studies. Particularly yoghurt and cheese intake were associated with lower diabetes risk, whereas milk intake was not, with substantial heterogeneity for most dairy products. In European populations, a direct association between milk intake and risk of diabetes was suggested, but this was not statistically significant. Protective components of dairy products may be whey-proteins, odd-chain fatty acids, and the high nutrient density of dairy. Also, interactions within the dairy food matrix may modify the metabolic effects of dairy consumption.<SEP>However, potential confounding and reverse causation cannot be excluded. Due to these limitations, the causal role of dairy products in diabetes prevention remains debatable.<SEP>The relationship between dairy products and risk of diabetes could be investigated by applying a Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach, using genetic variability in the MCM6 gene associated to lactase persistence (LP) in adults as an instrumental variable (IV). Lactase is necessary to break down the sugars that are found in dairy products, i.e. lactose. SNPs in the MCM6 region have been associated to LP. rs4988235 (LCT-12910C>T) has been associated to LP in European populations, and has been associated to a higher intake of milk in European cohorts, albeit not in all.<SEP>Previous MR studies reported no association between LP associated milk intake and diabetes. However, variation in the MCM6 gene is likely to lead to population stratification, which would introduce bias to an MR analysis, and previous MR studies did not sufficiently adjust for population substructure. Also, previous studies did not investigate whether rs4988235 was specifically associated with dairy product intake after adjusting for population substructure.<SEP>We therefore investigated whether rs4988235 associated with intake of dairy products and other foods in a pan-European study in 8 countries with different dietary habits. We adjusted for genetic principal components and study centre to adjust for population substructure. Next, we used rs4988235 in an IV analysis to investigate if there is a causal relationship between the LP associated exposure and risk of diabetes.","Research Design and Methods<SEP>Study design and population<SEP>EPIC-InterAct is a prospective case-cohort study nested within eight European countries of the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study. From 340,234 adults of the EPIC study for whom baseline blood samples were available, EPIC-InterAct randomly selected a subcohort of 16,154 participants and identified 12,403 incident cases of type 2 diabetes between 1991 and 2007, including 778 cases from the subcohort by design.<SEP>We excluded 5,287 participants that were not successfully genotyped (14% of samples had no DNA, 58% had insufficient DNA, 8% failed initial PCR and 20% failed array-based genotyping). Of the 5,287 participants that failed genotyping, 57% developed diabetes during follow-up, versus 55% of 22,492 participants that were successfully genotyped.<SEP>We additionally excluded participants with missing information on dairy product intake (n=592) and one participant per set of relatives (identity by descent > 0.1875, n=80), leading to a total population of 21,820 (Supplemental Figure 1).<SEP>Genotyping and GWAS search<SEP>DNA was extracted from buffy coat from a citrated blood sample on an automated Autopure LS DNA extraction system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with PUREGENE chemistry (Qiagen). Participant samples were genotyped with the Illumina HumanCore Exome Chip arrays 12v1 or 24v1 (n=12,792) or with the Illumina 660W QuadBeadChip (n=8,955). Sample exclusion criteria were low call rate (threshold <95.4% in Illumina 660,<98% in core exome arrays), discordance between self-reported sex and sex based on X chromosome heterozygosity, outliers for heterozygosity, lack of concordance with previous genotyping results or non-European genetic ancestry.<SEP>Before imputation, SNPs were filtered to remove those with minor allele count <2, call rate <95% or Hardy Weinberg p-value <1e-6. Imputation to the Haplotype Reference Consortium v1.0 panel using IMPUTE v2.3.2 was performed at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics.<SEP>For the present analyses, we used the imputed LP SNP rs4988235 (LCT-12910C>T). Imputation info, a measure that reflects certainty of imputation, was 0.89 on the Illumina 660W quad chip and 0.45 on the Illumina HumanCore Exome chip for rs4988235.<SEP>Phenoscanner was used to search for phenotypes that have been associated with rs4988235 or its proxies (R2 >0.8) in previous GWAS. These phenotypes could be mediators of an association between milk intake and diabetes, but could also indicate pleiotropy. Pleiotropy occurs when genetic variation affects two or more phenotypic traits that are seemingly unrelated and can lead to violation of assumptions made in MR studies. The effect allele (T) of rs4988235 has been associated (at p<5*10-8) with a larger hip circumference, taller height and lower LDL and total cholesterol (Supplemental Table 1). We did not find evidence of an association between rs4988235 and phenotypes that are unrelated to dairy product intake.<SEP>Dietary measurement<SEP>Dietary intake over the previous twelve months before study inclusion was assessed at baseline through diet questionnaires, which varied per country or study centre. These questionnaires were developed to reflect local eating habits and validated locally.<SEP>Information on intake of milk ((semi-)skimmed or full-fat, regardless of fermentation), yoghurt and thick fermented milk (e.g. sour milk) and cheese was available for the full subcohort (n=12,722). Availability of consumption data for other dairy products differed by country and/or centre, depending on the cohort-specific questionnaire. Information on intake of dairy creams (e.g. whipped cream), curd (e.g. quark, cottage cheese), milk based puddings (e.g. custard), milk beverages (e.g. chocolate milk), and milk for coffee and creamers was available for 11,536, 10,372, 10,372, 6,867 and 2,959 subcohort participants, respectively. Information on consumption of non-milk dairy was calculated by summing intake of all dairy products other than milk.<SEP>Measurement of fatty acids has been described in detail previously. In short, fatty acids C15:0 and C17:0 were measured in phospholipids in plasma samples that were stored at baseline at −196°C or −150°C, using gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) equipped with flame ionisation detection.<SEP>Covariates<SEP>Baseline information on education, lifestyle and medical history was obtained from self-administered questionnaires. Weight and height and hip and waist circumference were measured during a visit to a study centre. Body mass index, (BMI, weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2)) and waist-hip ratio (WHR, waist circumference/hip circumference) were calculated, adjusted for clothing by subtracting 1.5 kg for weight and 2.0 cm for circumferences for people that were normally dressed without shoes. Physical activity was classified as inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, and active, according to the Cambridge Physical Activity Index.<SEP>The lipids HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein (a) were measured in serum using a Cobas enzymatic assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) on a Roche Hitachi Modular P analyser. LDL-cholesterol was calculated by Friedewald equation.<SEP>Erythrocyte HbA1c was measured using Tosoh (HLC-723G8) ion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography on a Tosoh G8.<SEP>Diabetes<SEP>Ascertainment of incident type 2 diabetes has been described previously and involved a review of the existing EPIC datasets at each centre using multiple sources of evidence, including self-report, linkage to primary- and secondary-care registers, drug registers, hospital admissions and mortality data. To increase specificity of case definition, confirmation of type 2 diabetes diagnosis was sought where there was only one source of evidence, including individual medical records review in some centres. Follow-up was censored at date of diagnosis, 31 December 2007 or the date of death, whichever occurred first.<SEP>Data analysis<SEP>Baseline characteristics and dietary intakes of the subcohort and by most probable rs4988235 genotype were presented as percentages, mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (p25-p75). We additionally reported dietary intakes per country. Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) based on most probable LP genotype was examined in the subcohort, and after stratification to country.<SEP>We first checked two IV assumptions, namely if the IV is reliably associated with exposure (rs4988235 and intake of dairy products), and if the IV is independent of confounders of the exposure-outcome relationship (rs4988235 and intake of other foods, and diabetes risk factors). The third IV assumption is that the IV solely influences the outcome via a causal pathway that includes the exposure of interest, and cannot be checked. IV assumptions were checked only in subcohort participants, because the subcohort is population-based. We then proceeded to the IV analysis in the full case-cohort to answer the main research question: Is there a causal relationship between dairy product intake and risk of diabetes? (rs4988235 and risk of diabetes and MR analysis)<SEP>rs4988235 and intake of dairy products<SEP>rs4988235 was modelled continuously with SNP dosage, assuming an additive effect of LP alleles. Linear regression was used to examine the association between LP and dairy products. If rs4988235 was associated with multiple dairy products, the association between the LP SNP and a composite dairy product exposure (e.g. milk and milk beverages) was examined. The model with the highest F statistic was used for subsequent IV analyses. The F statistic is often used to assess the risk of weak instrument bias in MR studies, but simulation studies have shown that bias when using one IV is very low, even for expected F statistics around 5.<SEP>To support results based on diet questionnaire data, we also performed a linear regression between rs4988235 and plasma levels of saturated fats C15:0 and C17:0. These fatty acids are mainly found in dairy products, and plasma measurements of C15:0 and C17:0 have previously been associated to dairy product intake, although there seems to be some endogenous production of these fatty acids as well.<SEP>We adjusted for the first three genetic principal components (PC), study centre, genotyping platform, sex and age in the linear regression models.<SEP>rs4988235 and diabetes risk factors<SEP>To examine potential pleiotropy of rs4988235 in EPIC-InterAct, we investigated the relationship between rs4988235 and baseline lifestyle factors, anthropometric measurements and blood lipids. These phenotypes could either be intermediates in the causal chain of an association between milk intake and diabetes, or pleiotropic effects of the LP SNP.<SEP>Linear regression was used for continuous variables and logistic regression for dichotomous variables. Triglycerides and lipoprotein a were log transformed before analysis. Analyses were adjusted for genotyping platform, sex, age, first three genetic PC and study centre.<SEP>The avoidance or consumption of dairy products may have consequences for the whole dietary pattern. More specifically, if a person avoids dairy products, this could lead to a reduction in total energy intake, or replacement of dairy by other beverages or foods, or a combination of the two scenarios. It is also possible that dairy products are consumed together with other beverages or foods.<SEP>We therefore investigated the relationship between rs4988235 and dietary intake of whole foods other than dairy, using linear regression in an identical manner as for dairy products. We did not correct for multiple testing in the analysis of these closely related dietary exposures.<SEP>rs4988235 and risk of diabetes and MR analysis<SEP>First, we investigated if rs4988235 was related to HbA1c levels in the subcohort through linear regression, adjusting for genotyping platform, sex, age, first three genetic PC and study centre. The relationship between rs4988235 and risk of incident diabetes was examined per country through a Prentice-weighted Cox regression, using age as underlying time scale, with adjustment for genotyping platform, sex, age, the first three genetic PC and study centre. Country-specific results were pooled with inverse variance weights in a random effect meta-analysis using restricted maximum likelihood estimation.<SEP>We then performed the MR analysis, a two stage least squares (2SLS) IV analysis. LP associated dairy product intake for each participant was calculated by using rs4988235, genotyping platform, sex, age, the first three genetic PC and study centre as predictors in a linear regression model. Next, we investigated the association between predicted dairy product intake and diabetes in a Prentice-weighed Cox regression per country and subsequently pooled results. We investigated associations per 15 gram of genetically predicted dairy intake to obtain interpretable 95% confidence intervals.<SEP>Because a regular 2SLS IV analysis does not take variance of the gene-exposure association into account and this could influence our findings, we additionally performed the MR analysis among 10,000 bootstrap samples and obtained a 95% confidence interval through the percentile method. Also, we repeated MR analysis under the assumption of dominance of LP, after exclusion of non-cases with an HbA1c> 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at baseline, in participants from countries where rs4988235 was in HWE, and in participants genotyped on the Illumina 660W quad chip. All analysis were performed in R version 3.4.1.","Results<SEP>The subcohort consisted of 12,722 participants with an average age of 52 (SD 9) years and 61.6% was female. In EPIC-InterAct, median milk intake was 162 (p25-p75 27-300) g/day and non-consumption of milk was rare (7.1%) (Table 1). Milk intake differed between countries, ranging from 15 (0-150) g/day in France to 200 (107-307) g/day in the United Kingdom. Non-consumption of milk ranged from 47.6% in France to 0% in Denmark (Supplemental Table 2-5).<SEP>Prevalence of homozygous LP (rs4988235 T/T genotype) differed within Europe with a range from 7.4% in Italy to 53.9% in Sweden (Supplemental Table 6). LP SNP genotypes were in HWE in the total subcohort, but deviation from HWE at a p<0.05 significance level was observed in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark (Supplemental Table 6). Baseline characteristics of the subcohort by rs4988235 genotype showed that with increasing number of LP (T) alleles, participants were older, had a higher systolic blood pressure, were more physically active and highly educated (Supplemental Table 7). Also consumption of dairy products, potatoes, margarine, sugar, non-alcoholic beverages and coffee was higher, whereas intake of pasta/rice, cereal products, fruit, vegetables, legumes and vegetable oils was lower (Supplemental Table 8).<SEP>rs4988235 and intake of dairy products and other foods<SEP>After adjustment for sex, age, principal components, study centre and genotyping platform, one additional LP allele was associated with a higher intake of milk (β 17.1 g/day, 95%CI 10.6 to 23.6) and milk beverages (β 2.8 g/day, 95%CI 1.0 to 4.5), but not with intake of other dairy products (Table 2). F statistic of the model predicting milk intake was 74.0, and predicting a composite endpoint of milk and milk beverages intake decreased the F statistic to 64.5.<SEP>rs4988235 was associated with higher plasma C15:0 (β 0.003 % of total fats, 95%CI 0.0005 to 0.005). A similar association was suggested for C17:0 levels (β 0.002 % of total fats, 95% CI -0.0007 to 0.005), but this was not statistically significant.<SEP>rs4988235 and diabetes risk factors<SEP>rs4988235 was associated with a modestly lower HDL cholesterol (β -0.017, 95%CI -0.029 to -0.004). After multivariable adjustment, dietary intakes associated with rs4988235 were potatoes (β 3.0, 95%CI 0.9 to 5.1), cereal (β -3.5, 95% CI -6.7 to -0.3), fruits (β -7.0, 95%CI -12.4 to -1.7), poultry (β -0.8, 95%CI -1.4 to -0.2), non-alcoholic beverages (β -18.0, 95%CI -34.4 to -1.6) and wine (β -4.8, 95%CI -9.1 to -0.6) (Table 2). rs4988235 was not associated with energy intake.<SEP>rs4988235 and risk of diabetes and MR analysis<SEP>rs4988235 was not associated with baseline HbA1c levels (β -0.07 %, 95%CI -0.22 to 0.07, n=12,519), nor with risk of developing diabetes (HRper additional LP allele 0.99, 95%CI 0.94,1.04). MR analysis suggested no association between milk intake and diabetes (HR 0.99per 15 g/day, 95%CI 0.93 to 1.05, I2 = 44%) (Table 4, Supplemental Figure 2).<SEP>Results did not differ when repeating the IV analysis among 10,000 bootstrap samples (HRper 15 g/day 0.99, 95%CI 0.94 to 1.04) and assuming a dominant effect of LP did not alter conclusions (HRper 15 g/day 0.99, 95%CI 0.92-1.07). Restricting analysis to participants genotyped on the Illumina Human Quad 660 chip did not change conclusions, nor did excluding 73 participants with an HbA1c> 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or limiting analysis to countries in HWE (Supplemental Table 9).",,17615,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS', 'FOODIN']"
29750367,"Introduction<SEP>Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been linked to a broad range of deficits in growth and neurobehavioral function, collectively referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which comprise the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities worldwide. Prevalence estimates range from 1.1–5.0% in the US to 13.6–20.9% in South Africa. Fetal alcohol-related effects are seen on pre- and postnatal growth, IQ, and learning and memory. In infancy, PAE has been linked to poorer performance on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) and recognition memory and slower information processing.<SEP>We have identified a strikingly consistent effect of PAE on eyeblink conditioning (EBC), a culturally-neutral, Pavlovian paradigm that involves contingent temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (e.g., auditory tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., air puff). In our Cape Town, South Africa, cohort, not a single child with full FAS met criterion for conditioning at age 5 years, compared with 75% of non-exposed controls. Two-thirds of the other heavily exposed children also failed to meet criterion for conditioning. PAE-related EBC impairment was seen again in these children at 10 years, in a second Cape Town cohort at 11 years, and in an independent study of school-age children in the U.S..<SEP>The neural circuitry involved in EBC has been documented across a range of animal species and across the life-span. By 5 months postpartum, typically-developing human infants reach the same terminal level in delay EBC as adults. Heavy alcohol exposure during the equivalent of the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in humans disrupts EBC in weanling rats and adults, a deficit that is mediated by dose-dependent cell loss and altered neural activity in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Binge exposure during this period in rodents is also associated with loss of Purkinje and granule cells in the cerebellum. Neuroimaging studies of humans, using functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, have documented adverse effects of PAE on structure and function of the neural network known to support EBC.<SEP>We have been conducting longitudinal research on children and mothers recruited during pregnancy in a Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town since 1999. Despite widely disseminated public health advisories, including educational brochures and posters in antenatal clinics, information about risks of pregnancy drinking provided by nurse/midwives, and numerous psychosocial community-based interventions, heavy drinking during pregnancy continues to be highly prevalent in this community. Given the limited effectiveness of these interventions, there is a critical need for pharmacological and/or nutritional treatments that may mitigate the teratogenic effects of alcohol.<SEP>Laboratory studies have shown that choline supplementation in rats has remarkable potential to mitigate effects of PAE on a range of behavioral outcomes, including working memory, spatial learning and hyperactivity, and reversal learning, and trace fear conditioning. The beneficial effects of choline supplementation early in development persisted even after treatment was completed, indicating long-lasting changes in central nervous system organization and development. have demonstrated that choline supplementation also mitigates alcohol’s effects on trace EBC. The deficit in acquisition of conditioned responses (CRs) seen in alcohol-exposed rats was not seen in the alcohol-exposed group treated with choline, which performed as well as non-exposed controls. Choline was administered during the equivalent of the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in these studies. When administered earlier in pregnancy, treatment is even more effective in enhancing cognition in typically developing rats and can mitigate effects on brain and body weight, reflexes, and motor coordination in alcohol-exposed rats.<SEP>Choline, an essential nutrient that is a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, plays an important role in cell membrane integrity, trans-membrane signaling, and lipid and cholesterol transport and metabolism. It also serves as a methyl-group donor needed for homocysteine metabolism and DNA methylation, a critical mechanism in epigenetic processes that have been implicated in alcohol teratogenesis. Choline is derived from dietary intake, principally eggs, liver, wheat germ, and milk, and from endogenous synthesis, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT). A common SNP variant (rs12325817) in the promoter region of the PEMT gene confers a markedly higher risk for choline deficiency. Choline dietary intake in pregnant women is often much lower than the 450 mg/d recommended by the. U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data show that only 7% of women achieve the adequate intake (AI) level for choline. In the U.S., the lowest quartile of choline intake in women of reproductive age is 25–50% of the AI, and in developing countries, including South Africa, choline intake is even lower.<SEP>In a previous paper (Jacobson et al., submitted), we have reported findings from a pilot, randomized placebo-controlled trial demonstrating the acceptability and feasibility of a maternal choline supplementation intervention for heavy drinking women during pregnancy. In this paper, we report our results relating to the efficacy of this intervention. The aims of this study were to assess (1) the efficacy of prenatal choline supplementation in mitigating adverse effects of PAE on our primary outcome, EBC, and (2) efficacy in mitigating deficits in three secondary outcomes—pre- and postnatal growth restriction, recognition memory, and information processing speed. We also examined the effects of choline on FASD diagnosis and the degree to which choline supplementation is particularly effective in women with choline deficient diets and in women who carry the rs12325817 variant of the enzyme PEMT, which limits endogenous choline synthesis.","Methods<SEP>Trial Design<SEP>Women were randomly assigned to either choline supplementation or placebo using a randomization list with variable blocks of 2 and 4 subjects and 1:1 allocation ratio generated by a biostatistician not otherwise involved in the trial. All investigators and research staff remained blind to the participants’ treatment groups throughout the trial.<SEP>Participants<SEP>Recruitment occurred between April 2012 and September 2014; the last infant was born in January 2015. 69 women from the Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) community participated in the trial. Procedures for recruitment, ascertainment of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and randomization are detailed in Jacobson et al. (submitted). Briefly, maternal alcohol consumption was assessed using a timeline follow-back (TLFB) interview. Heavy drinking during pregnancy was defined as an average of at least 2 standard drinks (1.0 oz absolute alcohol (AA))/day or 2 or more incidents of binge drinking (4 or more drinks/occasion). Maternal exclusionary criteria were weeks gestation at recruitment >23; age <18 years; HIV or syphilis infection; multiple-gestation pregnancy; pharmacologic treatment for a serious pre-existing medical condition (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, or cardiac problems); use of methamphetamine, a popular drug at the time of recruitment; plans to leave Cape Town before study completion; and dietary choline intake ≥1.5g/day, assessed prior to randomization using a quantitative choline food frequency questionnaire (QFFQ) developed for this study (Carter et al., submitted). Infant exclusionary criteria were major chromosomal anomalies, neural tube defects, seizures, very low birth weight (<1500 g), and gestational age (GA) <32 weeks.<SEP>Human subjects approval was obtained from the Wayne State University, University of Cape Town (UCT) Faculty of Health Sciences, and Columbia University Medical Center Institutional Review Boards, and the South African Medicines Control Council. Informed consent was obtained from each mother and the father, if available. An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB), comprised of a developmental psychologist, obstetrician, neonatologist, and statistician, met with SWJ, RCC, CDM, and JLJ via telephone/Skype prior to the initiation of the trial to review the research plan and every 9 months thereafter to review the progress of the trial and any study-related adverse events.<SEP>Treatment Protocol<SEP>Each participant was instructed to take 2 daily doses (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening) from time of enrollment until delivery. Each choline supplement dose consisted of 1.25g choline bitartrate, which contained 1g of bioavailable choline cation. The daily choline dose of 2g was chosen in consultation with SZ to maximize potential benefit while being well within the parameters for maternal and fetal safety during pregnancy based on the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for choline determined by the (see Jacobson et al., submitted). Each dose consisted of an individually wrapped packet of powder that, when mixed with 8 oz of water, results in a sweet tasting, slightly fizzy, grape-flavored drink. The choline supplement and placebo were indistinguishable in terms of taste, smell, and appearance. When the participant was given the packets, CDM cautioned her that taking the drink mix would not make it safe to drink alcohol during pregnancy. At the initiation of the trial, the mother was given a box with a 1-month supply of drink packets. At the end of each month, the nurse collected the box (with used and unused packets), replacing it with a new 1-month supply, and number of packets used was tabulated in our laboratory. Adherence was good-to-excellent (median doses taken=74.0%; interquartile range=53.9–88.7) for most participants, and poor adherence (≤33.0%) was relatively rare (11.3% of participants). Plasma choline concentrations increased significantly more in the choline supplementation arm over the course of the trial than in the placebo arm (group by treatment phase interaction, t(105)=3.36, p=0.001; see Fig. 4 in Jacobson et al. (in press).<SEP>Maternal Assessments<SEP>The TLFB interview was re-administered at 4- and 12-weeks following randomization, and data from the three interviews were averaged to provide continuous measures of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Alcohol abuse and/or dependence was diagnosed based on DSM-IV criteria using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Extensive information was also collected regarding sociodemographic background and illicit drug use. Nutritional status was assessed using a multiple-pass 24-hr dietary recall interview. Adequate dietary caloric intake was defined as average daily nutrient intake (adjusted using the Nutrition Research Council [NRC] method,) below the estimated energy requirement for energy or, for nutrients, the estimated average requirement (EAR) or, where no EAR is available, the AI. Dietary choline intake was assessed on the QFFQ prior to initiation of and twice during the trial. Adequate choline intake, defined as ≥450 mg/day, was determined from average intake reported on the three QFFQs. Maternal whole blood samples were genotyped for the PEMT SNP rs12325817, using real-time PCR performed on an Eppendorf Realplex 4.0 (Eppendorf North America, Westbury, NY, USA).<SEP>Sample Attrition<SEP>A flow diagram of the progression of participants through the trial is presented in Figure 1. 70 women were randomly assigned to condition, but 1 withdrew from the study prior to initiating treatment. Of the 69 in the trial, there were 4 non-study-related fetal deaths (1 spontaneous abortion, 2 stillbirths, 1 fetus whose mother was murdered during pregnancy); 2 women who met a priori exclusionary criteria were removed from the sample (1 twin pregnancy diagnosed after randomization, 1 very preterm delivery (<29 wk gestation)); and 1 woman withdrew after delivery but prior to the 6.5-month infant assessments. In this paper we present data on the 62 infants (31 choline, 31 placebo) who were assessed during the trial.<SEP>Infant Assessments<SEP>EBC<SEP>EBC was assessed at 6.5 months (with correction for GA in cases of preterm birth (GA<37 weeks)), using the procedure developed by and, in which the infant is entertained by a research assistant using a visual display of brightly colored moving objects and toys while being administered the EBC trials. We used the same commercially available human EBC system (San Diego Instruments, Model #2325-0145-W) from our two previous studies with older children. The infant wore a headband which supported a flexible plastic tube that delivered an air puff to the right eye, at a distance of ~2.5 cm (Fig. 2). Eyelid closure was measured with a photodiode placed at the corner of the right eye. Above the head, ~45 cm to either side, two 7 Ohm speakers delivered a 1-kHz, 80-dB tone. The interface units generated the auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) and air puff unconditioned stimulus (US), processed the eyeblink signal, and integrated the peripheral devices with the personal computer.<SEP>Each session consisted of 51 trials of the delay EBC procedure, in which the air puff was administered simultaneously during the last 100ms of a 750ms presentation of the tone (Fig. 3). The intertrial interval ranged from 8–16s, with an average of 1 trial every 12s. Every fifth trial in each block of 10 was an air puff-alone trial to test for somatosensory responsiveness. Every 10th trial was a tone-alone trial to test for conditioned responding in the absence of the subsequent air puff. In this paradigm the infant must learn to adjust the timing of the anticipatory blink, which occurred optimally between 300 and 650ms after the onset of the tone. Eyeblinks within 350ms prior to the air puff onset were considered CRs. Responses that occurred in the first 200ms after the tone onset were coded as alpha or startle responses (see). EBC sessions were administered on 3 days. Time between visits did not differ between groups: choline (M=4.0 days between visits) vs. placebo (M=4.5), t=1.22, p=0.226.<SEP>Preprocessing of the data was similar to our previous reports with children with modifications to address movement and other signal-to-noise integrity artifacts that arise when studying EBC in infants. Sessions in which at least 22 trials provided usable data were considered acceptable. Of the 62 infants assessed at 6.5 months, 11 were excluded (6 choline, 5 placebo) due to excessive movement (noisy data) and/or problems with sensor placement (e.g., sensor became misaligned during the session so that the air puff and photodiode sensor were no longer properly aligned with the eye). An infant met criterion for conditioning if s/he exhibited CRs in at least 50% of the trials administered during at least one of the three sessions. Data were excluded from an additional three infants who failed to meet this criterion in the first two sessions and did not provide usable data for the third session (i.e., did not have the opportunity to demonstrate whether they would have conditioned during the final session). There was no difference between the number of infants excluded from the EBC analyses in the two treatment arms, χ2(1) = 1.48, p = 0.224.<SEP>Infant growth<SEP>Birth weight, length, and head circumference were obtained from medical records. GA was based on early gestation ultrasound, which was available for 85.7% of the participants, or date of last menstrual period. Infant weight, length, and head circumference were measured at 6.5 and 12 months by research staff trained by RCC using standard WHO protocols; weight, length, and head circumference z-scores and percentiles were calculated using WHO norms, which adjust for age and sex.<SEP>Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence (FTII)<SEP>Visual recognition memory was assessed at 6.5 and 12 months on the FTII. The infant, seated on the mother’s lap, is first shown two identical photographs and then a novel photograph paired with the familiar one. The normative response, preference for the novel stimulus, indicates ability to recall the familiar stimulus and discriminate it from the novel one. Infant fixation was recorded on a computer, and novelty preference was computed by dividing duration of time looking at the novel stimulus by total time looking at the paired familiar and novel stimuli for each of the 10 problems. Mean length of look, a measure of information processing speed, was computed for each problem by dividing the total duration looking time by the number of looks. A pattern of short looks is believed to reflect more rapid and efficient processing of information. Usable FTII data were available for 53 infants (85.5%) at 6.5 months and 52 (83.9%) at 12 months (e.g., fussiness, inattention).<SEP>FASD diagnosis<SEP>In 2016 and 2017 we organized diagnostic clinics, in which the infants were examined for growth and anomalies independently by HEH and one of four other experienced dysmorphologists, using the revised Institute of Medicine guidelines. All 69 mothers had confirmed heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Infants with at least 2 of the 3 principal dysmorphic features (flat philtrum and thin vermilion [4 or 5 on the) lip-philtrum guide] and short palpebral fissures (<10th percentile); microcephaly (<10th percentile); and weight or length restriction (<10th percentile) were diagnosed with FAS. A diagnosis of PFAS required presence of 2 of the 3 facial anomalies and microcephaly or weight or length restriction. The other infants were classified as heavily exposed nonsyndromal (HE). The dysmorphologists, SWJ, RCC, CDM, and JLJ met daily in case conferences following the clinic to reach consensus regarding which infants met criteria for FAS or PFAS diagnoses.<SEP>Data Analysis<SEP>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (v.22; IBM, Armonk, NY). Demographic background and exposure for the 62 infants whose data are reported in this paper were compared using t-tests and χ2 analysis. χ2 was used to compare the number of infants who met criterion for conditioning in the choline and placebo arms, and mixed model repeated measures regression was used to compare changes in percent CRs across the three EBC sessions in the two groups. Pearson correlation was used to examine the relation of protocol adherence to percent CRs in Session 3 for the choline and placebo arms separately. T-tests were used to compare anthropometric measures between treatment arms during the newborn period; analysis of covariance, to compare treatment arms on the 6.5- and 12-month measures after adjustment for their corresponding anthropometric measures at birth. Mixed model repeated measures regression was used to compare growth trajectory percentiles between groups from birth through 12 months. T-tests were used to compare treatment arms on the FTII measures. χ2 was used to compare incidence of FAS or PFAS in the two groups. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; choline vs. placebo X adequate vs. inadequate choline intake during pregnancy) was used to test the hypothesis that the effects of the choline treatment would be stronger in infants born to mothers with inadequate choline intake during pregnancy. Two-way ANOVA (choline vs. placebo X presence vs. absence of the maternal PEMT polymorphism rs12325817) was used to test the hypothesis that treatment effects would be stronger in infants born to mothers with the polymorphism.","Results<SEP>Sample Characteristics<SEP>The treatment and placebo arms did not differ in social class or maternal education, verbal and nonverbal intellectual competence, perceived stress, depression, or nutritional status (Table 1). About 30% of both groups were poorly nourished based on their dietary caloric intake, and more than 70% did not meet the AI for dietary choline intake. There were no group differences in alcohol consumption, which was very heavy for both groups at time of conception (≈10.0 standard drinks/occasion on an average of 2–3 days/week). Women in both arms continued to drink heavily across pregnancy (≈8–9 drinks/occasion) but reduced their frequency to about 1–2 days/week. Both groups smoked about ¼ pack/day on average, and cigarettes/day was only slightly higher among those in the choline group. Use of illicit drugs other than marijuana was rare; none of the women reported using cocaine, heroin, or methaqualone. Although women who used methamphetamine were excluded at time of recruitment, 4 reported using it later in pregnancy (2 choline, 2 placebo). There were no group differences in weeks gestation at time of booking, initial screening, or randomization or duration of choline supplementation. Weeks gestation at randomization ranged from 8.6–26.0 (Median=20.0); duration of choline supplementation ranged from 9–27 weeks (Median=18.6). The groups differed on sex of infant, with more girls in the choline and more boys in the placebo arm. There were no group differences in infant age at the 6.5- and 12-month assessments.<SEP>Eyeblink Conditioning<SEP>Among the 48 infants with usable EBC data, a larger proportion of the choline group met criterion for conditioning compared with the placebo group, although the effect fell short of conventional levels of statistical significance (Table 2). When the four infants whose mothers’ adherence was very poor (<20%) were excluded from the analysis, the effect was significant despite the smaller sample size; two-thirds of choline-treated infants met criterion for conditioning, compared with only one-third of the placebo group. When percent CRs in the two arms was examined across the three sessions, there was a main effect for session, F(2,60)=32.66, p<0.001, but not for treatment, F(1,30)=0.19, p>0.20 (Fig. 4). The infants in the choline arm showed a significantly greater increase in percent CRs across the three sessions than the placebo group (group by session interaction, F(2,60)=4.85, p<0.01.<SEP>The relation between protocol adherence and percent CRs in Session 3 for the choline treatment group is shown in Figure 5. An analysis of Mahalanobis distance identified one bivariate maternal outlier (p<0.007) with very poor adherence and high percent CRs. When that outlier was removed from the analysis, there was a clear linear relation between degree of adherence and conditioning by Session 3, r=0.63, p<0.01. By contrast, adherence was not related to percent CRs in the placebo group, r=−0.14, p>0.20.<SEP>Gestational Age and Somatic Growth<SEP>The majority of the women (93.7%) had full-term pregnancies, and GA did not differ between groups (Table 3). Although low birthweight (<2500 g) was common (26.1%), the incidence (choline 25.0%, placebo 32.3%) was similar between arms, χ2(1)=0.41, p=0.524. There were also no significant group differences in birth size. With the exception of length in the placebo group, birth percentile measures were markedly below the 50th percentile, likely due to the high levels of alcohol to which this cohort was exposed.<SEP>Among infants in the placebo arm, z-scores and percentiles for weight, length, and head circumference decreased from birth to 6.5 months (Table 3), which is consistent with our previous studies in Detroit and Cape Town that found worsening of fetal alcohol growth restriction in the 1st year of life. By contrast, infants in the choline arm demonstrated considerable catch-up growth in weight and head circumference by 6.5 months, which continued to be evident at 12 months. In repeated measures analyses examining the percentiles, the choline group showed significantly greater increases across this age period than the placebo group in weight, F(2,116)=4.85, p=0.009, and head circumference, F(2,116)=5.40, p=0.006. Group differences were not significant for the raw weight (kg), length (cm), and head circumference (cm) measures, presumably because the choline arm contained a higher proportion of females, who tend to be smaller than males.<SEP>Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence<SEP>Infants in the choline treatment arm performed more optimally on the FTII than placebo infants at 12 months, with higher novelty preference scores, indicating better visual recognition memory function (Table 4). The Cohen’s d measure indicates a moderate-to-large effect size. The moderate effect size for the processing speed measure suggests that this effect might be significant in a larger sample.<SEP>FASD Diagnosis<SEP>Within the choline arm, 8 infants met criteria for FAS and 2 for PFAS (32.3%), compared with 5 who met criteria for FAS and 2 for PFAS (22.6%) in the placebo arm, χ2(1)=0.73, p=0.393.<SEP>Impact of Maternal Dietary Choline Status<SEP>Only 9.7% (3 choline-treated, 3 placebo) of the 62 infants assessed in this study were born to mothers whose dietary choline intake during pregnancy was adequate (>450 mg/day), and none exceeded the UL of 3.5 g/day. 21.6% of the infants (6 choline-treated, 5 placebo) were born to mothers who carry the rs12325817 variant of the enzyme PEMT, which reduces endogenous choline synthesis. The six outcomes on which the choline and placebo groups differed were examined. None of the choline group by maternal PEMT allele interactions were significant (all ps>0.20).","DISCUSSION<SEP>The aim of this trial was to assess the efficacy of a high dose choline supplementation initiated early in pregnancy in mitigating effects of heavy PAE on EBC and other infant developmental outcomes known to be affected by alcohol exposure. Infants born to choline-treated mothers were more likely to meet criterion for EBC conditioning and showed greater increases in CRs across the three training sessions, compared with infants whose mothers received placebo. Moreover, within the choline arm, degree of maternal adherence to the supplementation protocol was a strong predictor of infant EBC performance. We selected EBC as our primary outcome based on evidence that it is a highly sensitive indicator of fetal alcohol impairment in humans, it is impaired in laboratory animals with PAE, and ethanol-induced EBC impairment can be mitigated by choline supplementation in the animal model. Given that by 5 months of age, human infants reach the same terminal levels of conditioning as adults, EBC provides an excellent early biobehavioral marker of a PAE-related deficit that can be used for evaluating the efficacy of a micronutrient intervention in pregnancy.<SEP>Pre- and/or postnatal growth restriction was identified clinically as a critical feature of FAS when the syndrome was first described and is a key element in the diagnosis of FAS and PFAS. The finding that choline treatment mitigated postnatal but not fetal growth restriction is consistent with evidence that the effects on growth restriction during these two developmental periods are mediated by different mechanisms. We have previously shown that growth trajectory pattern predicts severity of fetal alcohol-related cognitive impairment. Correlations between PAE and cognitive function in childhood were significantly stronger in infants with both pre- and postnatal growth restriction than in infants demonstrating postnatal catch-up growth. Our finding that choline treatment mitigated adverse effects of PAE on postnatal growth thus provides some evidence from infancy that choline supplementation may have potential to protect against a range of alcohol-related cognitive deficits that do not become evident until childhood, although beneficial effects in childhood will need to be confirmed in follow-up studies.<SEP>On the FTII, infants in the choline arm exhibited better visual recognition memory than those in the placebo group, as indicated by preferential looking at the novel stimulus. A larger sample would be needed to evaluate the effects on processing speed. By contrast to classical tests of infant development, such as the Bayley Scales, FTII performance has been repeatedly shown to predict intellectual function in childhood. Whereas Bayley assessments rely heavily on sensorimotor manipulation of objects through 12 months, the FTII assesses basic information-processing skills involving encoding and retrieval. The predictive validity of the FTII is consistent with the assumption that the neural integrity and elementary cognitive processing ability necessary for later more complex cognitive function are already present in infancy and that the processes by which infants distribute their attention during visual processing of novel and familiar processes are essentially the same as those used by older children and adults.<SEP>Choline supplementation did not alter the incidence of FAS or PFAS. Mouse model studies have demonstrated that the dysmorphic craniofacial features required for these diagnoses are formed during the early embryonic period. We did not predict that this treatment would protect against emergence of these anomalies, since the intervention was not initiated until the 2nd trimester for all but three study participants, who were randomized at the end of the 1st trimester.<SEP>Despite numerous studies showing positive effects in rodents, no clear evidence of beneficial effects of choline supplementation was seen in three previous human trials, two of which assessed postnatal supplementation in childhood. In a pediatric study, administered 500mg/day choline (2–2.5 times AI) or placebo to 60 children (2.5–5 yr) for 9 months. Protocol adherence was confirmed by the finding that higher serum choline and betaine concentrations were found in the choline supplemented group. Positive effects were not seen on the primary outcome, the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Elicited imitation was assessed as a secondary outcome. There was no effect of choline on immediate imitation, which assesses initial memory encoding, and an effect on delayed imitation that was seen only in the younger group (2.5–4.0 yr) may have been due to a marginal baseline difference between the groups and/or a ceiling effect. In another pediatric study, administered 625 mg/day (1.7–2.5 times AI) to 55 children (ages 5–10 yr) with FASD for 6 weeks. No effects were seen on memory, executive function, attention, or hyperactivity in relation to mean dietary choline intake despite good adherence to the treatment protocol.<SEP>In a study of 367 infants in the Ukraine conducted by Chambers and colleagues, two groups (alcohol-consuming women; abstainers and women who drank minimally) were randomly assigned to receive a choline supplement (750 mg/day (1.7 times AI)) or placebo during pregnancy. No beneficial effect of the choline supplement was seen on newborn growth, after adjustment for smoking, or on BSID-II cognitive or psychomotor performance at 6 months. However, adherence estimates were uncertain since they were based on maternal report, and significant increases were not seen in the serum choline levels of the mothers in the choline-treated group during the course of the intervention. Data on cardiac orienting responses (ΔHR) were collected on a subset of these infants during auditory and visual habituation/dishabituation learning paradigms administered at 12 months. No choline effects were seen on the auditory task. On the visual task, which examines aspects of cognitive function similar to those assessed in the FTII, choline supplementation resulted in greater ΔHR (amplitude and latency) during habituation for all infants (i.e., when the alcohol-exposed and control infants were pooled) and on amplitude only for the infants with no PAE during dishabituation.<SEP>Several features of our intervention distinguish our protocol from those used in the previous human studies. First, the choline dose was higher (2g/day)—4.4 times AI—albeit well below the tolerable UL for choline specified by the Food and Nutrition Board. The efficacy of this high dose is consistent with the beneficial effects reported for the high doses used in the animal studies. For example, administered 100mg/kg bodyweight, which would be the equivalent of 6g/day in a 60-kg woman. Although it is difficult to compare between-species differences in dose, in one study the human effective dose in the brain was found to be underestimated by 36% using rat data. If the 2g/day dose in our study were increased by 36%, the effective dose would be 2.7, still considerably below the dose used in the Thomas et al. rodent studies. Second, the treatment was initiated much earlier in development than in the pediatric studies and possibly earlier than in the Ukraine study. Our data are thus consistent with findings from laboratory animal studies suggesting that choline supplementation may be more effective when administered earlier in development. Another strength of this trial was the use of culture-free assessments (EBC, Fagan, anthropometry) that permit generalizability to other populations.<SEP>Several studies of effects of ethanol with laboratory animals have demonstrated beneficial effects of choline supplementation on working memory and learning, and conditioning. Although these effects were initially attributed to increased release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus, the amount of choline that accumulates in the fetal brain following maternal supplementation does not appear to be sufficient to enhance acetylcholine release. Zeisel and colleagues have suggested two alternative mechanisms: (1) Choline is a potent source of biologically labile methyl-donor groups, which play an important role in DNA methylation, a critical mechanism in epigenetic processes leading to altered gene expression. Through changes in gene expression, choline may enhance a range of embryological and fetal developmental processes, including neuronal precursor cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Gestational choline supplementation has been shown to prevent PAE-modulation of histone and DNA methylation in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons and to reduce hyper-methylation associated with PAE in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. (2) Choline’s role as a precursor to two cell membrane constituents (phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin) and to cell signaling factors (platelet activating factor, sphingosylphosphocholine) has also been suggested as a mechanism contributing to its neuroprotective properties.<SEP>In their laboratory animal study on effects of postnatal choline supplementation on EBC, examined two groups of rats during adulthood—one group trained on delay EBC, the procedure used with the infants in our study; the other, on trace EBC. In delay, the CS precedes, overlaps, and co-terminates with the onset of the US, whereas in trace, there is a brief stimulus-free “trace interval” between the offset of the CS and the onset of the US. In our study, we administered delay conditioning because, although learning rates are slower, typically-developing infants demonstrate patterns of acquisition for delay that are indistinguishable from adults in terms of asymptote and timing of response, whereas trace conditioning during infancy is at best rudimentary. Thomas and Tran found that, although performance of adult rats exposed to ethanol early in development was significantly impaired on both tasks, choline supplementation mitigated the effect on trace but not delay conditioning. They suggested that the selective deficits in trace conditioning that they observed were likely related to hippocampal dysfunction and that choline did not attenuate effects on delay because it is more dependent on the functional integrity of the cerebellum and less on the hippocampus. However, although animals can perform delay EBC even after the hippocampus has been removed, an intact hippocampus has been found to modulate delay conditioning in both animals and humans (e.g.,). The hippocampus may actually be more involved in delay conditioning during early development, as hippocampal injury has been shown to impair delay conditioning in weanling and juvenile rats. Thomas and Tran’s failure to find the beneficial effect of choline on delay conditioning seen in our study may be related to differences in the period of exposure to alcohol or choline, in the age when EBC assessments were performed, or a difference between rodent models and humans.<SEP>In the U.S., choline supplementation is not part of standard prenatal care and dietary choline intake in pregnancy is often inadequate at rates similar to those seen in Cape Town, which can increase the risk of delivering an infant with a birth defect (see). PAE can further disturb the metabolism of choline and other methyl donors, thereby potentially exacerbating dietary inadequacy. The American Medical Association has recently issued a policy recommendation for inclusion of choline in prenatal supplements (https://wire.ama-assn.org/ama-news/ama-backs-global-health-experts-calling-infertility-disease).<SEP> has suggested that choline supplementation is likely to be most effective in pregnant women with choline deficiency, based on findings in the animal model. Choline deficiency can be caused by either inadequate dietary choline intake and/or the presence of the rs12325817 variant of the enzyme PEMT, which reduces endogenous choline synthesis. We found a lower incidence of this polymorphism in the Cape Coloured population compared with the prevalence reported in a Chapel Hill, NC, sample. Given the small number of women with adequate choline intake and/or the PEMT variant, our sample lacked power to determine whether choline supplementation is differentially effective in these women. It should be noted that the high prevalence of inadequate choline intake in this population (>88%) and in this sample (>70%) may have enhanced the efficacy of the choline supplementation, although, as noted, dietary choline deficiency is also found in 93% of U.S. women (NHANES survey,; also see).<SEP>Limitations<SEP>One limitation of this study was small sample size; the findings need to be confirmed in a larger trial. In addition to the large effect sizes on EBC, postnatal growth, and 12-month recognition memory, the moderate effect size on processing speed suggests another effect that warrants examination in a larger sample. Although there is a greater likelihood of subject loss in infant studies, due to movement artifact, fussiness, etc., compared to older children, our subject loss was somewhat lower than in other comparable studies (e.g.,). A multi-site trial will be needed to assess generalizability to other populations, including those from differing ethnic backgrounds and populations that do not have the high incidence of poor nutrition found in this sample. Whether the choline supplementation prevents or repairs fetal alcohol-related impairment to brain structure and function is not clear and needs to be examined using animal models and in human neuroimaging studies. It is also not clear whether choline supplementation specifically targets alcohol-related impairment or improves development in all infants. A human study in which both alcohol-consuming and abstaining mothers are randomly assigned to receive choline at high doses or placebo early in pregnancy is needed to address this question.<SEP>Conclusions<SEP>This exploratory study is the first to provide evidence that a high dose of choline administered early in pregnancy can mitigate adverse effects of heavy PAE on EBC, postnatal growth, and cognition in human infants. These findings are consistent with studies of ethanol-exposed animals that have demonstrated beneficial effects of choline supplementation on classical conditioning, learning, and memory. Given that psychosocial interventions are often ineffective with heavy drinking pregnant women, the evidence that early choline supplementation can mitigate alcohol effects on the developing fetus provides an important breakthrough in treatment of maternal drinking during pregnancy, which is often intractable to intervention. This supplementation program was effective even among highly disadvantaged, poorly educated heavy drinking women. These findings have important public health implications since FASD continue to be a leading cause of intellectual disabilities, and infant outcomes showing positive effects in this trial are predictive of cognitive function in childhood. Follow-up of this cohort will be important to determine whether the positive effects of choline supplementation persist into childhood.<SEP>The authors declare no competing financial interests.",40635,"['OBWCCE', 'VITMIN', 'EATBTS']"
24594703,"Introduction<SEP>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common diseases; it has a high incidence, numerous complications, high disability rate, low awareness rate, and heavy economic burden. Many countries pay heavy costs for T2DM every year. Although the genetic heterogeneity of T2DM is associated with genetic and environmental factors, genetic polymorphism and susceptibility to T2DM remain largely unknown. About 20 genes and 60 genetic loci have been linked to T2DM susceptibility. A recent study indicated that the T2DM susceptibility of Chinese Han populations, including East Asian populations, is significantly higher than those of Western populations. This increased T2DM susceptibility has been associated with G-protein–coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) rs10886471, which is endemic to East Asian populations. The cis-expression quantitative loci (cis-eQTL) analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that the rs10886471 SNP allele changes the transcription level of the GRK5 gene, but the mechanism remains unclear. Non-coding microsatellite polymorphism could act as a functional unit and interact with promoter SNPs during transcription regulation. The rs10886471 is located in the intron region of GRK5. However, whether the effect on the gene expression of rs10886471 intronic SNP depends on the intronic (CA)n splicing regulator should be studied. We first report an intronic (CA)n repeat polymorphism in GRK5 rs10886471 and susceptibility to T2DM.","Methods<SEP>Subjects<SEP>The inclusion criterion for subjects was age ranging from 35 years to 85 years old. The exclusion criteria were as follows: type 1 diabetes, recent acute disease, chronic inflammatory disease, infectious disease, and metabolic disease other than prediabetes and diabetes. Prediabetes and diabetes were diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria. The adult community residents (n = 1164, 584 men and 580 women) were recruited from Haikou City on Hainan Island from March 2011 to September 2011 using a multistage stratified cluster sampling design. The following clinical characteristics and information were recorded for each subject: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour plasma glucose(2 h PG) in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The subjects were assigned into four groups based on blood glucose level: normal fasting glucose (NFG) group (n = 282), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) group (n = 287), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) group (n = 293), and T2DM group (n = 302). The age composition did not differ by more than 5 years, and the gender composition ratio did not differ by more than 5%. Physical examination and blood biochemical testing were conducted for all subjects. GRK5 rs10886471 (CA)n polymorphism experiments were also performed from October 2011 to March 2013 as follow-up tests. Our study was considered and approved by Hainan medical ehtics committee on January 2011. Our study began after all participants provided written informed consent.<SEP>Microsatellite polymorphisms detection<SEP>Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood using a BloodGen Mini kit (CWBiotech, Beijing, China). Microsatellite polymorphism was identified via PCR and sequencing. The primers were designed to amplify the 320 bp region of GRK5 rs10886471. Information on the rs10886471 sequence is available online (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=10886471#fasta). The forward primer was 5′-aagttcttccctgctagagaa-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-ctctttttgttctaagtgaaaac-3′. PCR was performed under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; followed by 33 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 53°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. The reaction was performed at a final volume of 50 µl, which contained the basic reaction components. The PCR products were verified via 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using a Quick Gel Extraction Kit (CWBiotech, Beijing, China). The purified PCR products were directly sequenced or ligated into a pGEM-T Easy Vector sequence (Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd, China). The sequencing results were aligned with the intron region of the GRK5 gene from GenBank (NM_005308.2) and were analyzed using the BioEdit software. Standard procedures and the latest scientific test specifications were strictly followed. Two people independently counted the alleles and discrepancies between the two examiners were resolved through repeat examinations of the samples.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>The microsatellite polymorphism was analyzed using the SSRHunter genetic profiler software. The (CA)n allelic frequencies were estimated through direct gene counting. Polymorphism information content (PIC) was calculated using the PIC-Calc0.6 software. A Pearson's chi-square test was used to count the variables and an ANOVA was used for mean comparisons. Forward stepwise regression was used for multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the strength of the associations of GRK5 polymorphism with prediabetes and with T2DM. SPSS v17.0 was used for all statistical analysis. Differences with p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant, and all p values are two tailed.","Results<SEP>General data<SEP>  Table 1  summarizes the clinical characteristics and biochemical results of the subjects. The four groups did not significantly differ in terms of age and gender (P>0.05). However, waist circumference, BMI, SBP, DBP, FPG, and 2 h PG increased with the abnormal increase in blood glucose (IFG and IGT groups) and continued to increase with the blood sugar until it reached T2DM levels. The clinical parameters significantly differed between the four groups (all P<0.05).<SEP>(CA)n polymorphism in rs10886471<SEP>CA repeat sequences are abundant in the human genome. Numerous studies have revealed that intronic (CA)n repeats could play a novel and generally important role in the splicing of enhancers or repressors during gene expression. Therefore, we extended the rs10886471 SNP analysis to study the short tandem repeat (STR) function. Genomic DNA from 1164 subjects was amplified via PCR and sequenced using primers specific for the rs10886471 studied region (about 320 bp) as shown in  Figure 1  and  2 ).<SEP>(CA)n allelic frequencies of rs10886471<SEP>The allelic frequencies are listed in  Figure 3  and  Table 2 , (CA)17 had the highest allelic frequency in each group, followed (CA)16. However, the allelic frequencies of (CA)16 and (CA)17 were lower in the NFG group than in the IFG, IGT, and T2DM groups. The allelic frequencies of (CA)15, (CA)18, and (CA)19 in the NFG group were higher than those in the IFG, IGT, and T2DM groups. The allelic frequency of (CA)16 was significantly lower than that of (CA)17, but significantly higher than those of (CA)18 and (CA)19 among the four groups (χ2 = 16.190, P = 0.001; χ2 = 10.221, P = 0.017; and χ2 = 8.265, P = 0.041, respectively). The allelic frequency distributions of (CA)15, (CA)17, (CA)18, and (CA)19 did not significant differ among the four groups [(CA)15 (χ2 = 0.570, P = 0.903); (CA)17 (χ2 = 6.096, P = 0.107); (CA)18 (χ2 = 1.368, P = 0.713); (CA)19 (χ2 = 3.889, P = 0.274), respectively]. By contrast, the frequency of (CA)16 increased with the abnormally increasing blood glucose (IFG and IGT groups) and continued to increase with blood sugar until it reached T2DM levels. The allelic frequencies of (CA)16 in the IFG, IGT, and T2DM groups were much higher than in the NFG group (χ2 = 12.300, P = 0.000; χ2 = 13.672, P = 0.000; χ2 = 14.476, P = 0.000, respectively).<SEP>The PIC values of the rs10886471 (CA)n alleles<SEP>The PIC values of the rs10886471 (CA)n alleles in the NFG, IFG, IGT, and T2DM groups were 0.6146, 0.6233, 0.6291, and 0.6327, respectively. The PICs of the four groups all exceeded 0.5, which indicates that the GRK5 (CA)n repeats exhibited genetic polymorphism. The PIC of each group did not significantly deviate from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.<SEP>Association of GRK5 (CA)n polymorphisms with prediabetes and T2DM<SEP>Logistic regression analysis was conducted on the alleles and the results are presented in  Table 2 . The NFG group was designated as the control group, whereas the three remaining groups were designated as the case groups and classified as dependent variables (NFG = 0, IFG = 1, IGT = 2, and T2DM = 3). Each allele was classified as an independent variable. The statistical significance of the inclusion criteria was set to P>0.05, whereas that for the exclusion criteria was set to P<0.10.  Table 2  shows the association of intronic (CA)n repeat polymorphisms with prediabetes and T2DM risk. Using the most common (CA)17 allele as a reference for estimating the strength of the association, allele (CA)16 was significantly associated with increased risk of prediabetes and T2DM [IFG, OR (95% CI) = 1.938 (1.289–2.915), P = 0.001; IGT, OR (95% CI) = 2.021(1.347–3.034), P = 0.001; T2DM, OR (95% CI)  = 2.012 (1.345–3.009), P = 0.001, respectively]. The other alleles were not significantly associated with abnormal blood glucose (P>0.05). The NFG group was designated as the control group, whereas the other three groups were designated as the case groups. All alleles without (CA)16 that included (CA)15, (CA)17, (CA)18, and (CA)19 were classified as one multiple allele. The (CA)16 allele was used as a reference. The multiple alleles were negatively correlated significantly with the IFG, IGT, and T2DM groups [IFG, OR (95% CI)  = 0.510 (0.347–0.750), P = 0.001; IGT, OR (95% CI)  = 0.492 (0.336–0.721), P = 0.001; T2DM, OR (95% CI)  = 0.484 (0.331–0.708), P = 0.000, respectively].","Discussion<SEP>  Table 1  shows that the biochemical indices increased with the abnormal increase in blood glucose from IFG and IGT levels to T2DM levels. The interaction between the indices and the genetic polymorphism requires further research. SNPs and STRs are presently the two main genetic markers. The SNPSTR, which is a STR with one or more tightly linked SNPs, is a relatively new type of marker. A previous study reported that the rs10886471 SNP is a risk marker T2DM. The mRNA levels of the GRK5 gene in the peripheral blood of the T2DM group was significantly higher than that in the controlled group, which suggests that the allelic frequency of the rs10886471 SNP affects the GRK5 gene transcription level. However, how the rs10886471 intronic SNP affects transcription remains uncertain. Intronic SNPs may play a role by directly affecting gene expression or through linkage disequilibrium (LD) with another SNP.<SEP>Our study shows that rs10886471 is an SNP with a tightly linked STR marker. The increasing frequency of rs10886471 STR (CA)16 is consistent with the increase in blood glucose. The frequency of the (CA)16 allele was significantly lower than that of the (CA)17 allele, but higher than that of alleles (CA)18 and (CA)19 among the four groups (all P<0.05). The logistic regression models also showed that the (CA)16 allele is the only risk factor significantly associated with abnormal blood glucose (OR>1, P<0.05). The multiple alleles without any (CA)16 were significantly correlated negatively with prediabetes and T2DM (0<OR<1, P<0.05). Therefore, the (CA)16 allele of rs10886471 may contribute to the risk of developing T2DM, but multiple alleles without any (CA)16 may be protective. Consequently, the (CA)n polymorphism of GRk5 rs10886471 has a risk-protective yin–yang effect against prediabetes and T2DM. Our STR study combined with previously reports on rs10886471 SNP shows that the mechanism by which rs10886471 intronic SNP influences gene expression may differ from direct effect or LD with another SNP.<SEP>The most common cause of STR (CA)n repeats is replication slippage, which is caused by mismatches between DNA strands. Numerous associations of variants with phenotypes cannot be elucidated using exonic variants; this limitation highlights the need for intronic variants. Changes in length of STR (CA)n repeats within cis-regulatory regions can also change gene expression. As previously reported, microsatellites are predictors of nucleotide diversity and divergence, and (TG/CA)n repeats are present in the regulation of transcription from disease-related genes such as epidermal growth factor receptor, hydroxysteroid (11-beta) dehydrogenase 2, interferon-gamma, and CD154 . These mounting findings suggest that rs10886471 intronic SNP that causes GRK5 overexpression and the subsequent risk of T2DM may be due to the involvement of intronic STR (CA)n in splicing ( Figure 4 ).<SEP> GRK5 affects insulin signal transduction pathways. The (CA)16 of rs10886471 changes the GRK5 gene transcription level via splicing code. GRK5 phosphorylates G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are signal transduction receptors involved in glucose metabolism. After phosphorylation by GRK5, GPCRs negatively regulate the effects of the glucose metabolic signal, and causes abnormal blood glucose and diabetes. Previous studies have reported that GRK5 and GPCR (class A) are related to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Current studies have shown that GPCRs (class B) are promising therapeutic targets that may aid in the design of new small-molecule drugs for metabolism diseases. However, the signal transduction pathway of GRK5–GPCR (class B) in T2DM remains unknown. The intronic (CA)n splicing regulator in GRK5 expression provides new insight into the transduction mechanism of T2DM.<SEP>In summary, GRK5 rs10886471 acts as both an SNP site and an STR site, i.e., an SNPSTR marker. The rs10886471 STR has five (CA)n alleles and exerts a yin–yang effect on T2DM.The yin–yang effect may be dependent on the number of STR (CA)n repeats. The rs10886471 intronic SNP that causes GRK5 overexpression and the subsequent risk of T2DM may caused by the rs10886471 intronic STR (CA)n splicing enhancer. Further studies should focus on a comprehensive association analysis between the GRK5 rs10886471 SNP and STR with a large sample size. In addition, the mechanism by which the intronic (CA)n splicing code regulates the signal transduction of GRK5–GPCR (class B) should be elucidated.",14347,['OBWCCE']
21765007,"Introduction<SEP>The current evidence from in vitro and animal studies strongly supports a protective effect of selenium on colorectal cancer, while the evidence from clinical trials and observational studies is inconclusive. Secondary analyses of two clinical trials provide conflicting findings. An early trial for the prevention of the recurrence of non-melanoma skin cancer [Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial (NPCT)] found a statistically significant 61% lower risk of colorectal cancer [95% confidence intervals (CI) = 10 to 83%, p = 0.03] in the selenium supplementation group. In contrast, a recent large clinical trial for prostate cancer prevention [Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT)] found no effect of selenium on colorectal cancer, a pre-specified secondary outcome [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05, 99% CI = 0.66-1.67]. Many observational studies, but not all, support a protective effect of selenium on risk of colorectal tumors. Most studies or trials were smaller or restricted to men and, hence, did not provide stratified results by gender. Within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, we reported that serum selenium was inversely associated with colorectal adenoma risk only in men, but not in women. Effect modification by gender may be plausible given gender differences in selenium metabolism.<SEP>Selenium is hypothesized to reduce cancer risk due to its antioxidant activity, which is mediated through selenoenzymes. Selenoenzymes are encoded by a small number of genes (25 in humans) that often contain selenium as selenocysteine at their active center. Genetic variants in selenoenzymes may affect their activity and thus directly or indirectly affect the risk of cancer.<SEP>This study investigated whether serum selenium concentrations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five selenoenzymes expressed in the colorectal tissue [glutathione peroxidase 1-4 (GPX1-4) and selenoprotein P (SEPP1)] were associated with colorectal cancer risk. Data were from a large case-control study nested within the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study, which recruited postmenopausal women from 40 clinical centers throughout the United States. We also performed a meta-analysis to summarize the current evidence on selenium and the risk of colorectal tumors.","Methods<SEP>WHI Observational Study<SEP>Study population<SEP>The WHI Observational Study includes 93,676 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age at the time of recruitment. These women were recruited mostly through age-targeted mass mailing and media announcements in areas surrounding the 40 WHI clinical centers across the United States and described in more detail elsewhere. Colorectal cancer cases were identified through annual questionnaires or interviews and were adjudicated through local and central reviews of the medical records and pathology reports. When cases and controls were selected for this study (Fall 2005), only 4.7% of the initial WHI participants were lost to or had stopped follow-up. As of August 2005, the agreement rate between local and WHI Clinical Coordinating Center adjudications for colorectal cancer was 96%. In the nested case-control study, cases were diagnosed with colorectal cancer between October 1993 to September 2005 (n=805). Central adjudication determined later that one case was not a colorectal cancer case, resulting in 804 cases for analysis. Controls were selected from all eligible women in the WHI Observational Study who were alive and had not been diagnosed with colorectal cancer at the time of the case’s diagnosis. They were individually matched to cases by age (± 3 years), enrollment date to the study (± 168 days), race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, or other), and hysterectomy (yes or no) (n=805).<SEP>Data collection<SEP>Participants in the WHI Observational Study had clinic visits at baseline and year 3. Self-administered questionnaires were completed at baseline and annually thereafter. The baseline questionnaire acquired detailed information on demographic and lifestyle characteristics, medical history, reproductive history and hormone regimen. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline using a 122-item food frequency questionnaire. During the clinic visits at baseline and year 3, interviewers collected data on use of dietary supplements and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Overnight fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and year 3 and maintained at 4°C until serum was separated from cells and stored at -70°C within 2 hours after blood draw.<SEP>Laboratory methods<SEP>Serum selenium concentration was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, Fremont CA) according to the standard protocol. Each sample was run in duplicate and considered acceptable if the coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 10%. Internal quality control (QC) samples were run before and after each batch to ensure the quality of the assay and the mean CV of these samples was 7.3%. In addition, blinded duplicates from 96 women who were recruited, but not enrolled in WHI, were included in batches with study samples. Three batches had CVs >21%. All three batches were originally run on two dates. When we re-analyzed all the batches that were originally run on these two dates (three batches with CVs >21% and another with CV <10%), all yielded acceptable CVs. After these reruns, the mean CV for the blinded QCs was 5.8%. The Spearman correlation between blood samples collected at baseline and year 3 visits from 100 control women was 0.68. Of the selected 1609, a total of 1600 (799 cases and 801 controls) had sufficient serum samples available for selenium assay.<SEP>Five selenoenzymes (GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4 and SEPP1) have been reported to be both purportedly associated with oxidative stress and expressed in the colorectal tissue. Each set of putative functionalnon-synonymous SNPs and tagging SNPs (tagSNP) were genotyped in order to efficiently capture the overall variation of the gene. To select tagSNPs, we first sequenced the genes in European American subjects in HapMap population. Using this sequencing data, we selected all SNPs in the selenocysteine insertion sequence, which facilitates selenoenzyme synthesis by a unique stem-loop structure, and all nonsynonymous SNPs in exons. We then selected additional tagSNPs from our sequencing data using criteria of linkage disequilibrium (LD) of r2 ≥0.8, and minor allele frequency of ≥5%. A total of 42 SNPs were genotyped using Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization Time-of-Flight on the Sequenom MassARRAY 7K platform (Sequenom, Inc., San Diego CA). Each plate included 5% blinded duplicates from the study samples as QC. We excluded two SNPs (rs75404373 and rs3763011) due to <90% call rate, three SNPs (rs6888691, rs376301 and rs757229) due to a p-value of <0.01 for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and two SNPs (rs2074452 and rs7579) due to low concordance of blinded duplicates (<90%). For the remaining SNPs, the concordance rate of the blinded duplicates was >95% (average 99.9%). Thus, the final analysis included 34 SNPs.<SEP>Statistical analyses<SEP>We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI for colorectal cancer risk associated with increasing serum selenium concentrations given that results were similar when we used conditional logistic regression (data not shown) and unconditional analysis may be beneficial with larger sample size. A linear trend of the association was tested by assigning each observation the quintile median serum selenium based on the distribution in controls and treating this as a continuous variable. All analyses were adjusted for the following four matching factors: age at screening, enrollment date to the study (days), race/ethnicity, and hysterectomy. In addition, the following known and potential risk factors for colorectal cancer were evaluated as confounders: physical activity (MET-hours/week), body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), smoking (pack-years; never, former or current), alcohol consumption (six categories ranging from non-drinker to seven or more drinks/week), NSAID use [longest duration (days) of any NSAID use; yes or no], postmenopausal hormone use (years of use; never, former or current), family history of colorectal cancer (yes or no), history of colorectal cancer screening (yes, no or missing), history of adenomas and polyps removals (yes or no), education (four categories ranged from less than high school to college degree or higher), total energy intake (kcal/day), red meat intake (serving/day), vegetable and fruit intake (serving/day), dietary and supplemental folate intake (μg/day), dietary fiber intake (g/day), and dietary and supplemental calcium intake (mg/day). For all variables with the numbers of missing values <5% and family history of colorectal cancer, which had 8.8% missing values, the mean value or the most common category were substituted for missing values. The final multivariate model included education and postmenopausal hormone use, since each changed the β-coefficients of the risk estimate for serum selenium by ≥10%.<SEP>We also used unconditional logistic regression to examine the association between genetic variations in five selenoenzymes and colorectal cancer. Analyses were adjusted for the four matching factors. Genetic variants were coded based on log-additive model by assigning the number of copies of the minor allele (i.e., zero for homozygote common allele, one for heterozygotes, and two for homozygote rare allele). The OR of the regression model describes the change in the risk of colorectal cancer per minor allele and the p value describes the significance of the linear trend. To account for multiple comparisons, a global gene test was used to test whether the overall variation within each gene was associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. This test was conducted by comparing the log likelihood ratio statistics of the model with and without all SNPs in one gene (each SNP coded as 0/1/2).<SEP>Interactions of serum selenium concentrations (continuous) with age at screening (continuous), smoking (never, former or current), postmenopausal hormone use (never, former or current), and genetic variants in selenoenzymes (log-additive model) were also evaluated. Interaction effects were tested by including cross-product terms in the regression models and comparing the log likelihood ratio statistics of the main effect model with the joint effects model.<SEP>Meta-Analysis<SEP>A meta-analysis was conducted to compare our results from the WHI with previous studies on selenium and risk of colorectal cancer (the number of studies conducted on genetic variants in selenoenzymes were too small to conduct a meta-analysis). Studies were identified through searches of PubMed using the search term, “selenium” and either “colorectal cancer” or “colon cancer” or “colorectal adenoma.” The last search was conducted on September 27, 2010. All articles were screened by two investigators (YT and UP) to assess whether they provided sufficient information. We restricted analysis to observational studies that assessed selenium as blood or toenail concentrations and randomized clinical trials that used selenium supplements. Because questionnaire data do not provide reliable estimates on selenium intake due to large variation in the selenium content of the same food and the fact that selenium supplements only present a relative small fraction of the overall selenium intake, we did not include studies using questionnaires to assess selenium intake. As colorectal cancer and adenoma tend to have a similar risk profile, both outcomes were included in the meta-analysis. In order to include as many studies as possible for overall and gender-specific analyses, if the risk estimate and/or the corresponding 95% CI were missing in a given article, attempts were made to contact the author(s) to obtain this information. Three studies were excluded due to insufficient information. No other additional screening or eligibility criteria were used, leaving 15 studies (including the current study) in the meta-analysis. For each article, the following information was extracted: first author name, year of publication, mean or median blood or toenail concentration, sample size, OR/HR and 95% CI. For observational studies, the meta-analysis included the risk estimate comparing the highest quantile (quintile, quartile or tertile) of selenium concentrations with the lowest, except for two studies which reported only the risk estimate based on a given cut-off [median or 75th percentile ]. For clinical trials, the risk estimate comparing the selenium supplemented with the placebo groups was used. Risk estimates from individual studies were combined and the corresponding summary 95% CI and p-values were obtained under a random-effects meta-analysis model. Forest plots were used to display the results from individual studies, as well as the summary results. In order to investigate heterogeneity among studies, we calculated I2 statistics, which is a measure of the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity beyond chance, and obtained the heterogeneity p-values based on Cochran’s Q statistic. Funnel plot was used to assess potential selection or publication bias. Subgroup analyses by gender, biospecimen type (blood vs. toenail selenium), colorectal outcome (colorectal cancer vs. adenoma), and time of selenium assessment (before or after diagnosis of colorectal tumors; clinical trials were included in the before diagnosis group because the effect of selenium supplementation was assessed prospectively) were performed.","Results<SEP>WHI Observational Study<SEP>Cases and controls did not differ by age and race/ethnicity because they were matched on these criteria (Table 1). Cases were less educated, had slightly higher BMI, were less physically active, smoked more, and used postmenopausal hormone less often than controls. Use of NSAIDs and selenium supplements was similar between cases and controls. Intakes of calcium and dietary fiber were lower in cases than controls. Most cases were diagnosed with cancer in the colon (81.1%). Given that our participants were recruited from 40 different WHI clinical centers across the United States, the range of serum selenium concentrations was wide (81.0-398.7 μg/L); however, the mean concentrations were relatively high (135.6 ± 21.1 μg/L in controls).<SEP>Serum selenium concentration was not associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (p for trend = 0.10); the adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for colorectal cancer risk comparing the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th quintiles of serum selenium concentrations with the 1st quintile were 1.13 (0.82-1.56), 1.16 (0.84-1.59), 1.34 (0.98-1.84) and 1.26 (0.91-1.73), respectively (Table 2). While results of site-specific analyses did not differ between colon and rectum (p = 0.18), the positive association between serum selenium and risk of colon cancer was marginally significant (p = 0.05). There were no statistically significant interactions of serum selenium with age (p for interaction = 0.41), smoking (p for interaction = 0.12), and postmenopausal hormone use (p for interaction = 0.29).<SEP>Only one SNP in GPX4 gene (rs8178974) was statistically significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk (p for trend = 0.02); however, the overall variation in GPX4 gene was not associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (global p = 0.20) (Supplementary Table and Supplementary Figure 1). All other SNPs, either tested individually or combined within a gene, were not associated with colorectal cancer risk. When stratified by White and African-Americans, results generally did not differ from the overall analyses. Genetic variants in selenoenzymes did not modify the association between serum selenium and colorectal cancer (global p for interaction = 0.09 to 0.87, Supplementary Figure 2).<SEP>Meta-Analysis<SEP>The meta-analysis showed a statistically significant inverse association between selenium and colorectal tumor risk (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.71-0.92) (Figure 1); however, results were heterogeneous (I2 = 59.5%; p = 0.001). Similar results were obtained after excluding the two clinical trials (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.70-0.92, I2 = 60.4%, p = 0.001). When stratified by gender, selenium was significantly and inversely associated with colorectal tumor risk in men (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.57-0.82) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 16.7%; p = 0.29) (Figure 2). Among women, there was no association (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.79-1.18), but results remained heterogeneous (I2 = 49.5%; p = 0.045). The protective association was stronger for studies that measured selenium after colorectal tumor diagnosis compared with those that measured selenium before diagnosis (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.47-0.80, vs. OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.76-1.02); however, this did not explain the heterogeneity between studies (Supplementary Figure 3A). The inverse association between selenium and colorectal tumors was limited to studies measuring selenium in serum/plasma (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.68-0.90) and there was no association in studies measuring selenium in toenails, although only three studies were included (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.70-1.44) (Supplementary Figure 3B). The inverse association was stronger for colorectal adenoma (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.57-0.85) than cancer (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.76-1.06; Supplementary Figure 3C). Based on visual inspection of funnel plots, there was potential evidence for publication bias, with a slightly higher number of small studies reporting inverse associations (Supplementary Figures 4A-C), which is in the expected direction.","Discussion<SEP>In this large study of postmenopausal women, serum selenium concentrations were not associated with colorectal cancer risk. This finding is consistent with findings from our meta-analysis, showing no association between selenium and colorectal tumors among women and an inverse association among men. Furthermore, there was no evidence for association between genetic variants in selenoenzymes and risk of colorectal cancer and results for serum selenium did not differ by genetic variants in selenoenzymes.<SEP>In comparison with selenium supplementation trials, our finding is consistent with secondary analysis from SELECT, but inconsistent with those from the NPCT. The discrepant findings between these clinical trials could potentially be due to the use of different selenium supplements, selenized yeast (NPCT), which contains a mixture of different selenium forms and purified selenomethionine (SELECT), a major active component of the selenized yeast. Furthermore, the discrepant findings could be explained by a proposed threshold effect of selenium on the GPX1 activity, which plateaus at selenium concentration of approximately 80 to 100 μg/L. NPCT specifically recruited participants from areas in the United States with relatively low soil selenium content, resulting in a baseline mean plasma selenium concentration of 114 μg/L. In contrast, SELECT recruited participants from areas throughout North America including the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico; a baseline median serum selenium concentration in SELECT was 135 μg/L, which was similar to the current WHI study (mean = 136 μg/L). Accordingly, baseline selenium concentrations in SELECT and the WHI study may be in a range where further selenium supplementation has no additional cancer preventive effect. Nonetheless, previous observational studies provide conflicting results regarding a threshold effect of selenium. Three small studies with low average selenium concentrations that were similar to those in the NPCT found no association between selenium and colorectal cancer risk, while two studies with selenium concentrations higher than reported in NPCT observed an inverse association.<SEP>Motivated by previous findings of gender-based differences, we conducted a gender-stratified meta-analysis and found statistically significant evidence for association between selenium and colorectal tumors among men only. Note, however, that the largest clinical trial, SELECT, which was only conducted in men, did not find an effect of selenium on colorectal cancer. Results from clinical trials should generally be given more emphasis, because they are not subject to some of the biases in observational studies. The potential gender-difference in the association of selenium with colorectal cancer risk may be due to differences in selenium metabolism and selenoenzyme activity. In particular, men had higher serum selenium concentrations than women in populations in the United States (n = 14,619) and France (n = 13,017). In terms of urinary excretion, women had a higher selenium concentration in urine than men, after adjusting for body weight. Hence, these previous findings suggest that men may retain selenium more efficiently than women. GPX1 activity may also be higher in women than in men. These findings are intriguing; however, given the limited evidence, the mechanisms behind a potential gender-difference on the effect of selenium need to be further elucidated.<SEP>We observed a stronger association between selenium concentrations and colorectal tumor risk among studies that measured selenium after diagnosis of colorectal tumors than those measured before the diagnosis. Although this difference did not explain the observed heterogeneity, this finding is potentially relevant given that it may point to reverse causality in studies where selenium was measured after diagnosis.<SEP>Given the reported differences in molecular characteristics of tumors and dietary risk factors between colon and rectum tumors, we investigated the effect of selenium for both cancer sites, separately. Our site-specific analysis showed a marginally significant positive association between selenium concentrations and risk of colon cancer. However, given that our study was not powered for site-specific analysis this finding may be due to chance.<SEP>Our overall null finding for genetic variants in selenoenzymes and colorectal tumors is consistent with most previous studies, although not all. While our study observed marginal evidence for association between one GPX4 SNP (rs8178974) and colorectal cancer risk, the overall genetic variation in GPX4 was not statistically significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk, suggesting that this finding may be due to chance. Previous studies have found that two other GPX4 SNPs (rs713041 and rs2075710) were associated with the risk of colorectal tumors and with selenoenzyme activity and concentrations. However, these two GPX4 SNPs were not in LD with the GPX4 variant (rs8178974) that was associated in our study (r2 = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). Given that we likely need to expect similar effect sizes as demonstrated in genome-wide association studies for colorectal cancer (OR <1.15), the power of the current and previous studies is limited. This also suggests that an effect, should one exist, is relatively weak.<SEP>A strength of our study includes the large number of cases, making it the largest observational study reported to date on serum selenium and colorectal cancer in women. Blood specimens and exposure information were collected in a prospective cohort setting before colorectal cancer was diagnosed. This reduced the possibility of biases and reverse causality, which may be a potential issue for selenium as discussed above. Our quality control measures for blinded QCs demonstrated high quality of the measurements. Although our study population had a wide range of serum selenium concentrations (81.0-398.7 μg/L), this range did not include individuals with selenium-deplete concentrations (<80 μg/L). Our participants who were recruited from areas with similarly low soil selenium content than the NPCT had average selenium concentrations much higher (138 μg/L) than those in the NPCT (114 μg/L). Nonetheless, our average concentrations were similar to those in other recent studies conducted in the United States. Hence, the difference in selenium concentrations between the NPCT and our study might be explained by factors other than the soil selenium content, such as global food distribution, which has increased over time. Accordingly, in order to test if selenium has a protective effect in selenium-deplete population, future studies may need to be conducted outside the United States in areas with low selenium concentration and a more local food distribution, such as areas in China.<SEP>This study also has some limitations. As previous studies, our study used biospecimens collected at one time point to assess long-term selenium intake. Nonetheless, the correlation between baseline and the year 3 samples measured in 100 control women was relatively high (r = 0.68), suggesting that a single measurement can be used to reflect, although not perfectly, long-term intake, as previously reported. Furthermore, selenium concentration in serum may not be reflective of selenium concentration in the target tissue, colorectal tissue in our study, as we previously observed for the prostate. Because we selected genetic variants from Caucasians, the genetic coverage of African-Americans and other ancestries in our participants might not be sufficient.<SEP>In conclusion, our study is among the largest prospective studies in women to comprehensively investigate the association of serum selenium and genetic variants in selenoenzymes with colorectal cancer risk. This study with relatively high selenium concentrations observed no association between serum selenium and colorectal cancer risk; a result consistent with previous studies in women. In contrast, our meta-analysis found an inverse association in men. Furthermore, we observed no associations between genetic variations in some selenoenzyme genes and colorectal cancer risk, nor did we find evidence of an interaction between genetic variation and serum selenium.",26106,"['OBWCCE', 'VITMIN']"
27158904,"The microbial community in the human gastrointestinal tract is fundamental to the health and nutrition of the host. Loss of the fragile equilibrium within this complex ecosystem, termed dysbiosis, is involved in numerous pathologies, including IBD. The incidence of IBD increased during the 20th century and continues to rise. IBD develops as a result of a combination of genetic predisposition, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, and environmental influences. CARD9, one of the numerous IBD susceptibility genes, encodes an adaptor protein that integrates signals downstream of pattern recognition receptors. CARD9 is particularly involved in the immune response to fungi via C-type lectin sensing, but it also has a role in response to bacteria by mediating nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2)-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14; also known as p38)]–Janus kinase (JNK) signaling and modulating Toll-like receptor signaling. CARD9 promotes recovery from colitis through activation of the IL-22 pathway, and Card9−/− mice are more susceptible to colitis and have an increased load of gut-resident fungi. Dysbiosis is often viewed as a contributor to intestinal inflammation owing to increased numbers of pro-inflammatory microorganisms. However, a lack of microorganisms that have regulatory functions may also enhance inflammation.<SEP>Recent data have suggested that tryptophan catabolites generated by metabolism by the microbiota have a role in mucosal immune responses via AHR by modulating production of IL-22, a cytokine with well-known effects on intestinal homeostasis. Here we assessed the interaction between CARD9, the microbiota and tryptophan in intestinal homeostasis.","ONLINE METHODS<SEP>Mice<SEP>Card9-deficient mice (Card9−/−) on the C57BL/6J background have been described previously. After rederivation at Charles River Laboratories, the animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Saint-Antoine Research Center. Heterozygous mice (Card9+/−) were used as breeders. At weaning, mice were separated according to genotype. Germ-free C57BL/6J mice were bred in germ-free isolators at the CDTA (Transgenese et Archivage Animaux Modèles, CNRS, UPS44, Orléans, France). Conventional mice were fed a standard chow diet (R03, SAFE, Augy, France) and germ-free mice were fed a diet without yeast (R04, SAFE, Augy, France). All conventional WT and Card9−/− mice used in this study were 8-week-old mice. Animal experiments were performed according to the institutional guidelines approved by the local ethics committee of the French authorities, the ‘Comité d’Ethique en Experimentation Animale’ (COMETHEA) and registered with the following national number C2EA-24.<SEP>Gut microbiota transfer and isolation of bacterial strains from feces<SEP>Fresh stool samples from WT or Card9−/− mice (8-week-old males) were immediately transferred to an anaerobic chamber, in which the stool samples were suspended and diluted in LYHBHI (Brain-heart infusion) medium (BD Difco, Le Pont De Claix, France) supplemented with cellobiose (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), maltose (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and cysteine (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). These fecal suspensions were used either to inoculate mice or to isolate bacterial strains. WT germ-free mice (4- to 5-week-old females) were randomly assigned to two groups and inoculated via oral gavage with 400 μl of fecal suspension (1:100) from the conventional wild-type (WT→GF) or Card9−/− (Card9−/−→GF) mice and maintained in separate isolators. One aliquot of each fecal suspension was stored at –80 °C. All experiments in WT→GF and Card9−/−→GF mice were performed three weeks after inoculation. For the isolation of bacterial strains, the highest countable dilution of fecal suspensions was isolated in an anaerobic chamber in YHBHI agar medium (BD Difco) supplemented with cellobiose (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), maltose (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and cysteine (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) or in MRS agar medium (BD Difco) supplemented with cysteine (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Bacterial strains from fecal suspensions were also isolated in aerobic conditions in bile esculin azide agar medium (Biokar Diagnostics, Beauvais, France) or in desoxycholate agar medium (BD Difco). All isolates were routinely maintained by growing for 18–20 h at 37 °C in agar and liquid MRS, YBHI, and Luria–Bertani (BD Difco) medium. Cultures were examined by phase-contrast microscopy for morphology and purity, and stored at –80 °C.<SEP>Induction of DSS colitis and treatments<SEP>To induce colitis, mice were administered drinking water supplemented with 2% (wt./vol.) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; MP Biomedicals, LLC, Aurora, OH, USA) for 7 d and were then allowed to recover by drinking unsupplemented water for the next 5 d (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (Ficz; Enzo Life Sciences, Lausen, Switzerland) and the AHR antagonist CH223191 (AHR−; Sigma-Aldrich) were resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) and administered intraperitoneally. Ficz was injected 1 d after DSS administration (1 μg/mouse). For the AHR− treatment, WT→GF and Card9−/−→GF mice (4- to 5-week-old females) were treated (100 μg/mouse) three times per week until euthanization (Fig. 5c). Controls consisted of mice injected with DMSO vehicle alone for the Ficz and AHR− treatment groups. Three bacteria with strong AHR activity and that were isolated in feces of WT mice were identified by sequencing the 16S rDNA gene as previously described. The resulting sequences were aligned, inspected by eye, and compared with the online tool BLAST. Strains were identified based on the highest hit scores. These strains were deposited in the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Microorganismes (CNCM) of the Institut Pasteur and named L. murinus CNCM I-5020, L. reuteri CNCM I-5022, and L. taiwanensis CNCM I-5019. Bacterial suspensions containing these three strains (109 colony-forming units (c.f.u.) of each strain in 500 μl of PBS) were administered three times per week for a period of 3 weeks to WT→GF and Card9−/−→GF mice (4- to 5-week-old females) by intragastric gavage (Fig. 5c). Oral gavage with PBS was performed in control mice. For the antifungal treatment, mice were fed 0.5 mg/ml fluconazole in drinking water (Sigma-Aldrich) 1 week before DSS administration and every day thereafter, as previously described (Supplementary Fig. 6c). For the IL-22 treatment, WT and Card9−/− mice were injected intraperitoneally three times per week with mouse IL-22–Fc (50 μg/mouse) (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA) (WT IL-22 and Card9−/− IL-22) or an equivalent amount of isotype control (IgG2a) (Genentech) (WT isotype and Card9−/− isotype) for a period of 3 weeks. 3 d after the last injections, colitis was induced by DSS treatment (Supplementary Fig. 13c). In all treatments, body weight, blood in stool, and stool consistency were analyzed daily. The severity of colitis was assessed using the disease activity index (DAI) as previously described.<SEP>Cytokine quantification<SEP>MLNs and spleens were sieved through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD Difco) in complete RPMI 1640 medium (10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin; Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 × 106 cells per well were cultured (37 °C, 10% CO2) for 48 h with stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 50 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and ionomycin (1 μM; Sigma-Aldrich). The culture supernatant was frozen at –80 °C until processing. To measure cytokine levels in the colonic explants, tissues from the medial colon were isolated and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Gibco, Paisley, UK). The colonic explants were cultured (37 °C, 10% CO2) overnight in 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Corning, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) in l ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium. The culture supernatants were collected and stored at –80 °C until processing. ELISAs were performed on the supernatants to quantify the following mouse cytokines according to the manufacturer’s instructions: IL-10, IL-17A, and IFN-γ (Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden); IL-22 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA); and IL-6 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). For the colonic explants, cytokine concentrations were normalized according to the dry weight of each colonic explant.<SEP>Lamina propria cell isolation and flow cytometry<SEP>Cells from the colon and small intestine lamina propria were isolated as previously described. The cells were stimulated and stained as previously described. The following antibodies were used for surface staining of: CD3 (145-2C11, eBioscience); CD4 (L3T4, BD Difco); CD11b (M1/70, eBioscience); CD11c (N418, eBioscience); F4/80 (BM8, eBioscience); CD103 (M290, BD Difco); major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II (M5/114.15.2, BD Dico); TCR-γδ (eBioGL3, eBioscience); and NKp46 (29A1.4, eBioscience). Intracellular cytokine staining was performed using IL-17A (TC11-18H10, BD Difco) and IL-22 (IL-22JOP, eBioscience) antibodies. All antibodies were used at final concentration of 1 μg/ml. The cells were analyzed using a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Leukocytes were gated using forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), and within the leukocyte gates, the innate immune cells were identified as macrophages (MHCII+F4/80+CD103−CD11b+CD11c−) or dendritic cells (MHCII+F4/80− CD103+/−CD11b−CD11c+). For the lymphoid compartment, the leukocytes were gated using FSC and SSC. Within the lymphocyte gate, the populations were identified as TH17 cells (CD3+CD4+IL-17+IL-22+), TH22 cells (CD3+CD4+ IL-17−IL-22+), NKp46+ ILCs (including ILC3 and NK cells; CD3−CD4−NKp46+), LTi cells (CD3−CD4+NKp46−), γδ T cells (CD3+CD4−TCRγδ+) or CD3−CD4−NKp46− cells.<SEP>Histology<SEP>Colon samples for histological studies were maintained at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. 4-μm sections (three sections per sample) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and then examined in a blinded manner using a BX43 Olympus microscope, to determine the histological score according to previously described methods (Supplementary Table 2). The samples were also processed using a Starr Trek kit (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA) or a Novolink Polymer Detection System (Leica Biosystems, Heidelberg, Germany) to stain two mouse cell markers via immunohistochemistry, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using mouse monoclonal anti-Ki67 antibody (MM1, Leica Biosystems; 1:50) for cell proliferation and rabbit polyclonal anti–caspase-3 (cleaved at Asp175) antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom; cat.# ab52293; 1:150) for apoptosis. The number of cleaved caspase-3+ cells in 100 μm of analyzed colon was counted. Ki67 was quantified as a percentage of the total height of each crypt. For each sample, ten areas or crypts were analyzed.<SEP>Gene expression analysis using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT–PCR)<SEP>Total RNA was isolated from colon samples using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative RT–PCR was performed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Saint Aubin, France) and then a Takyon SYBR Green PCR kit (Eurogentec, Liège, Belgium) in a StepOnePlus apparatus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with specific mouse oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides used were as follows: Gapdh (sense) 5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3′ and (antisense) 5′-ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA-3′; Il17a (sense) 5′-TTTAACTCCCTTGGCGCAAAA-3′ and (antisense) 5′-CTTTCCCTCCGCATTGACAC-3′; Il22 (sense) 5′-CATGCAGGAGGTGGTACCTT-3′ and (antisense) 5′-CAGACGCAAGCATTTCTCAG-3′; Reg3g (sense) 5′-TTCCTGTCCTCCATGATCAAAA-3′ and (antisense) 5′-CATCCACCTCTGTTGGGTTCA-3′; and Reg3b (sense) 5′-ATGCTGCTCTCCTGCCTGATG-3′ and (antisense) 5′-CTAATGCGTGCGGAGGGTATATTC-3′. We used the 2−ΔΔCt quantification method with mouse Gapdh as an endogenous control and the WT or WT→GF group as a calibrator.<SEP>Fecal DNA extraction and fungal quantification via quantitative PCR (qPCR)<SEP>Fecal DNA was extracted from the weighted stool samples as previously described. More precisely, the feces samples were weighed and then resuspended for 10 min at room temperature in 250 μl of 4 M guanidine thiocyanate in 0.1 M Tris (pH 7.5) (Sigma) and 40 μl of 10% N-lauroyl sarcosine (Sigma). After the addition of 500 μl of 5% N-lauroyl sarcosine in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), the 2-ml tubes were incubated at 70 °C for 1 h. One volume (750 ml) of a mixture of 0.1- and 0.6-mm-diameter silica beads (Sigma) (previously sterilized by autoclaving) was added, and the tube was shaken at 6.5 Meter/second three times for 30 s each in a FastPrep (MP Biomedicals) apparatus. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (15 mg) was added to the tube, which was then vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000g. After recovery of the supernatant, the pellets were washed with 500 μl of TENP (50 mM Tris (pH 8), 20 mM EDTA (pH 8), 100 mM NaCl, 1% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) and centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000g, and the new supernatant was added to the first supernatant. The washing step was repeated two times. The pooled supernatant (about 2 ml) was briefly centrifuged to remove particles and then split into two 2-ml tubes. Nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of 1 volume of isopropanol for 10 min at room temperature and centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000g. Pellets were resuspended and pooled in 450 μl of 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8, and 50 ml of 5 M potassium acetate. The tube was placed on ice overnight and centrifuged at 20,000g for 30 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a new tube containing 20 μl of RNase (1 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of 50 μl of 3 M sodium acetate and 1 ml of absolute ethanol. The tube was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and the nucleic acids were recovered by centrifugation at 20,000g for 15 min. The DNA pellet was finally washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 100 μl of Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer. DNA suspensions were stored at –20 °C for real-time qPCR analysis of the 16S rDNA or ITS2 sequences. DNA was then subjected to qPCR by using a Takyon SYBR Green PCR kit (Eurogentec) for quantification of all fungal sequences or by using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Life Technologies) for quantification of all bacterial sequences. The probes and primers for the bacterial 16S rDNA genes and primers for the fungal 18S rDNA genes were used as described previously. The threshold cycle for each sample was determined for each gene normalized to the CT value of the all-bacteria 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Data were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method.<SEP>16S rDNA gene sequencing<SEP>DNA was isolated from the feces of mice before and after DSS treatment using the protocol described above. Microbial diversity was determined for each sample by targeting a portion of the ribosomal genes. A 16S rDNA gene fragment comprising the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions (16S (sense) 5′-TACGGRAGGCAGCAG-3′ and (antisense) 5′-CTACCNGGGTATCTAAT-3′) was amplified using an optimized and standardized 16S-amplicon-library preparation protocol (Metabiote, GenoScreen, Lille, France). Briefly, 16S rDNA gene PCR was performed using 5 ng genomic DNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Metabiote) using 192 bar-coded primers (Metabiote MiSeq Primers) at final concentrations of 0.2 μM and an annealing temperature of 50 °C for 30 cycles. The PCR products were purified using an Agencourt AMPure XP-PCR Purification system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), quantified according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and multiplexed at equal concentrations. Sequencing was performed using a 300-bp paired-end sequencing protocol on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at GenoScreen, Lille, France. Raw paired-end reads were subjected to the following process: (1) quality-filtering using the PRINSEQ-lite PERL script by truncating the bases from the 3′ end that did not exhibit a quality <30 based on the Phred algorithm; (2) paired-end read assembly using FLASH (fast length adjustment of short reads to improve genome assemblies) with a minimum overlap of 30 bases and a 97% overlap identity; and (3) searching and removing both forward and reverse primer sequences using CutAdapt, with no mismatches allowed in the primers sequences. Assembled sequences for which perfect forward and reverse primers were not found were eliminated.<SEP>16S rDNA gene sequence analysis<SEP>The sequences were demultiplexed, quality-filtered using the ‘quantitative insights into microbial ecology’ (QIIME, version 1.8.0) software package, and the forward and reverse Illumina reads were joined using the fastq-join method (http://code.google.com/p/ea-utils). The sequences were assigned to OTUs using the UCLUST algorithm with a 97% threshold of pairwise identity and classified taxonomically using the Greengenes reference database. Rarefaction was performed (39,048–84,722 sequences per sample) and used to compare the abundances of OTUs across samples.<SEP>ITS2 rDNA gene sequencing<SEP>DNA was isolated from the feces of mice before and after DSS treatment using the protocol described above. Microbial diversity was determined for each sample by 454 pyrosequencing of the ribosomal genes. An ITS2 rDNA gene fragment of approximately 350 bases was amplified using the primers ITS2 (sense) 5′-GTGARTCATCGAATCTTT-3′ and (antisense) 5′-GATATGCTTAAGTTCAGCGGGT-3′ and the optimized and standardized ITS2-amplicon-library preparation protocol (Metabiote, GenoScreen). Briefly, for each sample, diluted genomic DNA was used for a 25-μl PCR reaction conducted under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; followed by 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified using AmpureXP beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified using a PicoGreen staining kit (Molecular Probes, Paris, France). A second PCR of nine cycles was then conducted under similar conditions with the purified PCR products and 10-bp multiplex identifiers (SIM identifiers) added to the primers at the 5′ position to specifically identify each sample and avoid PCR biases. Finally, the PCR products were purified and quantified as described above. Sequencing was then performed using a Gs-FLX Titanium Sequencing System (Roche Life Science, Mannheim, Germany).<SEP>ITS2 sequence analysis<SEP>The sequences were demultiplexed and quality-filtered using the QIIME version 1.8.0 software package. The sequences were trimmed for bar codes and PCR primers, and were binned for a minimal sequence length of 150 bp, a minimal base quality threshold of 25, and a maximum homopolymer length of 7. The sequences were then assigned to OTUs using the UCLUST algorithm with a 97% threshold of pairwise identity and classified taxonomically using the UNITE ITS database (alpha version 12_11). Rarefaction was performed (2,696–9,757 sequences per sample) and used to compare the abundances of OTUs across samples. For both 16S and ITS2 sequences, principal component analyses (PCA) based on genus composition were performed using the R package Ade4 (ref.) and used to assess the variations among experimental groups. The number of observed species and the Shannon diversity index were calculated using rarefied data (depth = 2,675 sequences/sample for ITS2 and depth = 39,931 sequences/sample for 16S) and were used to characterize species diversity in a community. The sequencing data were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number PRJEB9079.<SEP>Gene expression by microarray analyses<SEP>Total RNA was isolated using the protocol described above. RNA integrity was verified using a Bioanalyser 2100 with RNA 6000 Nano chips (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Transcriptional profiling was performed on mouse colon samples using the SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8 × 60 K Microarray kit (design ID: 028005, Agilent Technologies). Cyanine-3 (Cy3)-labeled cRNAs were prepared with 100 ng of total RNA using a One-Color Low Input Quick Amp Labeling kit (Agilent Technologies), following the recommended protocol. The specific activities and cRNA yields were determined by using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For each sample, 600 ng of Cy3-labeled cRNA (specific activity > 11.0 pmol Cy3/μg of cRNA) were fragmented at 60 °C for 30 min and hybridized to the microarrays for 17 h at 65 °C in a rotating hybridization oven (Agilent Technologies). After hybridization, the microarrays were washed and then immediately dried. After washing, the slides were scanned using a G2565CA Scanner System (Agilent Technologies) at a resolution of 3 μm and a dynamic range of 20 bits. The resulting TIFF images were analyzed using the Feature Extraction Software v10.7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies) according to the GE1_107_Sep09 protocol. The microarray data were submitted to GEO under accession number GSE67577.<SEP>Microarray analysis<SEP>Agilent Feature Extraction software was used to convert scanned signals into tab-delimited text that could be analyzed using third-party software. The R package ‘agilp’ was used to pre-process the raw data. Box plots and PCAs were used to obtain a general overview of the data in terms of the within-array distributions of signals and the between-sample variability. Agilent Feature Extraction software computed a P value for each probe in each array to test whether the scanned signals were significantly higher than the background signal. The null hypothesis was ‘the measured signal is equal to background signal’. Probes were considered to be detected if the P value was <0.05. The probes must have been present in at least 60% of samples per group and under at least one condition to be considered for analysis. To compare data from multiple arrays, the data were normalized to minimize the effect of nonbiological differences. Quantile normalization is a method that can quickly normalize within a set of samples without using a reference base. After normalization, spike-in, positive and negative control probes were removed from the normalized data. For differential expression analysis, we used the limma eBayes test, which finds a compromise between the variance estimate for the gene under consideration and the average variance of all of the genes. The Benjamini–Hochberg correction method was used to control the false-discovery rate (FDR). All significant gene lists were annotated for enriched biological functions and pathways using the DAVID platform for gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms. Significant canonical pathways had adjusted P values, according to Benjamini’s method, below 0.05. We used Venn diagrams to globally visualize the overlap between all significant genes in the WT and Card9−/− comparisons. Thus, DAVID was performed to test for the biological pathway enrichment of Venn’s elements.<SEP>Luciferase assay<SEP>The H1L1.1c2 cell line containing a stably integrated dioxin response elements (DRE)-driven firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pGudLuc1.1 has been described previously. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 7.5 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl of complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin; Sigma-Aldrich) and cultured (37 °C, 10% CO2) for 24 h before treatment. This cell line tested negative for mycoplasma contamination and was used in this study to determine AHR activity of bacterial and stool samples. Fresh stool samples from healthy subjects and patients with IBD in remission, and from mice, were collected, weighed, and stored at –80 °C until processing. Stool samples were suspended, diluted to 100 mg/ml in PBS, centrifuged (5,000 g, 15 min, 4 °C), and filtered (0.2 μm; VWR, Fontenay-sous-Bois, France). Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. were grown in MRS medium (BD Difco, Le Pont De Claix, France) supplemented with 10% cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Allobaculum stercoricanis (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, DSMZ, 13633) was cultivated under the recommended culture conditions listed in the DSMZ. Bacterial strains isolated from feces of WT and Card9−/− mice were cultivated under the culture conditions described above. Culture supernatants of these bacteria were stored at –80 °C until processing. To assess agonistic activity, the cells were treated with stool suspensions diluted at 1:10 in complete DMEM with 0.1% DMSO or with culture supernatants diluted to 2%, 10%, or 20% in complete DMEM. Controls consisted of cells treated with DMEM with 0.1% DMSO or bacterial culture medium as the negative control, or 10 nM of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in DMEM with 0.1% DMSO as the positive control. After 24 h of incubation, wells were washed with 100 μl PBS, and 50 μl Promega lysis buffer was added to each well. The plates were shaken for 30 min to lyse the cells. After adding 100 μl of luciferase reagent (Promega), luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer. The results were normalized based on the negative luciferase activity of the control.<SEP>HPLC–HRMS analysis<SEP>Thawed stools from healthy subjects and patients with IBD in remission, or from mice, were extracted as previously described. L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and L-kynurenine (L-Kyn) were measured via HPLC using a coulometric electrode array (ESA Coultronics, ESA Laboratories, Chelsford, MA, USA). Quantifications were performed by referencing calibration curves obtained with internal standards. Other compounds (tryptamine and IAA) were quantified via liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) by using a Waters ACQUITY ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system equipped with a binary solvent delivery manager and sample manager (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) and that was coupled to a tandem quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface (Waters Corporation). Compounds were identified by comparing with the accurate mass and the retention time of reference standards in our in-house library, and the accurate masses of the compounds were obtained from web-based resources, such as the Human Metabolome Database (http://www.hmdb.ca) and the METLIN database (http://metlin.scripps.edu).<SEP>IBD cohort<SEP>All individuals with IBD were recruited in the Gastroenterology Department of the Saint Antoine Hospital (Paris, France) and provided informed consent. Approval for human studies was obtained from the local ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile-de-France IV, IRB 00003835 Suivitheque study; registration number 2012/05NICB). Remission was defined by global physician assessment and normal serum C-reactive protein (CRP) [levels. Among the 112 patients with IBD included, 101 were genotyped for the rs10781499, rs2066844, rs2066845, rs2066847, rs12994997, and rs11564258 SNPs using Fluidigm (UMR CNRS 8199, Lille, France) (Supplementary Table 1).<SEP>NanoString<SEP>NanoString analysis was performed and analyzed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.<SEP>Statistical analyses<SEP>GraphPad Prism version 6.0 (San Diego, CA, USA) was used for all analyses and preparation of graphs. For all data displayed in graphs, results are expressed as the mean ± s.e.m. For comparisons between two groups, two-tailed Student’s t-test for unpaired data or nonparametric Mann–Whitney test was used. For comparisons between more than two groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Tukey test or nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed by a post hoc Dunn’s test was used. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of normality was applied to all data sets, and in cases where the data did not demonstrate a normal distribution, nonparametric tests were used to analyze statistical differences. An F or Bartlett’s test was performed to determine differences in variances between groups for t-tests and ANOVAs, respectively. An unpaired Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction was applied when variances were not equal.<SEP>No samples, mice, or data points were excluded from the reported analysis. Animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups. All analyses were performed unblended, except for the histological analyses, and were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Sample size was estimated according previous experience using the models described. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. For the human data (Fig. 6a), given the sample size of the two groups compared (n = 37 for healthy subjects and n = 102 for individuals with IBD) the magnitude of the effect that can be detected is 0.54 (with power = 0.8, alpha type I error = 0.05, and two-sided test), which is below the difference we observed (0.71). Moreover, based on the characteristics of the two groups compared (n value, mean, and s.d.), the power of the comparison was calculated to be 95.1% with an alpha type I error set at 0.05. Differences corresponding to P < 0.05 were considered significant.","RESULTS<SEP>Card9−/− mice are more susceptible to colitis<SEP>Recovery is impaired in Card9−/− mice after dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, as compared to that in WT mice, with delayed weight gain and greater histopathologic alterations (Supplementary Fig. 1). Epithelial cell proliferation is reduced and apoptosis is increased, as shown by decreased staining for the proliferation marker Ki67 and increased staining for cleaved caspase 3, respectively, confirming impaired intestinal healing (Fig. 1a,b). To examine the mechanisms responsible for this defect, we compared the colon transcriptomes of wild-type (WT) and Card9−/− mice before and during DSS-induced colitis. The mouse transcriptomes clustered according to genotype (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The number of upregulated genes on day 7 was higher in Card9−/− mice than in WT mice. Pathway analyses of the induced transcripts showed a dominance of immune-related pathways, corresponding to a stronger signal in Card9−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b). During the recovery period (day 12), the pathways involved in cell proliferation and replication were more activated in WT mice than in Card9−/− mice, confirming the healing defect in Card9−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The most induced and differentially expressed genes between Card9−/− and WT mice on days 7 and 12 were regenerating islet-derived 3 gamma (Reg3g; encoding REGIII-γ), Reg3b (encoding REGIII-β) and interleukin 1beta (Il1b) (Fig. 1c). The expression of antimicrobial proteins, such as REGIII-γ and REGIII-β, by intestinal epithelial cells is induced by IL-22 (ref.). Moreover, IL-17A has a protective role in concert with IL-22 (ref.). As assessed by real-time qPCR, colonic expression of Il22, Reg3g, Reg3b, and Il17a was decreased on day 12 in Card9−/− mice (Fig. 1d). In the colon lamina propria, the percentage of IL-22+ cells was decreased in Card9−/− mice on days 0 and 12 (Fig. 1e). Among these cells, the CD3−CD4−NKp46− subset was reduced on day 12 in Card9−/− mice (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 3). These results highlight the role of CARD9 and its effector IL-22 in mediating recovery from DSS-induced colitis. The major role of IL-22 and its target genes Reg3g and Reg3b in the response to bacterial and fungal infections raises questions about the specific role of the microbiota in the hyper-susceptibility to colitis that is observed in Card9−/− mice.<SEP>The gut microbiota is altered in Card9−/− mice<SEP>We next explored the composition of the microbiota at the fungal and bacterial level at baseline and during colitis (Fig. 2). In Card9−/− and WT mice, the colonic fungal load reached a peak at day 7, but it was higher in Card9−/− mice (Fig. 2a). Little is known regarding the diversity of the gut fungal microbiota and how fungi contribute to colitis in mice. We therefore further analyzed the fungal microbiota in feces via high-throughput internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the basis of genus composition revealed major differences between WT and Card9−/− mice at days 0 and 7. The fungal composition in Card9−/− mice was altered at days 0, 7, and 12, whereas it changed only slightly with colitis in WT mice, showing more resilience to DSS-induced perturbation (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4a). Diversity measurements also suggested increased resilience of the fungal microbiota in WT mice than in Card9−/− mice (Fig. 2c). The fungal microbiota of WT and Card9−/− mice was dominated by members of the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) pipeline, we observed several differences in the baseline fecal fungal microbiota composition in Card9−/− mice, as compared to that in WT mice (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 4b). In line with the PCA results, the composition of the fungal microbiota was more altered at days 7 and 12 in Card9−/− mice than in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 5). In parallel, we explored the composition of the fecal bacterial microbiota by using 16S rDNA sequencing. Although the alterations were less marked than for the fungal microbiota, PCA revealed that the baseline bacterial microbiota was different in WT and Card9−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Moreover, the shift in the composition of the bacterial microbiota during colitis followed a similar pattern in WT and Card9−/− mice, but with decreased stability in Card9−/− mice (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Fig. 4c,d). No differences were observed regarding biodiversity between WT and Card9−/− mice at any of the time points (Fig. 2g). The LEfSe analysis revealed differences at baseline, including decreases in Adlercreutzia (genus), Actinobacteria (phylum), and Lactobacillus reuteri in the Card9−/− mouse microbiota (Fig. 2h). In WT mice, there was a negative correlation between bacterial and fungal biodiversity (Fig. 2i), suggesting an inter-kingdom relationship and possibly competition. In contrast, a positive correlation was observed in Card9−/− mice, suggesting abnormal interactions within the gut ecosystem between bacteria and fungi, with possible consequences on gut homeostasis (Fig. 2i). Overall, these data demonstrate that CARD9 has a role in shaping the bacterial and fungal gut microbiota and that it is required to control fungal microbiota expansion in colitis.<SEP>The Card9−/− microbiota has pro-inflammatory effects<SEP>To isolate the effect of the gut microbiota, we colonized WT germ-free (GF) mice with the microbiota of WT (WT→GF) or Card9−/− (Card9−/−→GF) mice and exposed them to DSS. The microbiota transfer was sufficient to recapitulate the phenotype observed in Card9−/− mice, as evidenced by increased susceptibility to colitis and impaired recovery, with decreased epithelial cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (Fig. 3a–d and Supplementary Fig. 6a). However, the fungal component of the microbiota did not seem to be involved in this effect, as fungal levels were similar in WT→GF and Card9−/−→GF mice, and antifungal treatment did not modify the phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 6b–d). To decipher the mechanisms leading to the defective recovery from DSS-induced injury in Card9−/−→GF mice, we assessed the colonic expression levels of 179 inflammation-associated genes using NanoString technology (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Il22 was one of the most highly downregulated genes in Card9−/−→GF mice, as compared to those in WT→GF mice (Fig. 3e), in addition to the chemokine-encoding genes Cxcl1 and Cxcl5 and the transcription-factor-encoding gene Fos, all of which are known IL-22 target genes in epithelial cells. IL-22 has been implicated in intestinal homeostasis, and it mediates innate antimicrobial resistance in mice. Furthermore, similar to Card9−/− and Card9−/−→GF mice, Il22−/− mice are more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis and show impaired healing during the recovery period. Therefore, we postulated that a deficient IL-22 response may underlie impaired recovery of Card9−/−→GF mice during DSS-induced epithelial injury. In agreement with the NanoString results, Il22 expression in the colon was decreased in Card9−/−→GF mice on days 0 and 12 (Fig. 3f). Moreover, the expression levels of Reg3g and Reg3b were reduced in Card9−/−→GF mice, as compared to those in WT→GF mice at days 0 and 7 (Fig. 3f). In contrast, no differences were detected in the expression of Il17a (Fig. 3f) or defensin beta 1 (Defb1), which is a target of IL-17A (Supplementary Fig. 7a). We next confirmed the IL-22 defect in Card9−/−→GF mice at the protein level in the colon and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) at baseline, day 7 and day 12 (Fig. 3g,h). We found no differences in the amounts of IL-17A, IL-6, IFN-γ, or IL-10 in the MLN or colon (Fig. 3g,h and Supplementary Fig. 7b,c), suggesting that the IL-22 axis is specifically impaired in Card9−/−→GF mice. No differences in IL-22 amounts were observed in splenocytes, suggesting a gut-limited defect in Card9−/−→GF mice (Supplementary Fig. 7d). Several sources of IL-22 have been identified in the gut, including innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), natural killer cells, T helper 17 (TH17) and TH22 cells, γδ T cells, and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. Following isolation of intraepithelial and lamina propria cells, we observed that IL-22 production by TH22, NKp46+ ILCs, LTi cells, and CD3−CD4−NKp46− cells was decreased in the colon lamina propria of Card9−/−→GF mice, as compared to that in the colon lamina propria of WT→GF mice on day 12 (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Fig. 8). In contrast, IL-17 production was not altered, and no difference was observed in IL-22 or IL-17 production by intraepithelial γδ T cells (Supplementary Figs. 8c and 9). Intestinal dendritic cells and macrophages, which are involved in the stimulation of IL-22-producing cells via IL-23 production, were also explored, but no differences were observed between Card9−/−→GF and WT→GF mice (Supplementary Fig. 10). These data indicate that the microbiota of Card9−/− mice is defective in inducing IL-22 production by T cells and ILCs in the colon, leading to impaired recovery from DSS-induced colitis.<SEP>Impaired tryptophan metabolism in Card9−/−→GF mice<SEP>Our results suggest that the gut microbiota of Card9−/− mice contributes to susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis by altering IL-22 production. One mechanism that could link these findings is the modulation of AHR activation by the microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract. Tryptophan can be metabolized either by the gut bacteria into indole derivatives, such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or by host cells into kynurenine (Kyn) via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1; Supplementary Fig. 11a). Indole derivatives are AHR ligands (Supplementary Fig. 11b) known to promote local IL-22 production. Therefore, by examining the levels of AHR ligands in the lumen of the colons of germ-free, Ido1−/−, Card9−/−, Card9−/−→GF, WT, and WT→GF mice, we were able to analyze tryptophan metabolism by the host and the gut bacteria. As expected, production of Kyn was impaired in Ido1−/− mice, whereas normal IAA levels were observed. Production of IAA was impaired in GF mice, and Kyn levels were also low, probably because of the underdevelopment of the gut immune system (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 11c,d). Most notably, the levels of IAA in Card9−/−→GF and Card9−/− mice were decreased, whereas the bacterial concentrations within the colons were not modified (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 11c–e), indicating that the change in the microbiota in Card9−/− mice was responsible for the low level of IAA. In line with these data, culture supernatants of L. reuteri and Allobaculum sp., two bacteria with decreased abundance in the Card9−/− mouse microbiota (Fig. 2h), strongly activate AHR (Supplementary Fig. 12a). These results suggest that impaired tryptophan metabolism by the microbiota of the Card9−/− mice could be associated with, or even be responsible for, the hypersusceptibility of Card9−/− mice to colitis.<SEP>Using an AHR reporter system, we found that feces from Card9−/− and Card9−/−→GF mice were defective in their ability to activate AHR, to a similar extent as that for feces from GF mice (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 12b). To assess the in vivo importance of this finding, we administered 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (Ficz), an AHR agonist, to DSS-exposed mice. The severity of colitis (body weight loss, histology score, and colon shortening) was reduced in Card9−/− and Card9−/−→GF mice that were treated with Ficz, as compared to their untreated counterparts during recovery, reaching the level of severity seen in WT or WT→GF mice (Fig. 4c–e and Supplementary Fig. 12c–e). Accordingly, defects in the colonic expression of Il22, Reg3g, and Reg3b in Card9−/− and Card9−/−→GF mice were rescued by Ficz administration (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 12f). This effect was also observed at the protein level for IL-22 in the colon (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 12g). Moreover, supplementation of Card9−/−→GF mice with three Lactobacillus strains, isolated from WT mice for their ability to activate AHR (Fig. 5a,b), rescued susceptibility of Card9−/−→GF mice to colitis, IL-22 expression, and AHR ligand production (Fig. 5c–j). These effects were mediated by AHR, as they were abrogated in the presence of an AHR antagonist (Fig. 5e–j).<SEP>One study showed that the microbiota of Il22−/− mice is altered, and its transfer increases susceptibility of WT mice to colitis. Therefore, we postulated that a deficient IL-22 response may also be involved in the decreased production of AHR ligands by the microbiota. Indeed, microbiota from Il22−/− mice had impaired AHR activity and decreased levels of IAA (Supplementary Fig. 13a,b). Moreover, administration of exogenous IL-22 was sufficient to normalize AHR ligand production and colitis susceptibility in Card9−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 13c–h). These results show that the gut microbiota of Card9−/− mice contributes to the susceptibility of the mice to colitis by altering the IL-22 signaling pathway via impaired tryptophan metabolism, leading to defective AHR activation. In addition, IL-22 is required for the production of AHR ligands by the microbiota (Supplementary Fig. 14). An AHR agonist can effectively counter these defects.<SEP>Reduced AHR activity and tryptophan metabolites in subjects with IBD<SEP>We explored whether these findings were relevant to human disease and analyzed fecal samples from individuals with IBD (Supplementary Table 1) and healthy subjects for their ability to activate AHR. The fecal samples from healthy subjects induced greater activation of AHR than those from patients with IBD (Fig. 6a). This defect was observed in both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (Supplementary Fig. 15a). This finding was associated with decreased levels of tryptophan and IAA, and increased levels of Kyn, in the fecal samples from patients with IBD (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 15b–d). Therefore, activated immune cells in the gut of individuals with IBD may use tryptophan to produce Kyn via IDO1, whereas the metabolism of tryptophan by the gut microbiota is impaired, leading to defective AHR activation. We next searched for a connection between CARD9 and the ability of the microbiota to produce AHR ligands in humans. We genotyped patients with IBD for an IBD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within CARD9 (rs10781499) and found that the risk allele was associated with reduced AHR activation by microbiota-derived metabolites extracted from fecal samples in our in vitro assay (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 15c,d). No association was observed among other major IBD-associated SNP-containing alleles of genes, including NOD2, autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1), and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) (Supplementary Fig. 15e). These results should be confirmed in an independent cohort but suggest a connection between IBD, CARD9, and the ability of the microbiota to produce AHR agonists in humans.","DISCUSSION<SEP>The gut microbiota is a key player in mammalian physiology, and its composition is influenced by genetics, environment, and diet. Any change in these factors can predispose the host to metabolic or inflammatory disorders, including obesity and IBD. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota influences the host remain unknown. It is also unclear whether dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of these diseases. Our results showed that Card9 deletion has an effect on the gut microbiota in mice and that transfer of microbiota from Card9−/− mice to WT GF recipient mice is sufficient to recapitulate the defective IL-22 activation and increased sensitivity to colitis observed in Card9−/− mice. These alterations were due to an impaired ability of the microbiota of Card9−/− mice to catabolize tryptophan into AHR ligands.<SEP>Metabolomics studies have revealed large effects of the gut microbiota on host metabolism. Indole derivatives, which are tryptophan catabolites generated by the microbiota, were recently identified as activators of AHR, which consequently regulates local IL-22 production. Any modification in AHR ligand production impacts IL-22 levels and, therefore, acts on the fragile equilibrium between the microbiota and the host cells. In accordance with this model, the Card9−/− mouse microbiota has decreased levels of bacteria that have tryptophan-catabolizing functions, such as L. reuteri, and members of the genus Allobaculum and the phylum Actinobacteria. Moreover, the susceptibility of GF mice that received microbiota from Card9−/− mice (Card9−/−→GF mice) to colitis and the decreased AHR ligand production were rescued by supplementation with AHR-ligand-producing Lactobacillus strains. Thus, our results provide evidence that defects in expression of factors involved in innate immunity, such as CARD9, can shape an altered microbiota, which can then modify the host immune response. Our results are relevant to humans, as impaired microbial production of AHR ligands is observed in patients with IBD and correlates with an IBD-associated SNP within CARD9 (rs10781499). Consequently, the tryptophan catabolites derived from gut microbiota could be used as biomarkers for dysbiosis and may be targeted for the development of new therapeutic drugs for individuals with IBD. For instance, indole derivatives, or the probiotic organisms that produce them, could be used as a supportive therapy in individuals with intestinal dysbiosis. Our findings support a more general concept that suggests that, owing to their tight relationship, the respective roles of the host factors and the gut microbiota in IBD pathogenesis cannot be completely distinguished. Thus, dysbiosis should neither be considered a cause nor a consequence of IBD, but both simultaneously. We hypothesize that the altered immune response in Card9−/− mice has an effect on the microbiota. In turn, the modified microbiota alters tryptophan catabolite production, affecting the host’s immune response and amplifying dysbiosis in a vicious cycle that leads to the loss of intestinal homeostasis.",47530,"['OBWCCE', 'FOODIN', 'FOODAL']"
30624993,"Introduction<SEP>Beta-2-microglobulin (β2M), an essential component of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is freely filtered in the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, with circulating levels tightly maintained in healthy individuals. A prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating β2M identified genetic variants at the MHC and SH2B3 genetic loci, with one of the top single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for circulating β2M at the SH2B3 locus, rs3184504, also being a genome-wide significant SNP for blood pressure (BP). Therefore, given the concurrence of genetic variants for BP and circulating β2M, we hypothesized that β2M may be a causal factor for hypertension.<SEP>Hypertension is preventable through lifestyle interventions and drug treatment, but it still remains the most widespread non-communicable disease worldwide. Previous population studies of β2M and hypertension are either limited to cross-sectional analyses or did not consider kidney disease status. To address these limitations, we sought to determine whether plasma β2M was associated with hypertension cross-sectionally and longitudinally and to assess its potential clinical utility as a prognostic indicator of hypertension risk. We also performed secondary analyses excluding individuals with albuminuria and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline because elevated urinary β2M levels have been reported to be associated with impaired kidney function. Lastly, we provide results of a functional study in Sh2b3 knockout mice to explore a causal role of the SH2B3-β2M axis in hypertension.","Materials and Methods<SEP>All source data and materials have been made publicly available at dbGaP (accession number phs000363.v17.p11).<SEP>Study population:<SEP>The cross-sectional study sample consisted of Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring and Third Generation cohort participants. A total of 7242 participants had measurements of plasma β2M at the baseline examination (Offspring cohort examination 7 [1999–2003, n=3267] and Third Generation cohort examination 1 [2002–2005, n=3975]). Participants with the following conditions were excluded: myocardial infarction or heart failure prior to baseline; missing information regarding use of anti-hypertensive treatment, lipid lowering treatment, and diabetes medication use; and missing information on cigarette smoking, body-mass index, fasting glucose, total- or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or serum creatinine – leaving a final cross-sectional sample size of 7065.<SEP>Participants who attended the follow-up examination (Offspring cohort examination 8 [2005–2008] and Third Generation cohort examination 2 [2008–2011]) approximately six years after baseline (median 6.0, 25th and 75th percentiles 6.0, 7.0 years after baseline) and were normotensive at baseline, made up the longitudinal study sample (n=4189). Secondary longitudinal analyses were performed after excluding those with albuminuria (defined as urinary albumin-creatinine ratio [UACR]≥30mg/g) or low eGFR (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) at baseline.<SEP>Quantification of plasma β2M protein:<SEP>Plasma β2M concentration was measured at baseline as part of the Systems Approach to Biomarker Research in Cardiovascular Disease (SABRe CVD) Initiative. A modified sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, multiplexed on a Luminex xMAP platform (Sigma-Aldrich) was used, as described previously. All targets were first developed as single assays, after which compatible targets, with appropriate plasma analyte concentration ranges, were combined to form multiplex panels to avoid cross-reactivity. For the β2M assay, the detection antibody was product #200–406-141s (Rockland Antibodies, Limerick, PA), the capture antibody was GTX20759 (Genetex, Irvine, CA), and the reference protein was #126–11 (Lee BioSolutions, Maryland Heights, MO). The mean intra-assay coefficient of variation for β2M was 3.7%.<SEP>Data collection for covariates:<SEP>Each FHS examination consisted of an in-person interview, physician-administered physical examination, anthropometric measurements, BP measurements, and blood/urine sample collection. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m2). Current cigarette smoking was defined as self-reported smoking of at least one cigarette per day, on average, during the year preceding the examination. Information on antihypertensive and lipid lowering medication-use was collected via a self-administered questionnaire and verified using medications that participants brought to the research clinic visit. Diabetes was defined as fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, or the current use of insulin or hypoglycemic medication. Participant spot urine samples were used to measure urinary albumin and creatinine levels, from which the UACR was calculated. Albuminuria was defined as a UACR equal to or greater than 30 mg/g. Serum creatinine levels, measured using the Roche Hitachi 911 reader, were quantified using the modified Jaffe method with a modified picric acid buffer solution to minimize interference and weighted by population-specific distributions of age and sex. eGFR was calculated using the CKD-epi equation. CKD was defined as eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m2.<SEP>BP measurement:<SEP>BP was measured at the baseline and follow-up examinations. Systolic and diastolic BP were each measured twice by a physician in the left arm after five minutes of rest in the seated position, and mean values were used. Hypertension was defined as systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg, or current antihypertensive medication use.<SEP>Statistical Analyses:<SEP>Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to account for familial correlations in testing the association of baseline β2M concentration with prevalent and new-onset hypertension. In the GEE models, nuclear family members were considered as clusters of measurements. The logit link function was applied for the dichotomous response variable, hypertension. All analyses for prevalent hypertension were adjusted for the following baseline covariates: age, sex, study cohort, BMI, diabetes, cigarette smoking, levels of total and HDL-cholesterol, statin-use, and eGFR. Analyses for new-onset hypertension were adjusted for the same baseline covariates, along with baseline systolic and diastolic BP. Secondary analyses were performed after excluding individuals with prevalent CKD or albuminuria.<SEP>Reclassification analyses were conducted by comparing the predictive abilities of regression models with and without plasma β2M for new-onset hypertension, and used the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) metrics. Bootstrapping with 1000 iterations was used for probability estimates, and two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.4.<SEP>Mendelian Randomization (MR):<SEP>A two-sample inverse-variance weighted MR approach was used to test whether SH2B3 expression was causal for plasma β2M levels. Pruned cis-eQTL variants (LD r2<0.1) for SH2B3 expression were used as instrumental variables (IVs) for SH2B3 expression with SH2B3 expression as the exposure and circulating β2M levels as the outcome. SH2B3 expression was measured as previously described. Briefly, fasting whole blood samples were collected from FHS participants in PAXgene™ tubes (PreAnalytiX, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from frozen PAXgene tubes by Asuragen, Inc, and used to generate cDNA. The cDNA was fragmented and labeled using the FL-Ovation™ cDNA Biotin Module, after which the resultant cDNA fragments were allowed to hybridize overnight to the Affymetrix human exon 1.0 ST microarray platform according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The GeneChip™ 7G GCS3000 scanner (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to laser scan the microarray following washing and staining using the GeneChip™ Fluidics Station 450. Intensity values for each gene chip were compiled and normalized using the robust multi-chip average method from Affymetrix Power Tools Software version 1.12.0 (Affymetrix) before and after quality control.<SEP>All MR analyses were conducted using MRbase (http://www.mrbase.org/). Causal effect estimates of SH2B3 expression on plasma β2M levels are reported as effect per risk allele on inverse rank-normalized protein level. Because we lacked cis-pQTL variants for circulating β2M levels, we were unable to conduct MR analyses to determine if plasma β2M is causal for hypertension.<SEP>Mouse Models:<SEP>Wild-type (WT) C57B1/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Sh2b3-deficient C57BL/6J mice were generated by deleting exons 3–8 of Sh2b3, as previously described. Osmotic mini-pumps (model 2002, Alzet, DURECT Corporation, City, State) were implanted subcutaneously in mice approximately 8–12 weeks of age for angiotensin II (490 ng/kg/min) or vehicle (sodium chloride/acetic acid solution) infusion for 14 days. RNA was extracted from whole blood of WT and Sh2b3−/− mice using a RiboPure™ RNA purification Kit (Cat# AM1928, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and cDNA was constructed using VANTAGE (Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN). RNA sequencing reads first underwent quality control (QC) using the FASTX-Toolkit package (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/), after which they were mapped to the mouse reference genome (UCSC mm10) using Tophat v2.0. mRNA levels were estimated and normalized using Cufflinks v2.2 and are reported in expected number of fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per million base pairs sequenced (FPKM). Cuffdiff was used to identify differential expression of β2M between WT and SH2B3−/− mice (http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffdiff/).","Results<SEP>Baseline characteristics:<SEP>Summary demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample (mean age 49 years, 54% women) are shown in Table 1 according to β2M quartiles and in Table S1 for the overall study sample.<SEP>Cross-sectional analyses:<SEP>Baseline β2M concentration was positively associated with prevalent hypertension after adjusting for clinical covariates with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.24, P=0.003) per standard deviation increase in log-transformed β2M, and an OR of 1.29 (95% CI 1.05–1.57, P=0.01) for the top versus bottom β2M quartile (Table 2).<SEP>Longitudinal analyses:<SEP>A total of 886 (21%) participants who were normotensive at baseline developed new-onset hypertension after a mean follow-up of six years. Results of the GEE model revealed a significant association between baseline β2M and risk of new-onset hypertension with an OR of 1.18 (95% CI 1.07–1.32, P=0.001) per standard deviation increase in log-transformed β2M (Table 3). Results of the quartile analysis showed that the top β2M quartile had a 1.59-fold risk (95% CI 1.20, 2.11, P=0.001) of incident hypertension versus those in the bottom quartile (Table 3). Excluding individuals with albuminuria and low eGFR at baseline did not materially change the results (Table S2).<SEP>Reclassification Analyses:<SEP>Reclassification metrics revealed that β2M improved the prediction of new-onset hypertension over the clinical model, which consisted of the following baseline covariates: age, sex, study cohort, BMI, diabetes, cigarette smoking, levels of total and HDL-cholesterol, statin-use, eGFR, and systolic and diastolic BP. Addition of β2M to the clinical model improved the discrimination for new onset hypertension in the overall sample (integrated discrimination improvement [IDI] 0.0021, P=0.03) and in those free of baseline albuminuria and CKD (IDI=0.0036, P=0.008; Table 4). The continuous net reclassification index (NRI) was statistically significant in participants free of baseline albuminuria and low eGFR (NRI 0.030, P=0.02) but not in the general sample (P>0.05; Table 4).<SEP>Mendelian randomization:<SEP>As the top genetic variant (rs3184504) associated with plasma β2M levels is also associated with SH2B3 expression, we postulated that the trans-effects (>1 megabase upstream or downstream of the transcription start site) of the rs3184504 polymorphism on β2M levels may be mediated through its cis-effects (within 1 megabase) on SH2B3 expression. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two-sample inverse-variance weighted MR using all independent cis variants (LD r2<0.1) for SH2B3 expression as instrumental variables, SH2B3 expression as the exposure, and circulating β2M levels as the outcome. Decreased SH2B3 expression was found to be causal for higher β2M levels (β=−16.8, P=8.7E-11; Fig. 1).<SEP>Sh2b3−/− mouse model:<SEP>To recapitulate the effects of cis genetic variation within SH2B3, we tested the effects of SH2B3 deficiency on β2M expression at baseline and in response to angiotensin II-induced hypertension. The rs3184504 polymorphism is associated with reduced SH2B3 function in humans, and we previously reported that Sh2b3−/− mice had a greater hypertensive response and more severe renal/vascular dysfunction in response to angiotensin II infusion. Analysis of RNA sequencing performed on whole blood from wild type and Sh2b3−/− mice revealed a significant induction of β2M expression in response to angiotensin II administration only in Sh2b3−/− mice (P=0.037; Fig. 2) suggesting that SH2B3 normally constrains β2M expression in response to hypertensive stimuli and that enhanced β2M expression may be causally related to the exaggerated hypertensive response and end-organ damage seen in Sh2b3−/− animals.","Discussion<SEP>Motivated by GWAS variants at the SH2B3 locus that were reported to be associated both with BP and circulating β2M levels, we first explored the association of circulating β2M with prevalent and incident hypertension in a large community-based cohort study. We found that circulating β2M was associated with clinically relevant increases in prevalent and new-onset hypertension, replicating association results previously reported by investigators from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Secondary longitudinal association analyses between β2M and hypertension conducted in FHS participants free of baseline CKD and albuminuria demonstrated similar effect sizes and consistent directions of effect compared to the overall study sample, thus suggesting β2M is more than a marker of renal dysfunction. Our MR analyses and mechanistic study in mice suggest that the SH2B3-β2M axis may play a causal role in BP regulation. Reclassification analyses, however, reveal that whereas the addition of β2M to a clinical model improved hypertension prediction, the magnitude of effect suggests that circulating β2M level is not likely to be a clinically useful biomarker of hypertension risk.<SEP>Hypertension is a complex disorder with a prominent renal component characterized by impaired renal sodium excretion, vascular remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis. Genes within the HLA and SH2B3 regions have been implicated in inflammation, and recent Sh2b3-knockout studies in mice have linked mutations or deletions in SH2B3 with kidney inflammation, hypertension, and atherosclerotic CVD. Therefore, we sought to determine if there was a mechanistic link between SH2B3, β2M, and hypertension. To this end, we first conducted MR and found that lower SH2B3 expression increases circulating β2M levels (Fig. 1). Due to a lack of cis genetic variants for circulating β2M, we were unable to conduct MR to determine whether circulating β2M is causal for hypertension. We previously reported that Sh2b3−/− mice develop an exaggerated BP response and more severe end-organ damage (renal and vascular inflammation and dysfunction) in response to angiotensin II. We extend these findings in the present study by reporting that β2M expression is significantly increased in response to angiotensin II infusion in Sh2b3−/− but not wild type mice (Fig. 2). We thus provide evidence for a causal role of the SH2B3-β2M axis in hypertension.<SEP>To our knowledge, ours is the first study to demonstrate that SH2B3 might regulate hypertension not only via production of its coded protein, the lymphocyte adaptor protein (LNK), but also through effects on β2M expression. Deficiency of LNK increases interferon gamma producing CD8+ T-cells in the spleen and kidneys of hypertensive mice, and both interferon gamma and CD8+ T cells are mediators of hypertension. β2M is essential for MHC-I-mediated CD8+ T-cell activation. Our finding that loss of LNK increases β2M expression under hypertensive conditions is consistent with our MR results. We hypothesize that loss of SH2B3 and a resultant increase in β2M levels likely leads to increased CD8+ T cell activation and interferon gamma production, which promote hypertension and hypertensive end-organ damage (Fig. 1).<SEP>Our study has several strengths. First, the sample size was large and adequate to assess the relations of B2M to prevalent and incident hypertension. Second, BP and eGFR were meticulously ascertained, minimizing recall bias. Third, association results for prevalent and incident hypertension largely replicate those of an independent external study.<SEP>We acknowledge several study limitations. First, circulating β2M was only measured at the baseline examination, preventing analyses of temporal variation in plasma β2M. In addition, this was a European ancestry study sample; the extent to which our results are indicative of what would be observed in other racial/ethnic groups is unknown. Third, a substantial proportion of participants did not have measurement of urinary albumin, resulting in a smaller sample size for secondary longitudinal analyses that excluded those with CKD or albuminuria. Fourth, we applied an inclusive definition for hypertension that included elevated BP or antihypertensive medication use. Finally, we were unable to conduct MR of plasma β2M in relation to hypertension due to a lack of cis genetic variants for circulating β2M.<SEP>In summary, we have identified β2M to be cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with hypertension risk independent of albuminuria and kidney disease and provide functional evidence of a causal role of the SH2B3-β2M axis in hypertension. Future studies are needed to further understand the mechanistic role of β2M in hypertension and determine if there is therapeutic efficacy in targeting the SH2B3-β2M axis for hypertension treatment or prevention.<SEP>Perspectives<SEP>β2M is cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with hypertension in Framingham Heart Study participants with and without kidney dysfunction. Mendelian randomization analysis and studies using a murine model of hypertension provide evidence for a causal role of the SH2B3-β2M axis in blood pressure regulation. Future studies are needed to determine whether β2M is a clinically-useful prognostic indicator of hypertension and whether there is therapeutic utility in targeting the SH2B3-β2M axis for hypertension prevention and treatment.",19291,['OBWCCE']
22903727,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Several studies have demonstrated that maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation can reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in offspring by up to 70%. In addition, data from countries that have implemented mandatory folic acid fortification of the food supply (at about 0.2 mg/day) show a reduction in the prevalence of NTDs. However, food fortification programs currently in place are estimated to prevent only about 9 out of every 100 folic acid-preventable NTDs. Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms by which folate reduces the risk of NTDs could be informative for developing improved prevention strategies and reducing the global burden of NTDs.<SEP>Given the association between maternal folate status and NTD risk in offspring, recent studies of NTDs have mainly focused on candidate genes that are involved in folate-related pathways. However, a specific folate-related genetic variant has not been identified, even as a modest contributor to NTD risk. To more fully investigate the role of folate and folate-related genes as they relate to risk of NTDs, consideration should be given to the possibility that: 1) risk may be mediated via the maternal genotype rather than, or in addition to, the infant genotype, and 2) folate-related genes that contribute to risk of NTDs may do so via interactions with other genes and/or maternal folate status. However, few NTD studies have evaluated contributions from both maternal and infant genetic alleles and fewer still have considered allele-folate interactions. In this analysis, we investigated the hypotheses that risk of NTDs is associated with infant and/or maternal genotype for 31 allelic variants in five folate-related genes and those associations are modified by maternal folate intake.","METHODS<SEP>Study population<SEP>This study was based on data from a case-control study conducted in California, which has been described in detail elsewhere. Cases included live births, stillbirths (fetal deaths at > 20 weeks gestation), and terminations with NTDs (anencephaly and spina bifida) delivered of mothers who resided in Los Angeles, Santa Clara, and San Francisco counties, from July 1999 to June 2003. Spina bifida included cases of lipomyelomeningocele, meningomyelocele, and myelocystocele. For controls, the study included a random sample of live born infants with no major structural malformations, selected from approximately 600,000 live births in the 3 study counties. Potential cases were identified from medical records by the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program (CBDMP), using stringent multiple source and population-based ascertainment approaches as previously described. All cases were reviewed by a medical geneticist to determine whether they met inclusion criteria. Infants diagnosed with single-gene or chromosomal disorders (based on information gathered from medical records) were ineligible. Mothers who had preexisting type I or type II diabetes (5 cases, 1 control) or who reported using seizure medication in the periconceptional interval (1 case, 1 control) were excluded.<SEP>Maternal interviews<SEP>Mothers were eligible to participate if they were not incarcerated and if their primary language was either English or Spanish. Interviews were conducted using a standardized, computer-based questionnaire, primarily by telephone, in English or Spanish. Women were asked to report on exposures and behaviors occurring two months before through two months after conception (the periconceptional interval), which encompasses the critical period for neural tube development. The interview elicited information on a variety of variables, including sociodemographic factors, a detailed dietary assessment and periconceptional use of folic acid-containing supplements as well as multivitamins containing folic acid. Usual maternal nutrient intake from foods was assessed using a modified version of the National Cancer Institute’s Health Habits and History Questionnaire, a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire with demonstrated reliability and validity.<SEP>DNA collection<SEP>Previously collected DNA samples from cases and liveborn controls, as well as their mothers, were available from two sources: buccal brushes and dried newborn screening bloodspots. Samples for mothers of cases that were stillborn or terminated were collected by maternal buccal swab. DNA was not available for stillborn cases or cases that were terminated. Bloodspots were obtained both for infants when a buccal brush had not been acquired and for a subset of infants for whom buccal samples were also available. Bloodspot samples were selected via record matching between CBDMP and the California Genetic Disease Screening Program. Participants that had no DNA sample from either the mother or infant and/or inadequate maternal folate intake information were excluded from analyses (69 cases, 117 controls).<SEP>Genetic assays<SEP>Genomic DNA was extracted from dried bloodspots and buccal brushes using either protocol A (Puregene DNA Extraction Kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN)) or protocol B (NaOH extraction along with the QIAquick® Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)), depending upon sample type. All samples were quantified using the TaqMan® RNase P method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Genotyping of DNA from buccal brush samples was performed on purified, unamplified genomic DNA. Isolated genomic DNA from bloodspots was amplified using GenomiPhi™ multiple displacement amplification according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Sunnyvale, CA). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assayed using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and genotypes were read and discriminated on the ABI PRISM® 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Genotyping was duplicated for all buccal brush samples and for a 5% subset of bloodspot samples for quality control. Three SNPs were excluded in Hispanic infants and one in non-Hispanic White infants due to a genotyping failure rate greater than 20%.<SEP>SNP selection<SEP>SNPs selected for study included: 1) those previously reported to be associated with NTDs in humans, 2) those resulting in changes in amino acids with functional effects (predicted or known), 3) those with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) ≥ 0.05 in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic White populations, and 4) those with an available genotyping ABI SNP Assay-on-Demand. In total, 31 SNPs from five candidate genes were selected: DHFR (rs1650723, rs1677693, rs11951910); MTHFD1 (rs745686, rs8011839, rs1076991, rs1885031, rs1950902, rs2236224, rs2236225, rs3783728, rs11158542, rs11627387, rs11849530, rs34616731); MTHFR (rs1476413, rs1801131, rs1801133); SHMT (rs669340, rs1979277, rs2168781, rs2273026, rs9909104, rs12939757, rs12952556); and TYMS (rs502396, rs699517, rs1001761, rs2847153, rs2847149, rs2847326).<SEP>To determine whether the distribution of genotypes deviated from expected Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) frequencies, control mothers and infants were tested using a χ2 goodness-of-fit test for each race/ethnicity group. When there was evidence that the genotypes for a SNP were not in HWE (χ2 P value < 0.05) in a particular subgroup (e.g. Hispanic mothers), that subgroup was excluded from further analyses (Hispanic mothers (n=17 SNPs excluded); Hispanic infants (n=7 SNPs); non-Hispanic White mothers (n=3 SNPs) and non-Hispanic White infants from (n=7 SNPs).<SEP>The analytic subset was comprised of the 76% of cases and 80% of controls from the full study population that had both folate intake information as well as at least one DNA sample available. Of the 222 cases and 454 controls, there were 24 complete mother-infant case pairs and 186 mother-infant control pairs. The remaining observations available for our analytic subset were from infants only (97 cases, 233 controls) or mothers only (101 cases, 35 controls).<SEP>Statistical analyses<SEP>The association between NTD risk and genotype for each SNP, as well as interactions between each SNP genotype and maternal folate status, were evaluated using a linear (additive) risk model; this model assumes that the effect of the heterozygote genotype lies between the effects of the common and variant homozygote genotypes. The reference genotype in these estimations was chosen as the common homozygote. Given the relatively small number of mother-infant pairs with complete genotype data, these analyses were performed separately for the maternal and infant genotype. Race/ethnicity was included as a term in the models when data from both race/ethnicities were eligible for inclusion. Although not the main focus of this investigation, race/ethnicity and folate intake variables were included as main effects in all models based on their association with risk of NTDs.<SEP>Variables defining periconceptional use of folic acid-containing supplements (yes vs. no) and daily dietary maternal intake of folates (dietary folate equivalents) were combined to create a composite variable. Specifically, daily dietary intake in controls was used to establish quartiles of folate intake. The composite variable, “overall intake of folates,” was defined as “low” for women in the lowest quartile of maternal folate intakes (Q1 ≤ 309.49 μg/100g/day) or who did not take supplemental folic acid in the periconceptional period. All other combinations of folate intake (i.e. Q2, Q3 or Q4) and folic acid supplementation (i.e. yes/no) were defined as “high” for folate status.<SEP>Parameter estimates and their standard errors obtained from regression models were used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs). In addition, likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) comparing the full model (parameterized by maternal race/ethnicity, folate intake, genotype and the gene-folate cross term) and reduced models (parameter of interest is dropped from the full model) were used to test hypotheses regarding the significance of both interaction and main effects. If the interaction parameter LRT P value was ≥ 0.20, the interaction term was removed from the model and LRTs were carried out for main effects of genotype. The association between the genotype and NTD risk was considered to be significant when the LRT P value was < 0.05. Estimates from models with a significant interaction parameter have CIs calculated at 80%, corresponding to the 0.20 P value used to assess statistical significance; estimates from models with main effects alone have CIs calculated at 95%. For SNPs with significant interaction terms, “interaction effects” were calculated by exponentiating the sum of the gene, folate, and interaction beta coefficients. Since analyses employed the log-additive model, odds ratios represent the comparison between heterozygotes and common homozygotes; the square of this OR estimates the log risk in variant homozygotes compared to common homozygotes.","RESULTS<SEP>The characteristics of case and control infants and mothers are summarized in Table I. Case infants were more likely to be female than were control infants. Compared to non-Hispanic White mothers, Hispanic mothers were younger at delivery (mean age 27.0 vs. 31.8); however, maternal age at delivery was consistent across cases and controls within maternal race/ethnicity. Case mothers had fewer years of formal education than control mothers, as did Hispanic mothers compared to non-Hispanic White mothers. Maternal periconceptional use of folic acid supplements was higher in non-Hispanic Whites than in Hispanic mothers; differences in daily dietary intake of folate and the composite folate intake variable across these subgroups were more subtle.<SEP>Information for each SNP, (chromosome, rs ID, polymorphism type, general genic location, minor allele, genotyping failure rates, genotype distribution and results of testing for HWE in control mothers and infants) is summarized in Supplementary eTable I (See Supporting Information online).<SEP>Results from logistic regression models are summarized in Table II. There was no evidence of a nonrandom association (for main or interaction effects) between NTD-affected pregnancies and either maternal or infant variants in DHFR.<SEP>MTHFD1<SEP>An approximate 1.5-fold increase in risk was observed in infant MTHFD1 SNPs rs2236224 and rs2236225 for infants with the CT genotype in the lowest folate intake category compared to those with the CC genotype in the higher intake group (OR[int CC vs. CT] = 1.58, 80% CI: 0.99, 2.51 (LRT P = 0.07); OR[int CC vs. CT] = 1.53, 80% CI: 0.95, 2.47 (LRT P = 0.10), respectively; Table II). The infant AG genotype in MTHFD1 SNP rs11627387 appeared to be associated with a four-fold increase in NTD risk when there was low maternal folate intake compared to infants with the GG genotype and high maternal folate intake (OR[int GG vs. AG] = 4.25, 80% CI: 2.33, 7.75 (LRT P < 0.05)).<SEP>MTHFR<SEP>Mothers had a decreased risk of an NTD-affected pregnancy with low intake of folates and MTHFR SNPs rs1476413, rs1801131 and rs1801133 in heterozygous compared to common homozygous mothers in the high folate intake group (OR[int GG vs. AG] = 0.55, 80% CI: 0.20, 1.48 (LRT P = 0.15); OR[int AA vs. AC] = 0.58, 80% CI: 0.24, 1.43 (LRT P = 0.08); OR[int CC vs. CT] = 0.69, 80% CI: 0.41, 1.17 (LRT P = 0.03), respectively).<SEP>SHMT1<SEP>A maternal gene-only effect for SHMT1 SNP rs669340 CG appeared to be associated with a reduced risk of an NTD-affected pregnancy compared to mothers with the CC genotype (OR[CC vs. CG]= 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.96; (LRT P = 0.03), Table II). An interaction effect was observed for risk of NTDs in infants with the SHMT1 SNP rs12939757 AG genotype that were in the low folate intake group compared to infants with the AA genotype that were in the high folate intake group (OR[int AA vs. AG] = 2.01; 80% CI: 1.20, 3.37 (LRT P = 0.10)).<SEP>TYMS<SEP>The gene-folate interaction was associated with a reduced risk of NTDs for mothers in the low folate intake group with TYMS SNP rs502396 or rs699517 heterozygous genotype compared to the high folate intake group with the common homozygous genotype (OR[int TT vs. CT] = 0.91, 80% CI: 0.53, 1.56 (LRT P = 0.12); OR[int CC vs. CT] = 0.70, 80% CI: 0.38, 1.29 (LRT P = 0.19), Table II). The interaction effect in infants was also protective for risk for SNP rs2847153 (OR[int GG vs. AG] = 0.73, 80% CI: 0.37, 1.45 (LRT P = 0.14)).","DISCUSSION<SEP>In this study, 31 SNPs in five folate-related genes were evaluated to determine whether they were associated with the risk of NTDs. Both maternal and infant genotypes were evaluated for each SNP. These analyses provided modest evidence that ten SNPs in four genes were associated with the risk of NTDs via interactions with maternal folate status (MTHFD1, MTHFR, SHMT1, and TYMS), or via a gene-only association (n=1 SNP in SHMT1).<SEP>The MTHFD1 SNP rs2236225 (G1958A; R653Q) is a functional exonic SNP that has been studied in several populations. The maternal and infant genotypes that include the rs2236225 A allele have been associated with increased risk of NTDs (ORs = 1.5–1.8) in some, but not all studies. Although we did not identify an independent association between NTD risk and this variant, infant genotype for this variant and other MTHFD1 variants (rs2236224, rs2236225 and rs11627387) may be associated with NTD risk via an interaction with maternal folate status.<SEP>The metabolic basis for the association between NTD risk and rs2236225 is unknown, as the SNP does not appear to modify markers of folate status (e.g., plasma or red blood cell folate or plasma homocysteine levels). However, recent in vitro studies have shown that the MTHFD1 rs2236225 AA genotype 1) is associated with reduced enzymatic function, 2) can be functionally restored by the introduction of a folate analog, and 3) impairs de novo purine biosynthesis based on the metabolic activity of the enzyme as compared to wild type function.<SEP>The interaction effect for infant tagSNP rs11627387 was the largest detected in our study and suggested that infants with the AG genotype whose mothers had low overall intake of folates had 4 times the NTD risk than infants with the GG genotype whose mothers had high folate intake. Known and predicted effects of the intronic SNP rs11627387 do not suggest an etiologic mechanism underlying this novel finding, indicating that this SNP may be in linkage disequilibrium with the true disease-causing variant(s).<SEP>MTHFR encodes a key enzyme in the folate metabolic pathway and the thermolabile valine-containing isoform of this protein (C677T; A222V) has been extensively investigated with respect to NTD risk. However, there is very little evidence that indicates that maternal folate intake interacts with C677T to modify the risk of NTDs. One of the few prior investigations into the relationship between risk of NTDs and C677T-folate interactions did not find evidence of an interactive effect in a pre-fortification California population. In our post-fortification California study population (i.e. independent from the aforementioned California population), we identified three SNPs in the maternal MTHFR gene (rs1476413, rs1801131 (A1298C) and rs1801133 (C677T)) that interact with maternal folate intake to decrease the risk of NTDs.<SEP>Functional consequences of a common exonic SNP in SHMT1 (rs1979277 C allele) have been demonstrated in in vivo model systems whereby the nuclear import of SHMT1 is inhibited, potentially affecting de novo thymidylate biosynthesis. Association studies on NTDs and SHMT1 SNP rs1979277 (or SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with rs1979277), have shown conflicting results. We did not identify an association between this functional SNP and NTDs, either independently or through a folate interaction. Two other SNPs we evaluated suggested that SHMT1 may be a modifier of risk of NTDs: 1) a reduced risk was observed for mothers carrying the G allele at SNP rs669340; and 2) an increased risk of NTDs was observed through a folate-gene interaction for infant SNP rs12939757.<SEP>Functional studies of TYMS provide support for its role in the etiology of NTDs. Two common TYMS polymorphisms (a 28-bp tandem repeat in the promoter enhancer region (TSER) and a 6-bp deletion in the 3′-UTR) affect TYMS gene expression and enzyme levels. Two association studies on these TYMS polymorphisms and NTD risk have, however, provided conflicting results. The most recent association studies conducted on TYMS gene variants genotyped a limited number of SNPs. A 2-fold increase in risk of spina bifida in a California population was identified for the 3 infant TYMS SNPs rs2847149, rs1001761, and rs502396 in variant homozygotes compared to common homozygotes. In our study, the maternal TYMS SNP rs502396 (a tag SNP for rs2847149 and rs1001761) was associated with a decreased risk of NTDs, as was the maternal SNP rs699517 and the infant SNP rs2847153, through an interaction with low maternal folate intake.<SEP>NTDs have a multifactorial etiology, (i.e. genetic and environmentally mediated). Thus, it is necessary to consider both maternal effects and embryonic effects, as well as potential interactions between the two. The discrimination between maternal and offspring genetic effects relies on genotype information obtained from the mother and the infant so that both genotypes are included in the same statistical model. Given the small number of mother-infant pairs included in this study (24 case pairs) we were not able to model the genotypes simultaneously.<SEP>Many of the variants selected for this study had limited prior evidence for their role in the risk of NTDs, either as main effects or through a gene-folate interaction. Thus, some of the results represent a first effort to inform future studies of the etiology of NTDs. Notwithstanding our significant findings, the precision of the interaction estimates are low and must be cautiously interpreted, as some results may be due to spurious rather than true associations. Given our modest sample size, our power to detect interactions was limited. This was an expected limitation and was approached by selecting less stringent P values that were uncorrected for multiple testing. The flexibility in our criteria for statistical significance and acceptance of relatively high genotyping error rates, though less stringent, permitted us to utilize our study as a mechanism for informing future studies of NTDs.",20516,"['OBWCCE', 'VITMIN', 'EATBTS']"
19421404,"Introduction<SEP>The primary molecular defects in Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remain largely unknown, but it is widely recognized that both genetic and environmental risk factors have interacting roles in the pathogenesis and the progression of the disease. However, recent discoveries have led to a progress in the understanding of the molecular genetic background of T2D brought forward by genome-wide association (GWA) studies which have dramatically increased the number of validated type 2 diabetes loci with modest impact on relative diabetes risk. Several loci of interest may be located in the region of human chromosone 1q21–24 which shows replicated linkage to T2D in at least eight populations including North European Caucasian families, Pima Indians and Old Order Amish. Furthermore, linkage analysis has also provided evidence for linkage of the metabolic syndrome (central obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension) to 1q23–31. These regions as well as other closely related regions of chromosome 1 are under intense search for identification of T2D susceptibility genes.<SEP>Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3LI) encoding the inflammatory glycoprotein YKL-40 is located in a phylogenetically highly conserved area on chromosome 1q32.1. YKL-40 is involved in inflammatory processes and extracellular matrix remodelling including angiogenesis and functions as a growth factor for several cell types. Studies have shown, that patients with T2D have elevated plasma YKL-40 levels which correlate with insulin resistance and with their diabetic lipid profile, but not with estimates of glycemic regulation. Also patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have elevated YKL-40 levels which increase with increasing levels of albuminuria.<SEP>The CHI3LI promotor variant −329 G/A (rs10399931) associates with the inter-individual plasma YKL-40 levels in patients with sarcoidosis. Furthermore, the functional CHI3LI promotor SNP −131C→G (rs4950928) increases the mRNA transcript levels coding for the YKL-40 protein in a genome wide study of gene expression in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells from children with asthma and is shown to be predictive of asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reduced lung function. Since CHI3LI is a susceptibility gene for asthma with elevated circulating YKL-40 levels as a biomarker, it is possible that one of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or another gene variation with which they could be in tight linkage disequilibrium with may be functional in relation to T2D.<SEP>Applying a HapMap–based tgSNP approach the objective of the present study was to investigate the putative association of common variation in the CHI3LI locus with T2D, obesity and several T2D associated quantitative traits.","Methods<SEP>Ethics Statement<SEP>Informed written consent was obtained from all participants before participation. The study was approved by the Ethical Committees of Copenhagen and Aarhus and was in accordance with the principle of the Helsinki Declaration II.<SEP>Study population<SEP>A total of 11 tgSNPs (including the rs10399931 and rs4950928) covering all haplotype blocks in CHI3LI locus was genotyped. Genotyping was performed in 9438 individuals including Inter99, a population-based sample of unrelated, middle-aged Danish individuals living in the greater Copenhagen area, and 2924 individuals recruited from the outpatient clinic at Steno Diabetes Center.<SEP>The Inter99 study population has been described in detail previously. In brief, both participants from the Inter99 cohort and individuals recruited from the outpatient clinic were characterized by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Impaired glucose homeostasis (IFG, IGT and diabetes) was defined according to WHO criteria after a 75 g OGTT giving a classification of normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n = 5302), impaired fasting glycemia (IFG; n = 540), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n = 830) or screen-detected untreated T2D (SDU DM; n = 294). Missing data was seen in 421 individuals (4.5%) and a total of 2091 individuals had known T2D. The participants were investigated for an association between genotype and quantitative metabolic traits; individuals with known type 2 diabetes were excluded from these analyses. All participants were of Danish nationality.<SEP>Biochemical and anthropometric measurements<SEP>Height and body weight were measured in light indoor clothes and without shoes, and BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by (height (m))2. Waist circumference was measured in the standing position midway between the iliac crest and the lower costal margin and hip circumference at its maximum.<SEP>In both Inter99- and Steno Diabetes Center participants, blood samples were drawn in the fasting state after a 12-h overnight fast. Plasma glucose was analysed by a glucose oxidase method (Granutest, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). HbA1C was measured by ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (normal reference range: 4.1–6.4%) and serum insulin (excluding des(31, 32) and intact proinsulin) was measured using the AutoDELFIA insulin kit (Perkin-Elmer/Wallac, Turku, Finland). Serum C-peptide concentrations were measured by a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (AutoDELFIA C-peptide kit; Perkin-Elmer/Wallac, Turku, Finland).<SEP>Serum triglyceride and total and HDL-cholesterol were analysed using enzymatic colorimetric methods (GPO-PAP and CHOD-PAP, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). HOMA-IR was calculated as fasting plasma glucose [mmol/l] multiplied by fasting serum insulin [pmol/l] and divided by 22.5. Insulinogenic index at 30 min was calculated as fasting serum insulin subtracted from plasma insulin at 30 min [pmol/l] divided by plasma glucose at 30 min [mmol/l].<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>SNPs in a region 22 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream of CHI3LI were chosen from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org). Haplotype tgSNPs were selected from the HapMap data using TAGGER. TAGGER was used with a 5% MAF cut off, agressive tagging (r2>0.8). Two haplotype blocks with 2 and 5 SNPs, respectively, and with similar structures in both patients with T2D and in controls were identified (Figure 1). The other tgSNPs were not included in the haplotype block analyses since they were not part of any block. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan allelic discrimination (Kbioscience, Herts, UK) with a success rate >97.0%. Discordance was 0% as judged from re-genotyping of 965 random duplicate samples. Genotype distribution obeyed Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), all p>0.25.<SEP>Statistical analyses<SEP>Logistic regression analyses were used to analyse differences in allele and genotype frequencies between case and control subjects; analyses were adjusted for age, sex and BMI where appropriate. The statistical analyses were performed using RGui version 2.5.0 (available at http://www.r-project.org). The haplotype block analyses were analysed for an association with T2D after adjustment for age, sex and BMI. Haplotype analyses were performed using PLINK. P-values are not adjusted for multiple testing.","Results<SEP>Clinical characteristics for the Inter99 cohort and the individuals recruited at Steno Diabetes Center are presented in Table 1. A total of 2345 T2D patients and 5302 individuals with a normal glucose tolerance test were identified.<SEP>Overall we found no association of rs10399931, rs4950928 or any of the other tgSNPs of CHI3LI with T2D after adjustment for age, sex, BMI and glucose tolerance, all p>0.25 (Table 2). In similar analyses, none of the tgSNPs were associated with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), although a borderline protective association with IGT was detected for rs12123883 (Table S1 and S2).<SEP> Table 3 and 4 show the multiadjusted association of rs10399931 and rs4950928 with BMI and other T2D related quantitative traits among NGT, IFG, IGT and screen-detected untreated T2D in Inter99 and Steno Diabetes Center collected individuals. We found a significant association between rs10399931 and the serum C-peptide concentration after 2 hours, p = 0.03, but in all we found no significant association between rs10399931 or rs4950928 and any of the T2D quantitative traits. Similarly, none of the other SNPs showed any associations (data not shown).<SEP>The two identified haplotype blocks of CHI3LI did not show any association with T2D (Table 5).","Discussion<SEP>This is a large-scale and to our knowledge the first study of variation in CHI3LI in relation to T2D and pre-diabetic quantitative traits. CHI3LI encodes the inflammatory protein YKL-40 which previously has been found to be elevated in plasma from patients with T2D and from patients with T1D where it also correlates with increasing levels of albuminuria. In our study, we have exmained 11 tgSNPs covering the common variation (MAF>5%) in CHI3LI including the SNPs rs10399931 and rs4950928 which previously have been found to contribute to interindividual variations in circulating YKL-40 levels in patients with sarcoidosis and asthma, respectively. Furthermore, CHI3LI has been found to be a susceptibility gene for asthma, since rs4950928 is predictive of asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reduced lung function.<SEP>A total of 9438 individuals have been examined, but no significant association of rs10399931, rs4950928 or any of the other tgSNPs of CHI3LI were found with T2D or any of the intermediate T2D related quantitative traits. A borderline protective association with IGT was detected for rs12123883, but rs12123883 is a rare SNP with only few homozygotes and the protective association is most likely a chance finding. Furthermore, the p-value would not withstand correction for multiple testing considering the number of tests performed. On the same line, none of the two identified haplotype blocks showed any association with T2D.<SEP>In association analyses of rs10399931 and SNPs analysed in the DGI genome wide association scan study, rs10399931 is in LD with rs4950929 (r2 = 0.74) and rs946263 (r2 = 0.78). Other correlations had r2-values<0.05. In the DGI genome wide association scan study, no significant associations of rs4950929 with any of the type 2 diabetic phenotypic traits were found, but the rs946263 G-allele was nominally found to be associated with T2D (p = 0.027). rs946263, which is a synonymous SNP located −9639 base pairs from the translational start site in CHI3LI, is also in perfect LD (r2 = 1.0) with rs4950928, which accounts for approximately 10% of the variance in plasma YKL-40 levels in asthma patients. Beside the LD of rs10399931 and rs4950928 with rs946263, none of the examined SNPs or haplotype blocks of CHI3LI seem to be of any significance for the T2D diagnosis or any of the T2D related quantitative traits. Since the encoded inflammatory protein, YKL-40, of CHI3LI seems to be both a marker of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction it is possible that it is the endothelial dysfunction and the later micro- and macrovascular complications of T2D that accounts for the elevated YKL-40 levels in T2D patients. In endothelial dysfunction, elevated YKL-40 levels seem to play a role in relation to cell migration, reorganization and tissue remodelling as a response to endothelial damage.<SEP>The possible assocation between YKL-40 and vascular damage is supported by the finding of an independent association between elevated circulating YKL-40 levels and increasing levels of albuminuria in T1D patients. Elevated plasma YKL-40 is also found to be associated with the presence and extent of coronary artery disease as assessed by coronary angiography and just recently, YKL-40 levels have been found to be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction. Furthermore, increasing YKL-40 levels do predict cardiovascular mortality in individuals without known DM or CHD after adjustment for known CV risk factors and markers.<SEP>Substantial evidence supports the notion that endothelial dysfunction and low-grade inflammation play a major pathophysiological role in the development of insulin resistance and the progression to manifest T2D. We have previously shown, that YKL-40 levels are elevated in patients with T2D where it correlates with insulin resistance as assessed by the HOMA model and with levels of triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids. Since we found no association of any of the tgSNPs and surrogate markers of insulin resistance or the diabetic lipid profile in the present study, it does not seem to be any of these tgSNPs that explain the previously found correlation with these variables.<SEP>Multiple genes on different chromosomes may influence inflammatory biomarker levels and may have a potential role in the development of insulin resistance through a low-grade inflammatory state. In proximity of the YKL-40 encoding gene, locus 1q32.2 has been documented to influence the plasma levels of ICAM-1, an adhesion molecule well-documented to participate in endothelial dysfunction and the development of T2D. However, association studies between YKL-40 and ICAM-1, either at protein or transcript levels, have not been conducted. Neither have association studies of variations of CHI3L1 in relation to micro- or macrovascular conditions never been made.<SEP>In conclusion, both rs10399931 and rs4950928 are in high LD with rs946263 which is reported to associate with phenotypic traits of T2D in DGI. However, neither rs1039991 nor rs4950928 nor any other tgSNPs of CHI3LI which were investigated in the present study are associated with T2D or T2D related quantitative traits including estimates of insulin resistance and dysregulated glucose homeostasis in the examined approximately 9500 Danes. Further studies are required to determine YKL-40 levels as a marker of inflammation in the prediabetic state and the role of CHI3LI in the pathogenesis of T2D.",13893,['OBWCCE']
26354764,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Current treatment options available for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are limited to antiangiogenic treatments to improve visual outcomes in persons with neovascular AMD and to the use of high dose antioxidant supplements, to slow the progression of intermediate to advanced disease. The results of the Age-Related Eye Disease Studies demonstrated that the disease process can be impacted by nutritional interventions.  However, the benefits or safety of using high dose antioxidants for long periods of time, as might be needed to prevent AMD or slow progression in the early stages has not been established. <SEP>A large body of scientific evidence indicates that healthy lifestyle modifications can lower processes thought to promote AMD including oxidative stress, inflammation, blood lipoprotein disturbances and hypertension. Consistent with this, healthy diets  not smoking  and physical activity  have been previously associated with lower occurrence of early and/or advanced AMD in epidemiological studies. The magnitude of risk reduction associated with several healthy lifestyles, considered jointly, may be greater than the magnitude associated with individual healthy lifestyles, as suggested by results of a previous study in the Carotenoids in Age-Related Eye Disease Study (CAREDS) that indicated that women (50–74 years of age) who had a combination of healthy lifestyles (healthy diets, physical activity and not smoking) had a 3-fold lower odds for early AMD, relative to women who had unhealthy lifestyles.<SEP>Genetic risk might modify the benefit of healthy lifestyles. Strong genetic risk factors for AMD include advanced age and certain genetic variants. In particular, the Y402H (rs1061170) variant within the complement factor H gene (CFH) and the A69S (rs10490924) variant within the age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) locus consistently confer the greatest risk for both early and late AMD in people of European ancestry; increasing risk 1.5 to 3 fold with each additional risk allele for early and late AMD, respectively. Additional complement pathway genes are well characterized for increasing risk for late AMD, including complement component 3 (C3), complement factor I (CFI), and a locus between complement component 2 and complement factor B (C2/CFB) (previously reviewed), but the effect sizes for variants within these genes are greatly attenuated for risk of early AMD.<SEP>Genetic risk for AMD has also been observed to amplify the risk for AMD associated with several specific healthy lifestyles or phenotypes in some previous studies,  but not others.  No previous studies have evaluated associations of joint markers of several different healthy lifestyles, together, with AMD risk genotypes. In the present report, we investigate the interactions between genetic risk for AMD and a healthy lifestyle score, summing three lifestyles (diet, smoking and physical activity histories) on the prevalence of AMD, in a study sample (CAREDS) in which AMD cases were mostly comprised of early stages and assessed six years after assessment of lifestyle exposures. Two main strategies were employed to evaluate interactions between lifestyle and genetic risk factors. One strategy was to compute a synergy index to determine whether the burden of AMD risk attributable to genetic and lifestyles, together, was more than the sum of the risk of each individually. This is also considered to be evidence of biological synergy which might be expected if lifestyle and genetic factors both contribute to the same biological mechanism for AMD pathology, such as to promote inflammation. A second, more stringent, strategy was employed to determine whether genetic risk factors might multiply the magnitude of AMD risks associated with healthy lifestyles, assessing by the p-value for multiplicative interactions. Evidence of multiplicative interactions might supply stronger evidence to conclude that recommendations to patients for personalized preventive interventions customized to their specific genetic risk profiles might be warranted.<SEP>We also explore the extent to which these joint associations were explained by measures of LZ status in the diet, blood or retina uniquely available in this cohort. LZ and isomers uniquely accumulate in the macula of the retina where they comprise macular pigment and may protect the macula by absorbing potentially damaging blue light, in addition to the actions of these carotenoids on lowering oxidative stress and inflammation(recently reviewed) Higher levels of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin (LZ) in the diet, serum and/or retina, appear to be influenced not only by levels of these carotenoids in the diet, but also by other aspects of healthy diets, lifestyles and genetic factors,  which might work jointly to lower AMD risk. A recent report provides evidence that lutein intake only lowers risk of AMD incidence among persons with two or more risk alleles from common CFH and ARMS2 variants.","METHODS<SEP>Study Sample<SEP>CAREDS is a previously described ancillary study of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study (OS). The primary goal of CAREDS was to examine associations between LZ status in women 50–79 years of age to the prevalence of age-related eye diseases, including AMD, an average of six years later. Fifty percent of all women participating in the OS study centers in Madison, WI (n=694), Iowa City, IA (n=631), and Portland, OR (n=680) were recruited, targeting women reporting the lowest (<28th percentile) and highest (>78th percentile) LZ intakes at WHI baseline. Women in CAREDS did not differ significantly from WHI women with intakes of LZ between the 28th and 78th percentile in terms of numerous known or suspected AMD risk factors; including age, education, body mass index, smoking, use of supplements or hormone therapy, and history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease (data not shown).<SEP>CAREDS study visits were conducted from 2001–2004 in 2,005 women and have been previously described. Briefly, visits included obtaining stereoscopic fundus photographs which were graded for prevalent AMD classification. CAREDS study visits also measured the optical density of macular pigment via customized heterochromatic flicker photometer, questionnaires to assess health history, supplement use, and sunlight exposure history. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were used to estimate usual dietary intakes at WHI_OS baseline (six years prior to CAREDS study visits (1994–1998)) and recalled for intakes 15-years prior to CAREDS study visits.  WHI-OS study visits also included, collection and storage of blood samples, smoking history, physical activity, blood pressure, and anthropometrics. The stored blood samples have been accessed for genotyping and measurement of serum carotenoids, among other biomarkers. Therefore exposure assessment was antecedent to outcome assessment. Of the original 2,005 CAREDS participants, 1,857 had gradable fundus photographs available for AMD classification and 1,663 of these also had genetic data available for the present analysis. All CAREDS and WHI-OS procedures conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki, informed consent was obtained from all participants, and approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board at each University.<SEP>As previously described, data in CAREDS suggest fluctuations in the amount of LZ consumed at the time of WHI enrollment (six years prior to ocular photography) and in the time prior to enrollment in the WHI. Thus, to avoid bias resulting from including women with fluctuating diets just prior to exposure assessment, we conducted analysis in the full sample, and then after excluding women whose intakes of LZ changed more than 1 quintile categorization between the 1988–1992 (CAREDS 15-year recall FFQ) and 1994–1998 (WHI baseline FFQ) (n=356, 18%) and those who were candidates for recent diet change due to diagnoses of the following comorbid conditions for which diet changes are often recommended: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, macular degeneration, and/or a history of hypertension (n=579, 29%). The subsample for these analyses included 728 women with stable diets.<SEP>AMD Classification<SEP>Stereoscopic fundus photographs were graded by the University of Wisconsin Fundus Photograph Reading Center using the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) protocol for grading maculopathy. For the present analysis, women were classified as having AMD if they had photographic evidence of either early or late stages of AMD. Early AMD was classified in part using criteria for AREDS category 3. This included the presence of one or more large drusen (≥125 microns) or extensive intermediate drusen (total area ≥360 microns when soft indistinct drusen were present or ≥650 microns when soft indistinct drusen were absent). Additional criteria for early AMD included having pigmentary abnormalities; an increase or decrease in pigmentation if accompanied by at least one druse ≥63 microns. Late AMD included geographic atrophy, neovascularization, or exudation in the center subfield. The reference group included women who had neither early nor late AMD; generally corresponding to AREDS categories 1 and 2.<SEP>Healthy Lifestyle Score<SEP>The healthy lifestyle score (HLS) is a 6-point variable which gives equal weight to each of three, 3-level health habits queried at WHI baseline: diet assessed by a modified 2005 Healthy Eating Index (lowest 20%, 21%-80%, and highest 20%), physical activity measured in MET hours per week (lowest, second, and third tertile), and pack years of smoking (never, ≤7 pack/years >7 pack/years). Details of the HLS development and distribution can be found elsewhere. For current analyses, HLS was classified into a three level variable based on composite HLS scores of 0–2, 3, and 4–6, which divided the sample into approximate tertiles.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>Genotyping for known and candidate AMD genes was done at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH) using a custom Illumina GoldenGate Assay. DNA was extracted from the buffy coats of blood obtained at WHI-OS baseline examinations (1994–1998) that have been stored frozen at −80°C. Genotype calls were made using Illumina Genome Studio. SNPs not designable to the custom Illumina assay, CFH Y402H being one, were genotyped using the KASP Assay at LCG Genomics (Teddington, United Kingdom). Standard quality control (QC) filters were applied, resulting in exclusions of SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) χ2 P-value <1.0×10−6, MAF <0.01, or genotype call rates <95%.<SEP>For individuals with an insufficient quantity of DNA for KASP genotyping after Illumina genotyping (n=53 of the total CAREDS sample), CFH Y402H genotypes were imputed in MACH (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html) using the available chromosome 1 SNPs from Illumina (14 SNPs) and the 1000 Genomes Project European ancestry panel (CEU) as a reference. The resulting R2 from Y402H imputation was 99.5%.<SEP>For the present analyses, genetic risk for AMD was defined by individual Y402H (CFH) or rs10490924 (A69S ARMS2) genotypes; two SNPs established to increase risk for both early and late AMD. Data was also available to explore joint effects for SNPs more strongly associated with late AMD: rs2230199 (C3), rs10033900 (CFI), and rs641153 (C2/CFB).<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>Models were fit to estimate the joint effects of each genotype and HLS. Interactions were assessed on multiplicative and additive scales. Deviations from multiplicative interactions were tested based on the Wald test statistic for the interaction term in logistic regression models. This is a commonly used test for statistical interaction on a multiplicative scale as it tests whether the relative effect of an exposure of interest is constant across strata of another factor of interest. A p-value for interaction less than 0.05 was considered suggestive. Deviations from additive interactions (i.e., two factors combine to be more or less than the sum of their individual effects) were tested using the Synergy Index (SI) and corresponding 95% CIs. When estimating the SI, it has been recommended to recode protective factors so “exposure” indicates risk and the joint effects stratum with the lowest risk is the reference group. Therefore, the joint reference group was women with low genetic risk and high HLS score (4–6). An SI=1.0 indicates no interaction (i.e., the factors combine in a manner that is exactly additive), SI>1.0 indicates the two factors considered together combine to be more than the sum of their individual effects (i.e., biological synergism), and SI<1.0 indicates negative additive interaction, or that the effects of the two factors combine to be less than the sum of the individual effects. Because of small cell sizes when conducting joint analyses, a dominant genetic model was assumed for A69S (ARMS2) and rs641153 (CFB/C2). An additive genetic model was assumed for all other SNPs. Interaction analyses were adjusted for age. Additional adjustments for other risk factors previously identified to influence odds of AMD in CAREDS were tested including blue iris color, and current hormone therapy use. Smoking, diet, or physical activity, were not additionally adjusted for because these variables are included within the healthy lifestyle score itself.<SEP>Data management and statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC).","RESULTS<SEP>There were 337 cases of AMD in the full sample, of which 91% were early stages of AMD. After adjusting for age, 23% of women with low HLS scores (0–2) had AMD, compared to 19% of women with high scores (4–6) (P=0.13). Limiting the sample to those with stable diets resulted in 120 cases of AMD. 20% of women with low HLS had AMD compared to 16% of women with high HLS in this diet stable subsample (P=0.14). The distribution of AMD risk phenotypes by HLS score levels is given in Table 1. There were no differences in genotype distributions by HLS classification (Table 1). Limiting the sample to women with stable diets (n=728) kept risk factor differences stable across HLS strata, except that the higher HLS scores among older women did not persist in the subgroup limited to stable diets.<SEP>Main Effects of AMD Genotypes in CAREDS<SEP>Odds for AMD increased with each additional copy of the risk Y402H CFH risk allele: women with two risk alleles had 2.4 times greater odds of AMD relative to women with zero risk alleles (P<0.0001) (Table 2). Odds for AMD also increased with each additional copy of the A69S risk allele; women with two copies had 2.2 times greater odds of AMD relative to women with zero copies of the risk allele (P=0.0001). Homozygosity for the G allele of rs641153 (CFB/C2) was associated with increased odds of AMD (P=0.02). No main effect of rs10033900 (CFI) nor rs2230199 (C3) was observed within CAREDS. Similar trends were observed in the subsample of women with stable diets.<SEP>Interactions between CFH Genotype and Healthy Lifestyle Score<SEP>In the full sample, the odds for AMD was 3.3 times greater in women who had both two high risk CFH alleles (CC) and low HLS, relative to low risk genotype (TT) and high HLS (OR=3.3, 95% CI: 1.80–6.05) (Table 3a). The joint effect of these two factors was the same as the sum of their individual effects (SI=1.08, 95% CI: 0.70–1.67). There was no evidence for multiplicative interaction (Pinteraction=0.94).<SEP>In the subsample of women with stable diets, the odds for AMD associated with having both poor lifestyle score and the high-risk CFH genotype was 4.6 times greater compared to women with healthy lifestyle and low-risk genotype (OR=4.63, 95% CI: 1.85–11.60; Table 3b). The joint effect of these two factors in this subsample was more than the sum of their individual effects, implying synergy (SI=1.34, 95% CI: 1.05–1.70). The greatest increase in odds for AMD associated with poor lifestyle scores was among women with high genetic risk. In women with the high-risk CFH genotype (CC), the odds of AMD were 3 times higher for those with the lowest HLS (0–2) relative to those with highest HLS (4–6) (OR=4.63 vs. 1.56, Ptrend across HLS groups within genotype class=0.04; Table 3b). We explored whether better status for LZ among women with high versus low HLS explained the association between HLS and AMD in women with the high risk CC genotype. Indeed, the ORs for AMD comparing high versus low HLS in those with highest genetic risk were attenuated by 30, 9, and 15% when adjusting for LZ in the diet, serum and MPOD (respectively), suggesting that better status for LZ could partially explain these associations between HLS and AMD. The joint effects of CFH genotype and dietary LZ intake similarly suggest at least additive effects of these two risk factors for AMD (Tables 4a and 4b; available at http://aaojournal.org).<SEP>We also explored whether higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids explained the association between HLS and AMD in women with the high risk CC genotype. OR and interaction terms were not influenced at all by this adjustment (data not shown.)<SEP>Interactions between ARMS2 Genotype and Healthy Lifestyle Score<SEP>The joint effect of poor lifestyle and ARMS2 risk alleles was difficult to discern due to low sample sizes after cross-classification, only 18 individuals had both two A69S risk alleles and HLS between 0–2. Individuals with one or two A69S risk alleles were combined for subsequent analyses. In the full sample, the odds for AMD was 2 times greater in women who had at least one ARMS2 risk allele and low HLS, relative to zero risk alleles and high HLS (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.29–3.02; Table 3a). The synergy index suggests non-significant, sub-additive joint effects of ARMS2 genetic risk and poor lifestyle (SI=0.9, 95% CI: 0.27–2.93). There was no evidence for a multiplicative interaction (Pinteraction=0.63). In the subsample of women with stable diets, the odds for AMD for women with both risk factors, relative to neither, was 1.75 (95% CI: 0.92–3.30; Table 3b). The synergy index was statistically significant for more than additive effects in this reduced sample (SI=1.65, 95% CI: 1.18–2.30). However, the SI is dependent on the reference group having the lowest odds for disease, which is not the case in this subsample (lowest odds was among women of low genetic risk and HLS=3, OR=0.67). Considering the totality of evidence presented here, there is no evidence to suggest deviations from either additive or multiplicative effects of ARMS2 genotype and healthy lifestyles.<SEP>Interactions between Other AMD Risk Genotypes and Healthy Lifestyle Score<SEP>Joint effects of lifestyle score and variants in additional complement pathway genes (CFB/C2, C3 rs2230199 and CFI rs10033900) were also explored (Tables 5a and 5b; available at http://aaojournal.org). Absent main effects for SNPs in C3 and CFI (Table 2), along with a variable combination of genotype and HLS lending towards the lowest odds for AMD, resulted in unreliable estimates of synergy for these genotypes and HLS.","DISCUSSION<SEP>In the present study, a low score for a combination of healthy lifestyles was observed to have added to odds for AMD associated with having high risk CFH risk alleles. In women who had maintained stable diets, we also observed the first evidence of potential biological synergy (significant Synergy Index) between CFH risk genotype and poor status for a broad lifestyle measure (including poor diet, low physical activity, and smoking). It thus appears that the attributable risk of AMD may be inordinately greater in women who have both high risk CFH genotype and these lifestyle characteristics. The majority (91%) of AMD cases in the present report were in the early stages (large drusen or worse).<SEP>Public health interventions targeting such individuals might show great promise in lowering the number of people who have early AMD, potentially preventing or delaying the onset of advanced AMD. Given that there was no evidence of multiplicative interactions, the potential benefit of healthy lifestyles in lowering AMD risk may apply across women of different genotypes, so genotyping to identify persons at high risk may not be clinically necessary. Overall, these data should encourage physicians to recommend adoption of healthy lifestyles at early ages in people who have a family history of AMD, and may motivate patients to follow such recommendations. While benefit has yet to be proven in clinical trials, a large body of evidence, including data from clinical trials, suggests that these lifestyle changes lower blood pressure, oxidative stress and inflammation  which are thought to promote AMD and are associated with lower risk for a large number of chronic diseases. Given a lack of evidence that high dose antioxidant supplements prevent AMD, and the unknown safety of consuming high dose antioxidants for long periods of time , these data suggest that any success in physicians’ attempts to persuade these patients to adopt healthy lifestyles at early ages could ultimately benefit those patients significantly.<SEP>The suggestive synergistic relationship between CFH genotype and healthy lifestyles may reflect common influences on inflammation. The risk variant of Y402H is known to contribute to uncontrolled and defective regulation of the alternative complement pathway, leading to sustained inflammatory reactions, and ultimately increased risk for AMD (reviewed). Individual factors comprising the HLS (broadly healthy diets, physical activity, and absence of smoking) are also known to be associated with reduced inflammation.<SEP>The combined influence of poor lifestyles and genetic risk was, in part, explained by low LZ intake in the present study. This is despite the fact that we observed no significant interactions between lutein intake and CFH risk (Supplemental Tables 4A and 4B) or between lutein intake and combined risk alleles for CFH and ARMS2 genes (data not shown). The power to detect significant interactions between lutein intake and genotype in AMD risk was lower relative to previous prospective studies in the Rotterdam Study and a pooled analysis of the Rotterdam and Blue Mountain Eye Studies, indicating interactions between LZ intake and high risk CFH and/or ARMS2 genotypes for early AMD. The combined results from the present study and these two studies supports an augmentation of AMD genetic risk associated with lutein intake. Consistent with this, lutein has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties and supplementation lowers circulating complement factor levels. Within the sample used for this analysis, and in the overall CAREDS cohort, higher HLS and dietary LZ intake were each associated with lower serum C-reactive protein, a systemic marker of inflammation, and higher vitamin D, also related to inflammatory conditions. Protective associations between serum vitamin D, which also has anti-inflammatory properties, and AMD in women with a CC Y402H genotype in this sample are described in a separate manuscript.<SEP>If AMD protection by healthy lifestyles, was directly through regulation of the complement pathway, one might hypothesize consistent synergy with other complement pathway genes known to influence AMD risk such as C3, C2/CFB, and CFI. We did not observe joint effects for these SNPs consistent with that observed with Y402H. This lack of consistency may be due to differential power to detect associations across SNPs with varying minor allele frequency, differential impact of genes on early versus late stages of AMD, or small or non-existent main effects of these SNPs within the broader CAREDS cohort. Similar analyses in large study samples with more cases of late AMD would provide further insight.<SEP>The results of the present study cannot be extended to supplemental intake of dietary antioxidants or other nutrients. In the present study, too few women (17%) reported using high dose supplements for more than 5 years before AMD was assessed to permit adequate statistical power to evaluate these associations by genotype. Although some post hoc analyses of AREDS data suggest multiplicative interactions between high dose antioxidant supplements and AMD risk genotype in people with intermediate or worse AMD, these results have not been replicated. While the current evidence is not strong enough to justify recommendations for supplements or lifestyles to lower AMD risk which is tailored to genetic profiles, results of these five studies, combined with the work presented here, highlight the fact that the individual-level benefit of diet, lifestyle, and/or supplements cannot be extrapolated from average estimates of benefit in study groups, who also differ in many respects relative to the larger population of people at risk for AMD.<SEP>Limitations to the evidence provided by the present study are as follows. The AMD outcome, although assessed six years later than exposure estimate, was a prevalence estimate. Some cases of AMD may have developed prior to the exposure assessment. Fluctuations in diet (and health behaviors) in the time prior to AMD assessment may not reflect long-term intake, leading to random or non-random error in effect estimates on AMD risk. However, 72% of women determined to have AMD (primarily large drusen) by photography had not previously been told they had AMD. To avoid this potential bias, we conducted analysis in the full dataset and then excluding women whose diets changed in a time period prior to WHI, or who were diagnosed with a chronic disease for which diet changes are often recommended (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, macular degeneration, and/or a history of hypertension). While minimizing bias, this approach reduces statistical power. Therefore results have been presented for the full sample (which may include bias) and the reduced sample (which minimized bias but reduced power). Second, the estimated lower risk for AMD associated with healthy lifestyles in this study may apply primarily to lowering risk for early stages of AMD; the majority of women with AMD in this study had early/intermediate stage (large drusen or worse). Confirmation of these results is needed in larger, long-term population-based studies of newly developed AMD and progression of AMD to more advanced stages.<SEP>Overall, our study results are consistent with previous research suggesting diets and lifestyles which limit oxidative stress and inflammation are protective against early AMD, and this may be most important for reducing AMD risk in individuals at high genetic risk. This suggests interventions to consume plant-rich, high-lutein diets, reduce smoking, and encourage physical activity, are reasonable strategies for AMD prevention, particularly in groups of people who are at high genetic risk and/or have a family history for AMD. Confirmation of results in prospective studies and in a greater number of samples including men and other ethnicities are needed.",27121,['OBWCCE']
32722627,"1. Introduction<SEP>The incidence rate and prevalence of type 2 diabetes have steadily increased in Asian populations. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that 163 million people (35.2% of global diabetic population) in the Western Pacific region had prevalent type 2 diabetes in 2019, contributing the most to type 2 diabetes in the world. In Korea, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased from 6.9% in 1998 to 10.8% in 2017. Additionally, type 2 diabetes contributed to 17.1% of the total deaths in Korea in 2018.<SEP>Coffee consumption has been suggested to lower several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, liver disorders, and several types of cancers. The bioactive compounds in coffee, such as caffeine and chlorogenic acids, have been investigated as potential compounds that lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. Caffeine has been shown to stimulate the metabolic rate, and its thermogenic effect has been hypothesized to decrease the risk of metabolic disease development. Antioxidants, including chlorogenic acids, commonly found in coffee, have also been highlighted as a preventing factor for type 2 diabetes by inhibiting the generation of free radicals and removing hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress.<SEP>A heritability study on caffeine and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have suggested that coffee consumption behavior may be linked to genetic polymorphisms. The first genome-wide meta-analysis of coffee consumption was conducted in a European population and identified two independent loci, rs4410790 nears AHR and rs2470893 between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, which are caffeine metabolism-related genes. Additional European/Caucasian GWASs also discovered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in AHR, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 as well as ABCG2, POR, BDNF, SLC6A4, GCKR and MLXIPL, near NRCAM or ULK3. A Japanese GWAS, the first GWAS of coffee consumption in Asia, identified 24 SNPs on chromosome 12, showing rs2074356 in HECTD4 as the strongest significant SNP. Another Japanese GWAS found two loci located in CUX2 (rs7910258) and AHR (rs10251701). The few GWASs in Asia warrant further investigation of the coffee-related genetic polymorphisms in Asian populations because there has been an increase in coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes in Asia. Because coffee consumption has the potential to prevent type 2 diabetes, it is important to investigate whether coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and whether this association is modified by genetic variations common in Asian populations.<SEP>The objective of this study was to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with habitual coffee consumption and examine whether the association between coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined was modified by these genetic variants in Korean population.","2. Materials and Methods<SEP>2.1. Study Population<SEP>Participants were recruited from the Korea Association Resource (KARE) study, which is part of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), a community-based cohort study. A total of 5012 and 5018 participants aged 40–69 years were enrolled from Ansan and Ansung, respectively, between 2001 and 2002. Socio-demographic status, anthropometric indices, dietary lifestyle, physical activity, and disease history were examined at baseline and follow-up phase every 2 years. In this study, we included data from baseline to the 6th follow-up (2001–2014). The details of the KoGES project have been described elsewhere.<SEP>Among the 10,030 participants of this study, DNA samples from a total of 8840 participants were genotyped at baseline. We excluded participants who did not have genetic information (n = 1190); those who were diagnosed with a type 2 diabetes by physicians or had been treated with oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin therapy at baseline (n = 619); those who had a history of cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction and stroke (n = 150) or cancer (n = 20) at baseline; and those who did not provide daily coffee consumption frequency (n = 129) or amount (n = 54). In summary, 7868 participants (3685 men and 4183 women) were included in the GWAS (Table S1).<SEP>When we examined the association between habitual coffee consumption and the incident risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined, we further excluded participants who had prevalent type 2 diabetes (n = 666) or prediabetes (n = 2099) determined by the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test at baseline. We also excluded those who attended neither fifth nor sixth follow-up examination (n = 1049). As a result, a total of 4054 participants (1904 men and 2150 women) were included in the association analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University (IRB No. E1911/003-011).<SEP>2.2. Dietary Assessment<SEP>A 103-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for the KoGES was used to assess the habitual coffee consumption at baseline. The validity of the FFQ was evaluated by 3-day diet records. Participants were asked to answer the frequency of coffee consumption over the last year (almost none, 1 time/month, 2–3 times/month, 1–2 times/week, 3–4 times/week, 5–6 times/week, 1 time/day, 2 times/day or 3 times/day) as well as the amount of coffee (0.5, 1 or 2 cups per time). The amount of sugar added in coffee was also investigated (1, 2 or 3 teaspoons per time). We multiplied the frequency and the amount of the daily consumption of coffee to obtain the number of cups consumed per day. Coffee consumption was categorized into non-coffee consumers, <1 cup/day, 1 to <2 cups/day and ≥2 cups/day. Among coffee consumers, participants who consumed coffee without sugar were defined as black-coffee consumers and those who consumed coffee with sugar as sugared-coffee consumers.<SEP>We calculated the amount of caffeine consumption of each participant by using the caffeine database published by the Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or by contacting the product companies. The foods considered to contain caffeine were as follows: beverages (coffee, tea and soft drinks) and foods made with cocoa (chocolate, chocolate candies, chocolate ice cream, chocolate milk, chocolate pies, and chocolate cakes).<SEP>2.3. Ascertainment of Cases<SEP>Participants underwent a 2-h 75 g OGTT and HbA1c test at baseline and each follow-up. The concentrations of FPG and 2-h plasma glucose were measured by the hexokinase method (ADVIA 1650; Bayer, Berkley, MI, USA). Incident cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes were defined according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. Incident type 2 diabetes was ascertained if a participant had one of the following during the follow-up examination: had been diagnosed with a type 2 diabetes by physicians or had been treated with oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin therapy; had an FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥7.0 mmol/L); had a 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L); or had a HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. Prediabetes incidence was defined as an FPG ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L) or 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 140 mg/dL (≥7.8 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥ 6.0%.<SEP>2.4. Genotyping and Quality Control<SEP>DNA samples were genotyped using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The Bayesian Robust Linear Modeling using Mahalanobis Distance (BRLMM) Genotyping Algorithm was used for the genotype calling of 500,568 SNPs. After quality control filtering, a total of 352,228 SNPs remained for analysis. Details about quality control criteria have been described elsewhere.<SEP>2.5. GWAS on Coffee Consumption<SEP>We identified SNPs related to habitual coffee consumption in the GWAS. Participants were grouped into non-coffee consumers and coffee consumers, and this group information was used as a binary outcome variable in a logistic regression model for each SNP. We adjusted for age (years, continuous), sex, and alcohol consumption (g/day, continuous) in the GWAS. We also adjusted for baseline BMI in the secondary GWAS. In addition, we replicated a GWAS using a continuous variable of coffee consumption. A GWAS on continuous caffeine intake was also conducted. A box-cox transformed coffee or caffeine intake and a linear regression model were used for continuous analysis. A Manhattan plot and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot were generated, and the inflation factor (λ) was calculated. The GWAS was performed using PLINK version 1.07, and SNPs with a p-value < 1 × 10−5 were considered suggestive significant. A regional association plot of the significant SNPs was generated using the LocusZoom program (). The linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the significant SNPs was examined using the HaploView program.<SEP>2.6. Statistical Analysis<SEP>To calculate the genetic risk scores, each coffee-related SNP identified from the GWAS was assigned 0, 1, or 2 according to the number of minor alleles and then weighted by its relative effective size (β coefficient obtained from the GWAS). The genetic risk scores were calculated as following the equation: 5 × (β1 × SNP1 + β2 × SNP2 + β3 × SNP3 + β4 × SNP4 + β5 × SNP5)/(β1 + β2 + β3 + β4 + β5). The genetic risk scores ranged from 0 to 10 points, and the median value was 5 points among those with at least one minor allele. Participants were categorized into 3 groups: 0 point, 0.1 to <5 points, and 5 to 10 points. We examined the association between coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined in black coffee and sugared coffee. Non-coffee consumers and sugared-coffee consumers combined were regarded as reference group for black-coffee consumers. For sugared-coffee consumers, non-coffee consumers and black-coffee consumers combined were regarded as a reference group. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models among men and women combined or separately. The median cups of coffee consumed per day were assigned to each coffee group and used to test the linear trends. We also examined whether the association varied by genetic risk scores. The interaction analysis was performed by comparing the models with or without interaction term using a likelihood ratio test. All of the analyses were adjusted for age (years, continuous), sex (for men and women combined), body mass index (BMI, <23, 23 to <25, 25 to <30 and ≥30 kg/m2), smoking status (never smokers, ≤10 and >10 pack-years for black-coffee consumers; never smokers, ≤10, 10.1 to ≤20, 20.1 to ≤30 and >30 pack-years for sugared-coffee consumers), alcohol consumption (non-drinkers, ≤5, 5.1 to ≤10 and >10 g/day for black-coffee consumers; non-drinkers, ≤5, 5.1 to ≤10, 10.1 to ≤20 and >20 g/day for sugared-coffee consumers), family history of type 2 diabetes (yes or no), and total energy intake (kcal/day, continuous). Additionally, we also adjusted for the amount of sugar added in coffee when analyzing the association between black coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined (0, ≤5, 5.1 to ≤10, 10.1 to ≤15 and >15 g/day). SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all analyses, and p-value < 0.05 in two-sided tests was defined as a significant difference.","3. Results<SEP>3.1. Baseline Characteristics<SEP>Of the 4054 participants in the association analysis, a total of 480 (11.8%) and 2468 (60.9%) participants developed type 2 diabetes and prediabetes during the 12-year follow-up period, respectively. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study population according to habitual coffee consumption. Compared with non-coffee consumers, participants who consumed either black coffee or sugared coffee were more likely to be younger, smoke, drink alcohol, and have a higher BMI.<SEP>3.2. Genetic Polymorphisms Associated with Coffee Consumption<SEP>In the GWAS of habitual coffee consumption, a total of 18 SNPs located in 12q24 achieved a suggestive significance (p < 1 × 10−5) (Table S2). When we additionally adjusted for baseline BMI, the same 18 significant SNPs were identified as well (Table S3). SNPs identified based on habitual coffee consumption were the same when we additionally conducted a GWAS for continuous caffeine intake.<SEP>Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the Manhattan plot and regional association plot, respectively. Figure 3 shows the Q-Q plot, and the genomic inflation factor (λ) of the GWAS was 1.0103, suggesting that the study population structure was well-adjusted. Among the SNPs achieved suggestive significance at p < 1 × 10−5, we selected SNPs as follows, which were used later for calculating the genetic risk scores. First, pairwise correlations were examined and high correlation was declared when r2 > 0.8 (Figure 4). Then, we excluded all imputed SNPs having a high correlation with any genotyped SNP, and selected the SNPs among highly-correlated genotyped SNPs. As a result, three genotyped SNPs (rs2074356, rs11066015, and rs12229654) and two imputed SNPs (rs11065828 and rs79105258) were considered as coffee-related SNPs and used for calculating the genetic risk scores. Table 2 presents the information on these five SNPs related to coffee consumption. The SNPs were located in genes HECTD4, ACAD10, MYL2, and CUX2, and the minor allele frequency ranged from 0.143 to 0.172 in our population.<SEP>3.3. Coffee Consumption and the Risk of Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Combined<SEP>We examined the association between black coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined (Table 3). Compared with non-black-coffee consumers, participants who consumed ≥2 cups/day of black coffee had a 39% lower risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined among men and women combined (95% CI = 0.38–0.95; p for trend = 0.023). When we separated men and women, compared with non-black-coffee consumers, participants who consumed ≥2 cups/day of black coffee had a 54% lower risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined among men (95% CI = 0.23–0.94; p for trend = 0.026). Although the association was not statistically significant among women, an inverse trend was observed (OR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.41–1.34).<SEP>Table 4 presents the association between sugared coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined. The ORs (95% CIs) of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined comparing sugared-coffee consumers with non-sugared-coffee consumers were 0.73 (0.60–0.89; p for trend = 0.005) for men and women combined, 0.71 (0.52–0.97; p for trend = 0.015) for men, and 0.75 (0.57–0.99; p for trend = 0.080) for women.<SEP>3.4. Associations Modified by Genetic Risk Scores<SEP>We analyzed whether the association between habitual coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined varied by genetic polymorphisms. For black-coffee consumers, we found that an inverse association was more pronounced among individuals with high genetic risk scores, but the interaction was not statistically significant (p for interaction = 0.261) (Table 5). The ORs (95% CIs) for ≥2 cups/day of black coffee vs. non-black-coffee consumers were 0.87 (0.46–1.66) for participants with 0 points, 0.49 (0.17–1.44) for those with 0.1 to <5 points, and 0.36 (0.15–0.88) for those with 5 to 10 points for their genetic risk scores. For sugared coffee consumption, the associations with the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined were similar across genetic risk scores (p for interaction = 0.608) (Table 6). When we conducted an interaction analysis for each coffee-related SNP for black coffee consumption, the association between black coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined was inverse for the minor allele of each SNP (Table 7).","4. Discussion<SEP>Our first GWAS of coffee consumption in the Korean population identified five SNPs (rs2074356 in HECTD4, rs11066015 in ACAD10, rs12229654 in MYL2, rs11065828 and rs79105258 in CUX2) related to habitual coffee consumption. Compared with non-coffee consumers, the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes being combined was inversely associated with habitual coffee consumption, either black coffee or sugared coffee. Individuals with black coffee consumption had a lower risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined compared with non-black-coffee consumers among those with multiple minor alleles for these five SNPs.<SEP>The significant SNPs discovered to be related to habitual coffee consumption in our GWAS were all introns. Although the introns were noncoding regions of genes, they may affect the transcription rate and translation efficiency, further regulating gene expression. Recent GWASs have identified several loci on the AHR, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2 genes associated with coffee consumption. However, most of the GWASs on coffee consumption were conducted in European populations, only two GWASs, to our knowledge, reported SNPs related to coffee consumption in Asian populations. A GWAS in the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) study, the first GWAS on coffee consumption in Asia, found that rs2074356 located in 12q24 was most strongly associated with habitual coffee consumption (p = 2.2 × 10−6). Similarly, in our GWAS, a total of 18 SNPs were associated with coffee consumption at p < 1 × 10−5, all of which were found to be related to habitual coffee consumption in the J-MICC study, and the strongest significant variant was rs2074356 as well. Another Japanese coffee GWAS identified two independent loci (rs79105258 in 12q24 and rs10252701 in 7p21) that were associated with coffee consumption. rs79105258 was also selected as a coffee-related variant in our study. In addition to the association with habitual coffee consumption, these SNPs were associated with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose levels, blood pressure levels, and obesity. rs2074356 in HECTD4 was associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes and blood glucose level in a Korean population. Three SNPs (rs12229654, rs11066015 and rs2074356) were also identified to be linked with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a Japanese GWAS.<SEP>Previous epidemiologic studies have shown that coffee consumption was inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of 28 cohort and nested case-control studies reported that participants who consumed 5 cups/day of coffee had a 30% lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with almost non-consumers, and the associations were similar between men and women. Although we found a stronger inverse association among men than among women, further investigation is needed to explore a larger amount of coffee consumption, e.g., 3 or more cups/day, and whether the inverse association holds for women.<SEP>The lower risk of type 2 diabetes linked to coffee consumption could be linked to several biological mechanisms. As a main polyphenolic compound in coffee, chlorogenic acids have been shown as inhibitors of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glucose hydrolysis. Reduced hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase may affect the glucose output and thus decrease the blood glucose concentration. In addition, chlorogenic acids act as antioxidants to lower oxidative stress shown in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Additionally, caffeine and magnesium, both of which are commonly found in coffee, have been suggested to have roles in type 2 diabetes prevention by improving insulin resistance. Previous studies suggested that caffeine could improve insulin resistance by stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells. In addition to insulin secretion, caffeine increases thermogenesis, lipolysis, and β-oxidation. Magnesium supplementation has reduced the development of type 2 diabetes and improved glucose disposal in experimental studies, and cohort studies have reported a significant inverse association between magnesium intake and type 2 diabetes risk.<SEP>In this study, we observed that both black coffee and sugared coffee decreased the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined for individuals who consumed more than 2 cups of coffee per day. But participants who consumed 1 to <2 cups/day of sugared coffee had a 45% higher risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined among men alone, but not among women. Although sugar-sweetened beverage intake including carbonated beverages has been positively associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes, the results of coffee with sugar remained equivocal. In a French cohort study, compared to non-coffee consumers, the incident type 2 diabetes decreased by 40% and 31% among participants consuming more than 1.1 cups of coffee per lunch with or without sugar, respectively. In a small clinical trial, where eight lean, young and healthy adults drank six types of beverages or water 1 h before a potato-based meal, postprandial hyperglycemia, an early abnormality of type 2 diabetes, was significantly reduced when they drank sweetened coffee before their meals. Further studies are needed to examine whether the benefit of coffee remains even after adding a small amount of sugar.<SEP>To our knowledge, this study is the first GWAS of habitual coffee consumption in a Korean population. The strengths of this study include good ascertainment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, adjustment for potential confounding factors, and a 12-year follow-up. The incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes were identified based on the circulating levels of FPG, 2-h plasma glucose, and HbA1c, which could minimize the misclassification. Adjustment for potential confounding factors, including smoking status and alcohol consumption, may enable us to remove the effect of the confounding factors. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that residual confounding factors remained. There are several limitations to our study. First, the rate of revisits to the clinic for the blood draw decreased to 60% in the last sixth follow-up. Therefore, our study may not be representative of the full cohort of KARE study. However, the internal validity may not be impaired as we obtained relatively accurate information on the incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes during the 12-year follow-up. Second, we could not distinguish caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee or boiled and filtered coffee. However, previous studies have shown that the associations between coffee and type 2 diabetes were similar by the amount of caffeine or preparation methods. Third, we were not able to examine high coffee consumption (e.g., 3 or more cups/day) because only a few participants consumed more than 3 cups/day. Fourth, we did not consider medicinal caffeine intake when we performed a GWAS. However, beverages may mainly contribute to daily caffeine intake in Korea.",23127,"['OBWCCE', 'EATBTS']"
26596471,"One of the key phenotype of type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by the autoimmune-mediated destruction of the pancreatic β cells. The autoimmune attack on the pancreatic β cells can be detected years before clinical onset of T1DM-related autoantibodies in the blood. Prospective studies of T1DM have established that T1DM exhibits the elevated levels of inflammatory markers before diagnosis of diabetes. There is a significant elevation in the interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and IL-1β levels in preclinical diabetes samples. These cytokines can induce β-cell death in T1DM. The autoimmunity may occur because of instructive immune responses. Persistent elevation of proinflammatory cytokines in the body can be defined as a risk factor that, either alone or in combination with other environment factors, may predispose to the loss of self-tolerance and the onset of T1DM-related autoantibodies.<SEP>Adipose tissue functions are closely linked to development of diabetes, particularly type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The roles of adipose tissue in glucose metabolism, lipodystrophy and insulin resistance are well known. Recent studies indicate that adipose tissue is not simply the organ that stores fat and regulates lipid metabolism but also is the largest endocrine organ with immune functions. Adipocytes produce several mediators, such as adiponectin, resistin, IL-6, TNF-α, leptin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (or CCL2) and IL-1β, all of which participate in the immune response as proinflammatory mediators. It is reported that adipocytes are responsible for almost one-third of the IL-6 concentration in diabetic patients.<SEP>One of the critical activators of inflammatory genes is NF-κB. Experimental evidences have suggested that SUMOylation components regulate NF-κB signalling and transcriptional activity. NEMO is part of the cytoplasmic IκBα kinase (IKK) complex that is critical for NF-κB activation not only by the majority of extracellular signals, including TNF-α and IL-1β, but also in response to many genotoxic stress agents. NEMO is SUMO1 modified on K277/K309 with the help of SUMO E1/E2 and an E3 (PIASy). The reverse SUMOylation of NEMO by SUMO endopeptidases (SENPs) plays an important role in inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activity and NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation.<SEP>As a post-translational modification, SUMOylation is involved in various cellular processes, such as nuclear–cytosolic transport, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, protein stability, response to stress and cell cycle progression. SUMOylation is a dynamic process that is mediated by activating, conjugating and ligating enzymes, and is readily reversed by a family of deSUMOylating proteases SENPs. SENP1 is a deSUMOylating protease that deconjugates a large number of SUMOylated proteins. Previously, we and others have observed that a global deletion of SENP1 causes deficient haematopoiesis and prenatal lethality, therefore excluding further studies on the role of SENP1 in inflammation and diabetes. Interestingly, several components in SUMOylation have been identified as candidate genes implicated in T1DM susceptibility. However, the underlying mechanism by which SUMOylation pathway regulates T1DM, and whether or not the SUMOylation signalling play a role in adipocyte is unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we attempt to address whether persistent protein SUMOylation in adipocytes affects T1DM onset and progression.<SEP>We have created genetically modified mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of SENP1 with three different adipocyte-specific Cre deleter lines. Our present data show that adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice are viable but develop the major phenotypes of T1DM, including hyperglycaemia, glucose intolerance, increases in cytotoxic T cells and autoantibody production. This diabetic phenotype observed in SENP1-deficient mice is associated with high SUMOylation of NEMO, a key component regulating NF-κB, in pancreatic adipocytes. Our data suggest that NEMO SUMOylation in adipocytes is a strong risk factor in T1DM.","Methods<SEP>Adipocyte-specific SENP1 knockout mice<SEP>SENP1+/lox mice were generated by inserting loxP sites surrounding the SENP1 gene exons 5 and 6, based on homologous recombination. SENP1lox/lox mice were obtained by intercrossing SENP1+/lox mice. SENP1lox/lox mice were mated with three different deleter lines carrying the Cre recombinase driven by the Adiponectin (obtained from Jackson Laboratory), PdgfRα (obtained from Dr Matthew Rodeheffer at Yale University School of Medicine) or aP2/Fabp4 gene promoter (BI line from Dr Barbara Kahn, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical School, Harvard Medical School). All mice had been subsequently backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background for >6th generations. The deletion of SENP1 in adipocytes of SENP1lox/lox:Cre was verified by quantitativePCR with reverse transcription using primers amplifying exons 5–6 (ref.) and specific Cre. SENP1+/+:Cre and SENP1lox/lox mice used as controls. Mice were cared for in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines, and all procedures were approved by the Yale University Animal Care and Use Committee.<SEP>HFD challenge<SEP>Mice were fed a standard chow containing 10% fat, 70% carbohydrate 20% protein (D12450B, OpenSource DIETS) or a HFD containing 45.0% fat, 35.0% carbohydrate and 20% protein (D12451; OpenSource DIETS, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) at 4 weeks of age for 4–16 weeks. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Yale University.<SEP>Rescue of diabetic phenotype by NF-κB inhibitor<SEP>NF-κB Activation Inhibitor II JSH-23 is an inhibitor of NF-κB transcriptional activity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration=7.1 μM) by inhibiting the mechanism of transcription, without affecting the process of IκBα degradation. To address whether the NF-κB activation inhibitor rescued diabetic phenotype in mice, SENP1lox /lox and SENP1lox /lox: aP2-Cre were intraperitoneally injected with NF-κB Activation Inhibitor II (JSH-23; sc-222061; at 2 mg kg−1 in 10% DMSO diluted in PBS) twice per week from the age of 5 weeks for 6 weeks. Vehicle (10% DMSO in PBS) was used as a control. Tissues were collected at week 13.<SEP>Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion<SEP>Experiments were performed in static incubation. In brief, islets (100 islets per well) were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Kreb's buffer (140 mmol l−1 NaCl, 30 mmol l−1 HEPES, 4.6 mmol l−1 KCl, 1 mmol l−1 MgSO4, 0.15 mmol l−1 Na2HPO4, 5 mmol l−1 NaHCO3, 2 mmol l−1 CaCl2 and 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4) containing 3 mmol l−1 D-glucose. Then, the plates were cooled down on ice water and the supernatants were replaced with cold Kreb's buffer containing 16.7 mmol l−1 D-glucose. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the insulin released into the supernatant was measured. Concentrations of insulin (ng ml−1) in the supernatants were directly used to evaluate insulin secretion.<SEP>Metabolic characterization<SEP>The control or SENP1-aP2KO mice were fed with normal chow, water consumption and food intake was recorded daily. For the GTT and ITT, the mice were fasted overnight, followed by an intraperitoneal injection of glucose (GTT; 1 g kg−1 body weight) or insulin (ITT; 0.75 U kg−1 body weight). Blood glucose levels at various times after the injections were determined by an electronic glucometer (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA). Lipids analysis and lipoprotein profile measurement were performed. In brief, mice were fasted for 12–14 h before blood samples were collected by retro-orbital venous plexus puncture. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. Total plasma cholesterol, TGs and FFAs were enzymatically measured with the Amplex red cholesterol assay kit (Molecular Probes), serum triglyceride determination kit and free fatty acid kit (Sigma), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lipid distribution in plasma lipoprotein fractions were assessed by fast-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration with two Superose 6 HR 10/30 columns (Pharmacia).<SEP>Islet isolation and primary culture<SEP>Pancreatic islets were isolated from 3-month-old Ctrl and KO mice by collagenase P (Roche Applied Science) digestion. Islets were picked by hand four times in succession under a dissecting microscope and cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 mmol l−1 glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mmol l−1 HEPES, 2 mmol l−1 L-glutamine, 1 mmol l−1 sodium pyruvate, 50 μmol l−1 β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units penicillin per ml and 100 μg streptomycin per ml. For islet apoptosis assay, islets were isolated from the Ctrl mice and incubation for 16 h to recover from the harsh process of collagenase digestion. Islets (100 islets per well) were cultured with the serum from Ctrl, SENP1-aP2KO, NOD mice or human T1DM patients for 72 h. Islet viability was assessed by Live/Dead Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Molecular Probe).<SEP>Cell lines and isolation of mature adipocytes<SEP>3T3-L1, a commonly used preadipocyte mouse cell line, was obtained from ATCC (CL-173) and cultured under DMEM media supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% calf serum. The cell line validation by karyotyping and mycoplasma testing was performed before shipping from ATCC. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 to adipocyte was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In brief, cells were cultured at sub-confluent (70–80%) 1:50 to 1:100, that is, seeding at 2–4 × 10,000 cells per cm2 in a 75-cm2 flask using 0.25% trypsin or trypsin/EDTA; 5% CO2; 37 °C. Two days after confluency differentiation was induced by adding 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.25 μM dexamethoasone and 1 μg ml−1 insulin in DMEM with 10% FBS. After 2 days, the 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and dexamethasone, but not insulin, were removed in culture for another 2 days. On day 4, differentiated cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and media were changed every other day for 2–4 weeks. The differentiated cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 2 h before experiments.<SEP>For primary adipocyte culture, adipose tissue was dissected from peri-pancreas or epididymal fat and incubated in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 U ml−1 collagenase and 40 mg ml−1 BSA in a shaking bath at 37 °C for 1 h. The adipocytes were filtered through a polypropylene mesh (pore size 250 μm) and washed three times in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer with 0.1% BSA. Macrophage and T cells were labelled with phycoerythrin (PE)-CD11b and PE-CD3e antibodies and depleted with magnetically labelled PE antibody using an EasySep magnet (Stem Cell Technologies). The cells were incubated in DMEM/F-12 containing BSA at the concentrations of 300 mM for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (ref.). For isolation pancreatic macrophage or T cells, PE-CD11b or PE-CD3e antibodies labelled cells were collected with magnetically labelled PE antibody using an EasySep magnet (Stem Cell Technologies).<SEP>Clinical specimens<SEP>Ethical evaluation for the clinical specimens, and blood draws, from consenting human volunteers was reviewed and approved by the Yale human Investigation Committee (IHC#1005006865). Venous blood was drawn from volunteers (healthy and diabetic subjects) after obtaining consent at Yale University School of Medicine. Twenty-nine subjects with T1DM (American Diabetes Association definition) and 21 healthy control subjects were recruited for the studies based on established exclusion/inclusion criteria (glucose levels, body mass index, HbA1c and so on; Supplementary Table 1). Deidentified plasma was obtained from whole blood by centrifugation and immediately frozen at −80 °C.<SEP>Insulin autoantibodies ELISA<SEP>Plasma IAA levels were analysed with mouse IAA ELISA kit (Biorbyt, CA, USA). Plasma samples (1:2 dilutions) were incubated in 96-well plates precoated with IAA antibody overnight. After washing, FITC-labelled IAA detection antibody was added for 1 h. FITC fluorescence intensity of bound antibody was detected with a MRX microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, VA, USA).<SEP>Flow cytometer<SEP>Cells from pancreases were isolated from both SENP1-aP2KO and Ctrl mice. Immune cells were detected using LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and the FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). Surface staining was performed using T-cell markers (CD3e, CD4 and CD8), Mac/DC markers (MHCII, CD11c, CD11b and CD68) and the B-cell marker CD19 (BD). Intracellular staining was performed for adipocyte (Nile, IL-6, TNF-α, IFNγ and IL-1β), T-cell subset Th1 (CD3e, CD4 and IFNγ), Th17 (CD3e, CD4 and IL-17) and regulatory T cell (CD4, CD25 and Foxp3). Isotype controls were used in each experiment.<SEP>Monitoring of antigen-specific CD8 T cells<SEP>CD8+ T cells were isolated from spleen and pancreatic lymph nodes of Ctrl and KO mice and staining with H-2Kd NRP-V7 Tetramer-KYNKANVFL-Allophycocyani (APC) (MHC Tetramer Core Facility, Atlanta, GA, USA). In addition, an APC-labelled negative tetramer H-2Kd TUM Tetramer-KYQAVTTTL-APC was used as a control to assess the level of background fluorescence and nonspecific binding.<SEP>β-Cell apoptosis analysis<SEP>Paraffin-embedded pancreases were sectioned at 7-μm intervals and subjected to TUNEL staining using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). For islet cells, this reaction was blocked with a blocking buffer, and the slides were immunostained with rabbit anti-insulin (β cell) and goat anti-glucagon (α-cell; Cell Signaling Tech, Danvers, MA, USA) for 2 h and then with donkey-derived secondary antibodies conjugated to PE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All slides were mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing medium. Fluorescent slides were viewed using a Leica DM6000 microscope, and images were acquired using software. Apoptosis was analysed by counting the TUNEL-positive β cells in each islet. Alternatively, islets were isolated from pancreases, β cells in islets were gated as insulin positive cells with a flow cytometer and apoptotic cells were identified as TUNEL-positive cells.<SEP>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay<SEP>The ChIP assay was performed using ChIP kit (Millipore; #17–371) with p65/RelA antibody (SC-109; 1:40 dilution, 5 μg ml−1) and analysed by real-time PCR. All the primers are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Normal IgG (SC-2027; 1:40 dilution, 5 μg ml−1) was used as an isotype control. Anti-RNA polymerase II (Millipore, #05–623B; 1:500, 2 μg ml−1) was used as a positive control.<SEP>Quantitative real-time PCR<SEP>Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed by a standard procedure (Super Script First-Strand Synthesis System; Invitrogen) using 1 μg of total RNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix on an iCycler Real-Time Detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Specific primers for mouse cytokines, chemokines, SENP1 and GAPDH genes were used. The relative amount of mRNA was normalized with a housekeeping GAPDH as indicated and was quantified. Real-time PCR with reverse transcription reactions were also performed using TaqMan 2 × PCR Master Mix, TaqMan PCR reagents and commercially available TaqMan gene expression probes for chemokines or hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Standard curves with known concentration of template copy numbers were used to determine the expression of amplified targets. The expression level of each target gene was normalized to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and the results were given as relative copy numbers.<SEP>Haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry<SEP>Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 7-μm intervals, and the sections were subjected to standard haematoxylin and eosin staining or immunostained using primary antibodies, with anti-CD8, anti-CD4, anti-CD31, anti-CCL5, anti-insulin, anti-FABP4, anti-p-p65/RelA and anti-F4/80, with isotype-matched primary antibodies serving as controls. Antibody binding was visualized with fluorescence-labelled secondary antibodies and examined by microscopy. The sections that were paraffin-embedded were dewaxed before being treated with anti-mouse antibodies.<SEP>RNA interference for SENP1<SEP>In view of the established characteristics of siRNA-targeting constructs, we designed three pairs of siRNA oligonucleotides for SENP1: siRNA 21696: 5′-GGAAAUGGAGAAAGAAAUA dTdT-3′; siRNA21512: 5′-GGACCAGCUUUCGCUUUCU dTdT-3′; siRNA21605: 5′-GGACAUUUGGACCGAUCUU dTdT-3′. Three siRNAs were obtained similar knockdown efficiency. The corresponding scramble siRNA oligonucleotide for siRNA21512: 5′-GGA CCA GCA UAC GCU UUCU dTdT-3′, with two nucleotide mutations (underlined), was synthesized from Ambion (Austin, TX, USA). siRNAs (20 μM) were transfected into cells by Oligofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.; Invitrogen), following protocols provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). At 72 h post transfection, cells were collected for analysis.<SEP>SENP1 plasmid construct and gene overexpression<SEP>Expression plasmids for GFP-tagged SENP1 were generated by inserting mouse SENP1 into pEGFP-C2. Adipocytes were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000. SENP1 vectors (1 μg) were transfected into cells by Oligofectamine, following protocols provided by the manufacturer. At 48 h post transfection, cells were collected for protein analysis.<SEP>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting<SEP>Adipocytes were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 1.5 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mg ml−1 aprotinin, 10 mg ml−1 leupeptin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and 1 mM EDTA) on ice. For detection of SUMOylated proteins, 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide (deSUMOylase inhibitor) was added to cell lysates. For western blotting, proteins were detected by SENP1, p65/RelA, IκBα and ERK1/2, pIκBα, p-p65/RelA, pIKKα/β, IKKβ and pERK1/2 antibodies, and secondary antibodies, with the use of a chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). To ensure equal loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed for β-actin using anti-actin antibodies. For protein SUMOylation assay, adipocytes were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in denaturing lysis buffer (1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors 15 U ml−1 and DNase1). Cell lysates were heated at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by dilution with 0.9 ml nondenaturing lysis buffer. Supernatants of cell lysates were precleared by incubating with protein A/G PLUS-Agarose for 2 h. The lysates were then incubated with anti-NEMO or anti-p65/RelA, with 50 μl of protein A/G PLUS-Agarose on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were collected after each immunoprecipitation by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 10 min, followed by washes with lysis buffer. The immune complexes were subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting with the SUMO1, NEMO or p65/RelA-specific antibodies. All antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 3. Uncropped scans of the original western blots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8.<SEP>Site-directed mutagenesis of SUMOylation sites K277 and K309 of NEMO<SEP>The SUMOylation sites of NEMO were mapped to the positions K277 and K309. The pcDNA flag-NEMO K277 and/or K309 mutation expression vectors were generated using a pcDNA flag-NEMO-WT template and the QuickChange XL-II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA).<SEP>Study design and statistical analysis<SEP>Group sizes were determined by an a priori power analysis for a two-tailed, two-sample t-test with an α of 0.05 and power of 0.8, to detect a 10% difference in diabetic parameters (for example, glucose level, insulin level, lipid profile, body weight and cytokines) at the end point. Animals were grouped with no blinding but randomized during the experiments. No samples or animals were excluded from analysis. All quantifications (for example, glucose level, insulin level, lipid profile, body weight, cytokines, apoptosis, immune cell populations, NF-κB activation, infiltration and islet disruption) were performed in a blind manner. All figures are representative of at least three experiments unless otherwise noted. All graphs report mean±s.e.m. values of biological replicates. Comparisons between two groups were performed by paired t-test, between more than two groups by one-way analysis of varinace followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test or by two-way analysis of varinace using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad). P values were two-tailed and values <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. P<0.05, P<0.01 and P<0.001 are designated in all figures unless specified with *, ** and ***, respectively.<SEP>Additional information<SEP>How to cite this article: Shao, L. et al. SENP1-mediated NEMO deSUMOylation in adipocytes limits inflammatory responses and type-I diabetes progression. Nat. Commun. 6:8917 doi: 10.1038/ncomms9917 (2015).","Results<SEP>SENP1-deficient mice exhibit T1DM phenotype<SEP>To investigate possible function of SENP1 in inflammation and diabetes, we created genetically modified mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of SENP1 with three different deleter lines carrying the Cre recombinase driven by the Adiponectin, PdgfRα or aP2/Fabp4 gene promoter (named as SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 1A). While the PdgfRα-Cre is predominantly expressed in bipotent progenitor adipocytes (white and beige adipocytes), the Adipoq-Cre has high efficiency and specificity in mature adipocytes. The aP2-Cre has a moderate efficiency in adipocytes with variable degrees of target gene recombination in macrophages or capillary endothelium in a floxed gene locus-dependent manner.<SEP>SENP1 expression (messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein) was diminished in isolated adipocytes from interscapular brown adipose tissue, perigonadal white adipose tissue and peri-pancreatic adipose tissue (PAT) of SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO (with less efficiency in brown adipose tissue) and SENP1-aP2KO mice compared with the control SENP1lox/lox (Ctrl). In contrast, SENP1 expression was intact in isolated macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) and pancreatic islets from these mice (Supplementary Fig. 1B–C). Moreover, enhanced green fluorescent protein was detected in PATs but not in pancreatic islets when aP2-Cre deleter mice mating with mT/mG reporter mice (Supplementary Fig. 1D).<SEP>SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice were viable after birth. However, these adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice all developed a diabetic phenotype (Fig. 1a–c). An age-dependent increase in glucose levels was observed in SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice compared with the control SENP1lox/lox mice with an early onset of diabetes in SENP1-PdgfRKO at the age of 6 weeks (blood glucose level >225 mg dl−1); this earlier onset of hyperglycaemia is consistent with the high efficiency of PdgfRα-Cre in adipocyte progenitors. We observed similar phenotypic changes in both male (Fig. 1a–c) and female with or without fasting, and we focused on male mice for further studies. We measured glucose levels in SENP1-smKO and SENP1-ecKO mice, in which the SENP1 gene was specifically deleted in smooth muscle cells/pericytes by SM22α-Cre (SENP1-smKO) and in vascular endothelial cells by VE-cadherin-Cre (SENP1-ecKO), respectively. Unlike SENP1-aP2KO mice, SENP1-smKO and SENP1-ecKO mice did not develop a high-glucose phenotype even at the age of 14 weeks (Fig. 1d).<SEP>Insulin levels in plasma were measured at various ages, and insulin secretion in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice was significantly declined after the ages of 8 and 10 weeks, respectively (Fig. 1e,f). Glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed at the age of 14 weeks to evaluate diabetes and insulin resistance. The level of hyperglycaemia observed with the GTT was prolonged in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice compared with Ctrl mice (Fig. 1g–j). However, similar insulin responses were observed between SENP1-deficient mice and Ctrl in the ITT assays (Fig. 1k,l for aP2KO mice). We then performed glucose-stimulated insulin assay with isolated islets. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from SENP1-deficient islets was significantly reduced (Fig. 1m). These data suggest that the high glucose level in SENP1-deficient mice was due to reduced insulin secretion.<SEP>The body weight and body mass are associated with the development of diabetes and increases in glucose levels. All SENP1-deficient mice had lower body weights compared with the control mice after onset of diabetes (Fig. 2a–d). However, adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice exhibited normal lipid profiles up to the age of 14 weeks, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA). Cholesterol and TG, but not HDL or FFA, were slightly reduced in SENP1-aP2KO mice after the age of 18 weeks (Fig. 2e–g). Water consumption and food-intake monitoring showed that SENP1-aP2KO mice had increased water consumption with similar dairy food uptake compared with Ctrl mice (Fig. 2h–i). Taken together, the assays described above suggest that type-1-like diabetic phenotypes developed in the adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice.<SEP>SENP1 deficient mice show autoimmune mediated damages<SEP>Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus results from T-cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet β cells. To determine the pathogenesis of diabetes in SENP1-deficient mice, we examined pancreatic development and pathology by haematoxylin and eosin stain and immunostaining for pancreatic β-cell number, mass and morphology changes, as well as immune cell invasion, indicative of insulitis. At early ages before the onset of hyperglycaemia, no significant differences were detected in pancreatic mass, β-cell number between the Ctrl and SENP1-deficient mice. However, the structures of pancreatic islets in SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice were drastically disrupted with increased TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL)-positive apoptosis of β cells after onset of diabetes and more severe at late stages (Fig. 3a–c for SENP1-aP2KO; Supplementary Fig. 2 for SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-PdgfRKO). There was a sharp decline in insulin staining and CD31+ vascular area in the islets in SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 3d with quantifications in Fig. 3e), indicating a loss of function in the β cell with disrupted vasculatures. These data provide direct evidence in support of apoptosis as the mechanism of β-cell death in SENP1-deficient mice.<SEP>Immune cell-specific effector T-cell invasion in the pancreatic tissue attacks the islets and induces cell death. We observed an accumulation of white blood cells invasion into the islets in SENP1-deficient mice. In T1DM, β cell and islets are attacked by activated cytotoxic T cells. The section staining in the pancreases demonstrated that CD8+ T cells were absent from the islets of Ctrl mice. No pancreatic infiltrations of immune cells were detected in the SENP1-aP2KO mice under the age of 7 weeks. However, CD8+ T cells infiltrated into the islets of SENP1-aP2KO mice by the age of 12 weeks (Fig. 3f,g). Similar results were observed for CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A–B). These data strongly suggest a T-cell dominant mechanism for β-cell destruction.<SEP>The pre-diabetic phase of the disease usually begins several years before the clinical onset of the disease. During this phase, autoantibodies, mainly insulin autoantibody (IAA), are directed against β cells. IAA levels, along with other clinical information, aid in the diagnosis of T1DM. CRP and β-hydroxybutyrate are important clinical parameters for the diagnosis of diabetes. Individuals who develop diabetes typically have higher CRP levels. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is classified as ketones that are produced in the body when the body loses its ability to absorb glucose properly. SENP1-aP2KO mice had increased levels of IAA in the blood as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with an IAA-specific antibody. Greater levels of CRP and β-hydroxybutyrate were also observed in the blood of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 3h–j). All of the above data support the appearance of typical T1DM in SENP1-aP2KO mice.<SEP>We then fully characterized the immune system in the SENP1-deficient mice. We transplanted skin from mice (BALB/C) to Ctrl SENP1lox/lox and SENP1-aP2KO mice (C57BL/6 background). Severe skin-rejection response appeared in both Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice at an equal level, indicating SENP1-aP2KO mice are not immunodeficient (Supplementary Fig. 3C). We examined the immune cell populations in pancreas, pancreatic lymph nodes and spleen of SENP1-deficient mice. The distribution of immune cells in the pancreases was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses with specific surface markers. MHCII+CD11b+CD11c− macrophages, CD3e+ T cells and CD19+ B cells were markedly increased in the pancreases of SENP1-aP2KO versus the Ctrl mice (Supplementary Fig. 3D for FACS and Fig. 3k for quantifications). Subset T cells play a key role in regulation of inflammation and immune tolerance. We observed that Th1 (IFN-γ+CD4+) and Th17 (IL-17+CD4+) effector T-cell subsets expanded concomitant with reduction of regulatory T-cell subset (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) in the pancreatic lymph nodes of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 3E–G for FACS and Fig. 3l for quantifications). We also observed an increase in activated dendritic cells in the lymph node of pancreases (Fig. 3m). Moreover, an autoantigen NRP-V7-positive CD8+ T cells, targeting a peptide from islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein, were detected in the pancreatic lymph nodes and the spleen of SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 12 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 3H for FACS and Fig. 3n,o for quantifications). All of the events suggest autoimmune responses occur in the pancreases of SENP1-deficient mice, consistent with that T1DM is an autoimmune disease in which insulin deficiency is a consequence of immunological destruction of the pancreatic β cells.<SEP>PATs secret cytokines<SEP>The proinflammatory cytokines overproduction in early phase of disease could serve as a main reason for immunologic tolerance break and immune cell expansion in diabetes. We found that the circulating proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and IL-Iβ, but not IFN-γ, were significantly elevated in the SENP1-deficient mice before the onset of diabetes at the age of 7 weeks (Fig. 4a). However, the levels of circulating cytokines might be too low to induce systemic autoimmune responses. Consistently, SENP1-deficient mice had normal cardiac function and vascular reactivity. These mice exhibit increased systemic cytokines and cardiac myocarditis at the age of 14 weeks or older, indicating a prevalence of diabetic phenotype in the SENP1-deficient mice.<SEP>Adipose tissue has been recognized as the largest endocrine organ and produces a large amount of cytokines. We reasoned that PATs might express high levels of cytokines to induce local (pancreas) inflammatory responses and diabetic phenotype in SENP1-deficient mice. Indeed, PATs from SENP1-aP2KO mice expressed high levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β at the age of 7 weeks (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 4A). We also compared cytokine transcripts expressed in the adipocytes from PATs, subcutaneous (inguinal) and gonadal and peri-renal adipose tissues at the age of 7 weeks. Ctrl mice expressed little basal cytokines in all adipose tissues. We did not observe significant differences for SENP1 deletion in different adipose depots. However, SENP1 deletion strongly enhanced gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the PATs compared with other adipose depots (Fig. 4c). To exclude the impact of macrophages or T cells affects the cytokine concentration, we examined immune cell numbers and cell-type-specific cytokine expression in the pancreas and PATs. We did not detect significant differences in cell numbers of macrophages and T cells in PATs (Fig. 4d) or pancreas of Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 7 weeks. Moreover, expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β by isolated pancreatic T cells and macrophages were >10-fold lower than isolated PAT adipocytes as measured by ELISA (Fig. 4e). Similar results were obtained from measuring intracellular cytokine levels in adipocytes, T cells and macrophages within PATs by FACS on intracellular staining of single cells (Supplementary Fig. 4B), suggesting that peri-pancreatic adipocytes primarily contribute to cytokine production in SENP1-aP2KO mice before the onset of diabetes. Of note, we detected macrophages infiltration into the pancreases of SENP1-aP2KO mice at later phases (14 weeks), and these macrophages expressed high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 4C–D).<SEP>We reasoned that the local high concentrations of cytokines might induce chemokine expression in adjacent pancreatic islets to recruit immune cells. It is known that CCL5 (RANTES, the CCR5 ligand) can direct recruitment of immune cells to inflammation sites or to autoimmune targets that may contribute to type-1 diabetic development. We analysed gene expression of chemokines that had been reported to be expressed in the pancreas. We found that CCL5 was strongly upregulated in the pancreatic islets of SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 7 weeks before disease the onset. CCL2, CCL21, CXCL19 and CXCL10 were weakly upregulated in pancreatic islets of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 4f). Expression of CCL5 in islet β cells was confirmed by co-staining of CCL5 with insulin (Fig. 4g). However, upregulation of CCL5 was not detected in other tissues of SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 7 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 4E), suggesting a specific effect of PAT-derived cytokines on adjacent islets. This is consistent with human protein expression database that CCL5 is only detected in pancreas but not in other tissues except blood and immune cells (GeneCards; http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CCL5). We then directly tested whether proinflammatory cytokines secreted from PATs could induce CCL5 expression in isolated islets. CCL5 mRNA in islets was significantly upregulated by conditional media of SENP1-aP2KO pancreatic adipocytes, and this upregulation was reduced by a neutralizing antibody to IL-6, TNF or IL-1β, and blunted by a combination of the three antibodies (Fig. 4h). These data suggest that high levels of local proinflammatory cytokines secreted from PATs induces CCL5 expression in islets, which in turn recruits immune cells into pancreas, causing damages of β cells.<SEP>We also tested a direct effect of adipocyte-derived cytokines on the pancreatic islets. To this end, isolated normal mouse pancreatic islets were incubated with culture supernatant of adipocytes from Ctrl or SENP1-aP2KO, and islet structure and apoptosis were monitored by Live/Dead viability/Cytotoxicity assays. We found that culture supernatant from adipocytes of SENP1-aP2KO strongly induced β-cell death and pancreatic disruption (Fig. 4i,j), suggesting that cytokines from peri-pancreatic adipocytes of SENP1-aP2KO mice have direct cytotoxic effects on pancreatic islet.<SEP>Taken together, these results indicate that high local concentrations of cytokines derived from PATs not only upregulate CCL5 expression and CCL5-mediated infiltration of immune cells in pancreas but also directly induce cytotoxic damages on pancreatic islets.<SEP>SENP1 deletion augments NF-κB dependent inflammation<SEP>It has been proposed that adipose tissue depots originate from distinct precursor cells are functionally diverse, and modulate disease processes in a depot-specific manner. We observed that peri-pancreatic adipocytes from SENP1-aP2KO exhibit 1.8-fold smaller cell sizes (Fig. 5a,b) with two- to three folds more cell numbers than the Ctrl adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5A–B). Moreover, peri-pancreatic adipocytes from SENP1-aP2KO mice expressed reduced differentiation markers including fatty acid synthase, adipose triglyceride lipase and lipoprotein lipase (Fig. 5c). In contrast, gonadal and subcutaneous inguinal adipocytes in SENP1-aP2KO mice exhibited a much weaker phenotype; they showed a smaller size at old ages (14 weeks) without significant increases in cell numbers; these phenotypes likely contribute to the reduced fat pad weight (Supplementary Fig. 5C–H) and total body weight of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-PdgfRKO mice. These data are consistent with the notion that a reduced state of adipocyte differentiation correlates with enhanced proinflammatory phenotype in some adipose depots.<SEP>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) is not only the master regulator of adipogenesis but also plays a critical role in repressing inflammatory responses in a SUMOylation-dependent manner. Therefore, we first examined whether PPARγ was a SENP1 target in adipocytes. We found that expression of total PPARγ mRNA and protein levels were similar in Ctrl and SENP1-deficient adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5I,J). Although PPARγ was SUMOylated in both Ctrl and SENP1-null adipocytes, no significant difference was detected between Ctrl and SENP1-deficient cells (Supplementary Fig. 5K,L). These results suggest that SUMOylation of PPARγ may not contribute to the reduced adipogenesis and enhanced cytokine production in PATs of SENP1-deficient mice.<SEP>NF-κB is a critical activator of genes for inflammation and immune regulation. We observed that phosphorylations of IKK, IκBα and NF-κB subunit p65/RelA were increased with concomitant reduction of total IκBα in the adipose tissues of SENP1-aP2KO mice. In contrast, phosphorylation and total levels of ERK1/2 in adipose tissues were not affected by SENP1 deletion (Fig. 5d). NF-κB was further determined by intracellular staining for phosphor-p65/RelA in PAT sections. We observed phosphor-p65/RelA positive staining in the PAT, but not in the pancreas (Fig. 5e). The phosphor-p65/RelA was much stronger in SENP1-aP2KO adipocytes, marked by adipocyte-specific marker FABP4 (Fig. 5f,g). However, phosphor-p65/RelA was not localized with a macrophage marker F4/80 (Fig. 5h). We further performed p65/RelA chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in Ctrl and SENP1-deficient cells isolated from Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice. We observed increased p65/RelA bindings to the IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α promoters in SENP1-aP2KO adipocytes (Fig. 5i,j). To directly test whether SENP1 deficiency regulates the NF-κB activation and cytokine production in adipocytes in vitro, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were first differentiated into the mature adipocytes and then transfected with a Ctrl or SENP1 short interfering RNA (siRNA). In the adipocytes with the SENP1 knockdown, phosphorylated IKK, IκBα and NF-κB p65/RelA levels were increased markedly (Fig. 5k). The gene expressions of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1 β, but not IFN-γ) from adipocytes were significantly higher in SENP1 knockdown cells (Fig. 5l), which concurs with our observations in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice, as well as in adipocytes isolated from these mice. Conversely, overexpression of SENP1 into SENP1-deficient adipocytes markedly decreased phospho-p65/RelA and cytokine productions. Taken together, our results suggest that SENP1 directly regulates the activation of NF-κB and cytokine production in adipocytes.<SEP>SENP1 deletion augments NEMO SUMOylation in adipocytes<SEP>Of the NF-κB components, SUMOylation of IKK subunit NEMO and NF-κB p65/RelA are thought to be critical events for the activation of IKK-NF-κB signalling. SENP2 can efficiently deSUMOylate NEMO to blunt NF-κB activation in a 293T overexpression system and SENP1 was proposed to have a similar role. To determine the role of SENP1 in pancreatic proinflammatory phenotype and NF-κB regulation, we first examined expression of SENPs in PATs. The SENPs can be divided into three families. The first family members SENP1 and SENP2 have broad specificity for the three mammalian SUMOs (SUMO1–3), while the second family (SENP3 and SENP5) and the third family (SENP6 and SENP7) prefer SUMO2/3 as substrates. We found that SENP1, but not SENP2, was abundantly expressed in mouse adipose tissues. Deletion of SENP1 had no effects on expression of other SENPs (Supplementary Fig. 6). SUMOylations of NEMO and p65/RelA were determined by co-immunoprecipitation from the denaturing adipocyte extracts with specific antibodies followed by western blotting with anti-SUMO1. No difference in p65/RelA was detected between Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 6a). However, an extra band appeared ∼70 kDa in the SENP1-aP2KO adipocyte extracts for NEMO (Fig. 6b). Increased NEMO SUMOylation in SENP1-KO adipocyte was further confirmed by overexpression of Flag-NEMO (Fig. 6c). It is reported that NEMO SUMOylation and IKK activation are enhanced by stress responses such as oxidative stress, inflammatory stimuli and DNA damage in different cell types. We observed that DNA damage agent etoposide VP16 induced phosphorylation of IKK and p65/RelA in adipocytes, and SENP1 deletion enhanced both basal and stress-induced IKK and p65/RelA activation (Fig. 6d). SENP1 deletion also enhanced both basal and stress-induced NEMO SUMOylation in adipocytes as detected by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-NEMO followed by immunoblotting with anti-SUMO1 (Fig. 6e).<SEP>It has been reported that NEMO can be SUMOylated at K277 and K309 (ref.). To determine the functional importance of SUMO modifications in regulating NF-κB signalling in adipocytes, a single (K277R or K309R) and double lysine to arginine mutants (DM) were constructed as Flag-NEMO. Wild type (WT) or mutant Flag-NEMO was then was expressed in peri-pancreatic adipocytes isolated from SENP1-aP2KO mice, and the exogenous NEMO versus endogenous NEMO was about 1:1 ratio (Fig. 6f). While phosphorylation of NF-κB p65/RelA was slightly increased by NEMO-WT, it was mildly decreased by NEMO K277R and strongly decreased by NEMO K309R or the double mutant as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 6f) and intracellular staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated p-p65/RelA (Fig. 6g,h). These data suggest that SUMO-deficient NEMO mutants (NEMO K309R and NEMO-DM) function as dominant negative forms. NF-κB-dependent cytokine expression was then determined by ELISA in the NEMO-transfected cells. NEMO mutants had similar effects on the protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines in adipocytes (Fig. 6i), supporting that SUMOylated NEMO enhances cytokine expression.<SEP>Clinical relevance of adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice<SEP>To determine whether our studies from the adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice have clinical relevance, we first investigated whether there is a correlation between SENP1 expression in adipocytes of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and human T1DM patients. The NOD mouse, a popularly used model for T1DM, developed diabetes with a late onset at the age of 14 weeks. Consistent with reports, we observed the incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the NOD mouse was 60–80% in females and 20–30% in males (Fig. 7a). Mouse strains with an adipocyte-specific deletion of SENP1 appeared more severe in hyperglycaemia and islet disruption compared with NOD mice at the same age (Fig. 7b versus Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 2). Importantly, we observed an age-dependent reduction of SENP1 expression in PATs of NOD mice (Fig. 7c), correlating with the T1DM progression in NOD mice.<SEP>We next investigated a correlation between SENP1 expression and proinflammatory cytokines in NOD model and human T1DM patients. To this end, venous blood was drawn from consenting volunteers (healthy and diabetic subjects; Supplementary Table 1). Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in T1DM patients compared with the normal cohorts (Fig. 7d). The levels of cytokines from SENP1-aP2KO at the age of 12 weeks are at similar ranges as human serum with T1DM. NOD develops diabetes as a result of Th1 dominant IFN-γ-induced insulitis and leukocyte infiltrations of the pancreatic islets. Consistently, NOD mice exhibit increased plasma IFN-γ with lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines compared with SENP1-aP2KO mice and serum from human T1DM patients (Fig. 7e versus Fig. 7d). We then tested whether serum could directly induce β-cell death and pancreatic disruption. To this end, isolated normal mouse pancreatic islets were cultured with serum collected from Ctrl, SENP1-aP2KO and NOD mice, or collected from normal human and T1DM patients. Islet structure and apoptosis was monitored by Live/Dead viability/Cytotoxicity assays. Serum from SENP1-aP2KO mice, NOD mice and human T1DM all induced disruption and pancreatic cell death (Fig. 7f,g). Taken together, our results support that SENP1-aP2KO mice is a clinically relevant model for human diabetes.<SEP>We also tested whether insulin could prevent or delay T1DM progression in SENP1-aP2KO mice. Since T1DM is an islet-reactive T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease and insulin and its precursor (pre)proinsulin are major targets of islet-reactive T cells, both in humans and in NOD mice. It has been hypothesized that that repeated subcutaneous insulin administration prevents disease by acting as a vaccination protocol potentially restoring immune tolerance. Recent data suggest that short-term subcutaneous insulin administration delays but does not prevent diabetes in NOD mice, likely by inducing a state of ‘β-cell rest' that would make β cells less vulnerable to metabolic stress, apoptosis and possibly to immune-mediated destruction. Our results indicated that prophylactic insulin therapy in SENP1-deficient mice at the age of 5 weeks for 9 weeks only partially ameliorates development of diabetes phenotypes including immune cell infiltration, β-cell apoptosis and islet disruptions (Supplementary Fig. 7A–F).<SEP>NF-κB inhibitors ameliorate diabetes progression<SEP>To establish a causative link between SENP1-dependent NF-κB activation and type 1 diabetes, SENP1-aP2KO mice were treated at the age of 5 weeks with intraperitoneal injection of NF-κB activation inhibitor II JSH-23 (2 mg kg−1 in 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) diluted with PBS) twice a week for 6 weeks. JSH-23 had no effects on body weight, blood glucose and lipid profile in the Ctrl mice. However, administration of JSH-23 in SENP1-aP2KO mice diminished SENP1 deletion-induced elevation of blood glucose (Fig. 8a) and reduction of insulin levels in blood (Fig. 8b) concomitant with attenuated islet damages (Fig. 8c). These normalized phenotypes in JSH-23-treated SENP1-aP2KO mice correlated with basal levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the PATs of these mice (Fig. 8d). No CCL5 expression in islets (Fig. 8e,f) and apoptotic β-cells (Fig. 8g) were detected in the JSH-23-treated group. These results support a critical role of SENP1-dependent NF-κB activity in T1DM progression in SENP1-aP2KO mice.<SEP>HFD augments diabetic phenotype in SENP1 deficient mice<SEP>To determine the role of the SENP1-NEMO-NF-κB-pathway in adipocyte inflammation and its link to both T1DM and T2DM, we have examined the phenotype of SENP1-aP2KO mice under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. HFD increased fat weight in all adipose depots including epididymal fat and PATs in Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 9a,b). PATs from SENP1-aP2KO exhibit 1.8-fold smaller cell sizes with 2–3-fold more cell numbers than the Ctrl adipocytes under normal chow and this phenotype was more marked under HFD (Fig. 9c), suggesting that HFD may stimulate adipogenesis in PATs of SENP1-aP2KO. PATs from SENP1-aP2KO mice expressed high levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β at the age of 7 weeks before the onset of diabetes, and these proinflammatory cytokines were higher in the PATs compared with other adipose depots (Fig. 4). HFD significantly augmented the cytokine production in PATs (Fig. 9d) and subsequent disruption of islet structures in SENP1-aP2KO (Fig. 9e). Consistently, HFD increased body weight (Fig. 9f) and accelerated hyperglycaemia with an onset at the age of 8 weeks (versus 12 weeks under chow) in SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 9g). Basal and glucose-stimulated insulin levels were significantly reduced in SENP1-aP2KO mice. Moreover, HFD caused further reduction of insulin levels in SENP1-aP2KO mice, but not in Ctrl mice (Fig. 9h–j). Although similar insulin responses were observed between SENP1-deficient mice and Ctrl under standard chow in the ITT assay, HFD significantly induced insulin resistance in Ctrl mice and more severe phenotype was observed in SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 9k,l). Moreover, liver insulin resistance, a hallmark of obesity-linked T2DM development, was detected under basal but more pronounced under HFD conditions in SENP1 knockout (KO) mice (Fig. 9m,n). Taken together, our data demonstrate that HFD augments both T1DM and T2DM phenotypes in SENP1-aP2KO mice.","Discussion<SEP>In the present study, we have employed three different adipocyte-specific Cre deleter lines (Adipoq-Cre, PdgfRα-Cre and aP2/FABP4-Cre) and demonstrated that adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice gradually develop a T1DM phenotype, including hyperglycaemia, reduced insulin secretion, glucose intolerance and weight loss. The adipocyte-specific SENP1 deletion induces NF-κB activation and NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory cytokine production in the PATs. These cytokines induce high levels of CCL5 expression in adjacent islets to recruit CCR5+ immune cells. Subsequently, the cytokines and activated immune cells, especially CD8+ and CD4+T cells, attack the pancreases, leading to the chronic destruction of the islet structures, damaged β cells, autoantibody onset and diabetes progression in the SENP1-deficient mice (Fig. 10). Local and circulating proinflammatory cytokines may serve as a mechanism to break self-tolerance and augment cytotoxic immune response in pancreases islets, contributing to the onset of T1DM. The NOD mouse is a popularly used model for T1DM and develops diabetes as a result of Th1 dominant IFN-γ-induced insulitis and leukocytic infiltrations of the pancreatic islets. Therefore, Th1 and IFN-γ play the key role in the disease onset in NOD mice, which can capture some characteristics of human T1DM, but not the whole disease progression processes. Our adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice recapitulate the evolution process of T1DM from preclinical stage to later phase of T1DM, and therefore may provide a unique model for human T1DM. Unlike NOD mice, both male and female SENP1-deficient mice exhibit similar diabetic phenotype. It is worthy to mention that adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice exhibit normal lipid profiles in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, HDL, TG and FFA upto the age of 14 weeks, suggesting that inflammation, but not lipotoxicity, induced β-cell damages contribute to diabetic phenotype in SENP1-aP2KO mice. Of note, peri-pancreatic adipocytes from SENP1-deficient mice exhibit reduced differentiation markers with a heightened proinflammatory state compared with other tissues, supporting the profound diabetic phenotype in these mice. Mechanistic studies suggest that SENP1 deletion in adipocytes causes NF-κB activation and NF-κB-dependent cytokine expression. The high SUMOylation of the NF-κB component NEMO at lysines-277/309 is the key factor in inducing NF-κB activation and cytokine expression in SENP1-deficient adipocytes. Importantly, NF-κB inhibitors ameliorate diabetes progression. Our data support that SENP1-mediated NEMO deSUMOylation in the peri-pancreatic adipocytes limits inflammatory responses and diabetes progression. It is conceivable that NEMO SUMOylation and NF-κB activation in PATs is more susceptible to alterations of SENP1 expression/activity versus other adipose depots. Alternatively, pancreas and pancreatic β-cells are more sensitive to local and systemic cytokine-mediated immune responses.<SEP>It has been reported that aP2-Cre deletion is floxed gene loci specific. The majority of studies have reported highly adipocyte-specific recombination of the aP2/Fabp4 promoter-driven Cre strain (aP2-CreBI). A couple of reports have shown variable degrees of target gene recombination in macrophages. A recent study suggested that the aP2-Cre induces recombination in the capillary endothelium in the heart and in intermyofibrillar cells in the skeletal muscle, but not in macrophages in adipose tissue. Interestingly, they have found that different floxed gene loci display differential sensitivity to Cre-mediated recombination and that different adipose depots recombine to different extents. Therefore, it is necessary that one should carefully examine the specific gene deletion in their study. We did not detect significant differences in SENP1 expression in brain, muscle and liver tissues between WT and SENP1-aP2KO mice. Therefore, the deletion of SENP1 was limited to the adipose tissues in the SENP1-aP2KO mice. Our results are consistent with a recent report. With the same aP2-Cre strain as in our study, the authors have shown that aP2-cre expression is highly specific for adipocytes, and they found no Cre-mediated target gene recombination in muscle, liver, brain, adipose stromal vascular cells or adipose macrophages.<SEP>A novel mechanistic insight from our study is the ability of SENP1 to control NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory cytokine secretion in adipocytes. It has been shown that only SENP2, but not other SENPs, can efficiently deSUMOylate NEMO and enhance NF-κB activation induced by DNA damage in a HEK 293T overexpression system. Our data indicate that SENP1 expression is sixfold higher than SENP2 in mouse adipose tissues. Moreover, our studies using siRNA knockdown, SENP1-KO adipocytes and reconstitutions of SENP1 into SENP1-KO cells clearly demonstrate that SENP1, by deSUMOylating NEMO at K277 and K309, plays a pivotal role in regulating NF-κB activation and cytokine production in adipocytes. Given that SENP1 and SENP2 are two members of SENPs with broad specificity for SUMOs, it is conceivable that SENP1 and SENP2 regulate NEMO SUMOylation and NF-κB activation in different tissues and/or cell types. Our data is in line with the report that components in SUMOylation are associated with T1DM susceptibility. Interestingly, a variant of SUMO4 (M55V) strongly associated with T1DM results in 5.5 times greater NF-κB transcriptional activity by conjugating to NF-κB inhibitor IκBα. Although a genetic mutation of SENP1 has not been identified thus far, our study suggests that reduced SENP1 expression and enhanced NF-κB activity in adipose tissues may represent a common mechanism for the role of SUMOylayion in the pathogenesis of T1DM. Of clinical significance of our current work, we observe an age-dependent reduction of SENP1 expression in PATs of the diabetic NOD mice, correlating with the diabetic progression in these mice.<SEP>Typical features of human T1DM include hyperglycaemia, cytotoxic effector cell-mediated attack on β cell, β-cell death and generation of autoantibodies. These phenotypes are evidently observed in the adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice, suggesting that SENP1 in adipocytes plays a pivotal role in preventing autoimmune diabetes. Although previous research focuses on lipid metabolism in the adipocytes, it is now recognized that adipose tissue is the largest endocrine organ that could play an important role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, to regulate immune responses. Our data demonstrate that T1DM onset in the SENP1-deficient mice is strongly associated with high levels of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by PATs, underlying a mechanistic link between peri-pancreatic adipocytes and diabetes. First, proinflammatory cytokines have direct effects on islet immunogenicity and islet β-cell survival. We show that the high concentrations of PAT-derived cytokines directly induce expression of CCL5 and other chemokines (such as CCL2, CCL21, CXCL9 and CXCL10) in adjacent pancreatic islets, chemokines responsible for recruitment of immune cells. It needs to further investigate if and how CCL5 and other chemokines directly contribute to T1DM progression. The inflammatory cytokines have direct cytotoxic effects on islet β cells. Second, proinflammatory cytokines have direct effects on various immune cell types, specifically T cells. These immune cells further release more innate inflammatory cytokines, which damage β cells and break tolerance through activation of adaptive responses. Indeed, we observe that Th1 and Th17 effector T-cell subsets expanded in SENP1-deficient mice. Third, proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic T cells triggers β-cell turnover, resulting in the release of autoantigens and endogenous ‘danger signals' capable of promoting pathologic self-antigen presentation. We observe massive apoptosis of β cells in our mouse model, accompanying with infiltrations of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Indeed, we detect IAA in the SENP1-aP2KO mice at old ages, indicative of autoimmune disease T1DM in these mice. A reduced number of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells are also observed in SENP1-deficient mice. Moreover, islet-specific autoimmune NRP-V7-positive CD8+ T cells could be detected in the pancreatic lymph nodes and the spleen of SENP1-deficient mice. Taken together, our study provides a strong mechanistic link between adipose-secreted proinflammatory cytokines and T1DM. It will be important to test whether blockade of proinflammatory cytokines or blockade of cytotoxic T cells could block T1DM pathogenesis development in the SENP1-deficient mouse model.<SEP>It worth mentioning that type-1 and type-2 diabetes are systemically linked. Specifically, the accumulation of activated innate immune cells in metabolic tissues results in release of inflammatory mediators, in particular, IL-1β and TNF-α, which promote systemic insulin resistance and β-cell damage. Our data demonstrate that SENP1-aP2KO mice have strong T1DM phenotypes concomitant with mild T2DM, which can be exacerbated by HFD. Specifically, HFD augments PAT morphological change, cytokine production and pancreatic damage in SENP1-aP2KO mice, and HFD augments hyperglycaemia and insulin reduction in SENP1-aP2KO mice. Moreover, a moderate insulin resistance in the liver of SENP1-deficient mice is observed under standard chow. However, HFD augments liver insulin resistance, a hallmark of obesity-linked T2DM development, in SENP1-aP2KO mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the increased cytokines in SENP1-aP2KO mice contribute not only to T1DM progression but also to HFD-induced T2DM phenotypes in these mice.<SEP>In summary, our experiments define the role of the SENP1-mediated protein SUMOylation in pancreatic immune responses, β-cell damages and consequently diabetes progression. Our study has provided a molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of diabetes, and may help to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetes.",59675,"['OBWCCE', 'FOODAL']"
23826116,"Introduction<SEP>Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, with an estimated 225,500 new cases and 140,200 deaths worldwide annually. Because of the low rate of early detection, the late clinical manifestation, and the lack of effective treatments, the 5-year survival rate for ovarian cancer patients is about 40%. As 85% of the ovarian cancer cases are sporadic and 15% are familial, it has been hypothesized that both genetic and environmental factors may be involved in the development of ovarian cancer. Factors including age, gravidity, tubal ligation, number of ovulatory cycles, and family history of ovarian cancer influence the ovarian cancer risk, as can lifestyle factors, including diet, physical activity, and exposure to carcinogenic chemicals.<SEP>Vitamin D is widely known for its classic roles in mineral metabolism and bone growth. Epidemiological and ecological studies have revealed the protective functions of vitamin D against ovarian, breast, colorectal, gastric, liver, prostate, and non-melanoma skin cancers. In humans, the effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1α,25-(OH)2D], the active form of vitamin D, are mainly mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). As a transcriptional regulatory factor, the VDR is expressed in cells of the normal ovarian epithelium and ovarian tumor cells. For the ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR-3, 1α,25-(OH)2D reduces the proliferation induced by dihydrotestosterone through the VDR. In ovarian cancer cells, 1α,25-(OH)2D3 leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest through a p53-independent induction of GADD45, which modulates tumor formation. Vitamin D also has pleiotropic functions in the immune, neural, and endocrine systems, all of which are involved in the regulation of tumor growth and metastasis. These data suggest that vitamin D could have preventive effects against ovarian cancer.<SEP>Since the VDR is a mediator of the vitamin D pathway, the association of VDR SNPs with ovarian cancer risk has been evaluated in various population studies. As reported for a case-control study, Caucasian T allele carriers for the variant FokI have a more than two-fold increased risk of ovarian cancer relative to homozygous CC carriers. These results are consistent with the pooled results of five population-based, case-control studies, including 1,764 cases and 3,339 controls, which were performed by the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. Nevertheless, several studies did not find such an association for FokI and risk for ovarian cancer. The variant ApaI is reportedly associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer among Caucasians but not for Japanese, and with an increased risk of ovarian cancer for African Americans but not for Caucasians. Also in epidemiological studies, inconclusive results were found for other common variants, including BsmI, Cdx-2, and TaqI.<SEP>As the epidemiological studies that evaluated association of the VDR polymorphisms with risk of ovarian cancer found inconsistent results, we performed a systematic study to evaluate, with a meta-analysis, the associations of the common variants on the VDR and risk of ovarian cancer. Only FokI, which leads to an alteration of the VDR protein structure, was significantly associated with an increased risk; other common variants (BsmI, ApaI, TaqI, and Cdx-2) were not.","Materials and Methods<SEP>Literature Search<SEP>Two investigators (YL and CL) independently searched the MEDLINE and PubMed databases for eligible articles published prior to March, 2013. The terms “ovarian cancer” and “vitamin D receptor” were used to identify studies that assessed the association between VDR polymorphisms and the risk of ovarian cancer. The reference lists of the identified publications, including reviews, were checked to identify any missing study in the electronic database search. The working flow of the literature identification is shown in Figure 1.<SEP>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria<SEP>Studies to be included in the meta-analysis were required to meet the following criteria: 1) be a population- or hospital-based, case-control study or a prospective nested case-control study; 2) provided the frequencies of the variants, FokI, BsmI, ApaI, TaqI and Cdx-2 in the VDR in the cases and controls or provided sufficient data to calculate the risk estimates for the variants; and 3) reported in the English language. If overlapping populations were identified between studies, only the most complete one was included in the meta-analysis.<SEP>Data Extraction<SEP>From each report, the following data were extracted: the last name of the first author, the publication year, the region in which the study was performed, the ethnicity of the participants, the study design (source of controls), the method used for genotyping of the polymorphisms, the sample size, and the genotype distribution for the participants.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>The pooled ORs with their 95% CIs were calculated to assess the association between polymorphisms and the risk of ovarian cancer under the additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models. The Chi-square test was used to determine if the identified study was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for the genotype distribution in the control group. The standard inverse variance weighting method was used to calculate the pooled ORs and 95% CIs under the fixed-effects model, and the DerSimonian-Laird method was used to calculate the pooled estimates under the random-effects model. The heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated with the Q-test and the I2 statistic. Heterogeneity between the studies was considered to be significant when P<0.05 for Q-tests or when I2 was more than 25%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the stability of the final results, and the influence of individual studies on the pooled estimate risk was tested by deleting each single study from the meta-analysis. Publication bias was measured by funnel plots and further evaluated with the Egger’s linear regression test. All statistical analyses were performed with R software and the Meta package for R (www.r-project.org).Two-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.","Results<SEP>Characteristics of Selected Studies<SEP>136 published reports before March, 2013 were identified in the database search. Of them, six studies met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis (Figure 1). Subgroup studies from three reports that contained more than one study subgroup were recognized as individual studies. Since the report by Lurie et al. had an overlapping population with another study, the subgroup with the smaller sample size was excluded from the analysis. A total of 4,107 cases and 6,661 controls from 11 subgroup studies that reported the association between the 5 common variants (ApaI, BsmI, Cdx-2, FokI and TaqI) and ovarian cancer risk were included in the meta-analysis. The characteristics of the identified studies are shown in Table 1.<SEP>FokI (rs2228570 or rs10735810) and Ovarian Cancer Risk<SEP>As established from the literature search, all 11 subgroup studies, with 4,107 cases and 6,661 controls, evaluated the association between FokI and risk of ovarian cancer. None of the subgroup studies departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the allele T distribution in the controls. The meta-analysis indicated that FokI was significantly associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. As determined under the fixed-effect model, the pooled OR for CT carriers was 1.10 (95% CI = 1.00–1.20) and 1.16 (95% CI = 1.03–1.31) for the TT carriers relative to CC carriers (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The dominant genetic model also suggested that carriers of the T allele were associated with an 11% increased risk for ovarian cancer (pooled OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.02–1.21). The recessive genetic model indicated that carriers of homozygote TT showed a marginal 10% increased risk of ovarian cancer compared to those of TC or CC carriers (pooled OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.99–1.22). Similar results were found under the random-effects model as no significant heterogeneity between the studies was found for any meta-analysis of the variant (Table 2). Sensitivity analysis suggested that no single subgroup study significantly affected the overall estimates of the association between FokI and ovarian cancer. The funnel plot and the Egger’s test showed no significant publication bias for the identified subgroups. When we restricted the studies that were conducted in the Caucasians (3,959 cases and 6,410 controls), we found a significant association for the allele T carriers (pooled OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.02–1.22) when compared to the homozygotes CC carriers with no significant heterogeneity between the studies were identified.<SEP>ApaI (rs7975232) and Ovarian Cancer Risk<SEP>Six subgroup studies from 3 reports, which included a total of 817 cases and 1,313 controls, evaluated the association for the variant ApaI (rs7975232) and risk for ovarian cancer (Table 1). None of the subgroup studies departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the allele G distribution in the controls. As determined with the fixed-effect model, there was no significant association for the variant and risk of ovarian cancer; relative to TT carriers, the pooled OR was 1.00 (95% CI = 0.81–1.24) for TG carriers and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.67–1.14) for GG carriers. Under the dominant genetic model, there was also no significant association for carriers of the G allele and the risk of ovarian cancer (pooled OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.79–1.18), as determined with the fixed-effect model. When we restricted to the Caucasians, no significant association for the variant and ovarian cancer risk was found (pooled OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.73–1.14; 630 cases and 991 controls). No significant heterogeneity between the studies was detected, and the Egger’s test indicated no significant publication bias for the subgroup studies (Table 2).<SEP>BsmI (rs1544410) and Ovarian Cancer Risk<SEP>Nine subgroup studies from 5 publications, including a total of 2,332 cases and 3,301 controls, concerned the association of BsmI (rs1544410) and risk of ovarian cancer. Of these, the genotype distribution in the controls from four subgroup studies, including the Japanese subgroup by Lurie et al., Northern Sweden subgroup by Clendenen et al., the New England Case-Control (NECC) subgroup by Tworoger et al., and the African American subgroup by Grant et al., was departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<0.05) as indicated by Chi-square tests. The fixed-effect model suggested no significant association between the variant and ovarian cancer risk (GA vs. GG: pooled OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.99–1.25; AA vs. GG: pooled OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.86–1.20), as under the dominant genetic model (pooled OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.97–1.22; AA/GA vs. GG). After excluding the subgroup conducted in the African American population performed by Grant et al., which contributed most to the heterogeneity between the studies, the pooled estimate suggested that carriers of the A allele showed a significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer (pooled OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.01–1.28) relative to GG carriers. No significant publication bias was found for the meta-analysis (Table 2). When we restricted the studies to Caucasians, we also found no significant association for the variant with ovarian cancer risk (pooled OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.98–1.24; 2,183 cases and 3,052 controls) with no significant heterogeneity between the studies were identified (Q = 4.94, df = 6, P = 0.551; I2 = 0%).<SEP>Cdx-2 (rs11568820) and Ovarian Cancer Risk<SEP>Two reports with 4 subgroup studies and with a total of 1,567 cases and 2,226 controls evaluated the association of Cdx-2 and ovarian cancer risk. Of these, subgroup studies conducted with a Japanese subgroup by Lurie et al. and with the NECC subgroup by Tworoger et al., were departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<0.05). With the random-effects model, the meta-analysis suggested no significant association for the variant and the risk of ovarian cancer; the pooled OR was 1.02 (95% CI = 0.75–1.38) for GA and 1.00 (95% CI = 0.74–1.35) for AA carriers relative to the common GG carriers. The dominant genetic model also indicated that the variant was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer, and no significant heterogeneity between the studies was found (Table 2). The Egger’s test found no publication bias for the meta-analysis (Table 2). When we restricted the studies to Caucasians, we found that the variant was associated with the ovarian cancer risk (pooled OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.04–1.37; 1,475 cases and 2,055 controls) with no significant heterogeneity between the studies were identified (Q = 0.16, df = 2, P = 0.922; I2 = 0%).<SEP>TaqI (rs731236) and Ovarian Cancer Risk<SEP>From the literature search, 6 subgroup studies from 3 reports that considered 784 cases and 1,248 controls evaluated the association between TaqI and risk of ovarian cancer. The Northern Sweden subgroup, performed by Clendenen et al., departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<0.05). Our meta-analysis indicated that the variant had no significant effect on the risk of ovarian cancer. The pooled OR was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.90–1.35) for TC carriers and 1.09 (95% CI = 0.82–1.45) for CC carriers relative to TT carriers. The fixed-effect model and the random-effects model found a null association for the variant and risk of ovarian cancer under the dominant genetic model (pooled OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.91–1.33). There was no significant heterogeneity between studies included in the meta-analysis. However, there was a marginal publication bias under the dominant genetic model (P = 0.04, Table 2). Sensitivity tests showed that no single study greatly influenced the estimates of overall risk. When restricted the studies performed in the Caucasians, we also noticed no significant association between the variant and the ovarian cancer (pooled OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.91–1.39; 636 cases and 996 controls).","Discussion<SEP>The present meta-analysis evaluated the association of five common VDR polymorphisms (ApaI, BsmI, Cdx-2, FokI and TaqI) and the risk of ovarian cancer. The variant FokI on the VDR was associated with the risk of ovarian cancer, but there was no significant association for the other four variants. The data suggest that a dysfunction of vitamin D and its downstream signaling pathways are involved in the development of ovarian cancer.<SEP>FokI, located at the translation start site of the VDR gene, results in alteration of the VDR protein sequence, which is three amino acids longer for carriers of the T (also known as the f allele for FokI) allele than for carriers of the C allele (also known as the F allele for FokI). As determined by epidemiological studies, the variant may affect the susceptibility to a variety of cancers. In a previous meta-analysis, populations with FokI f allele were associated with a 14% increased risk (pooled OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03–1.27) of breast cancer and a 30% increased risk (pooled OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.04–1.61) of skin cancer; however, there was no significant association of the variant and prostate or colorectal cancer. Another meta-analysis performed by Yin et al. updated the epidemiological studies with a total of 6,736 cases and 7,325 controls found that FokI was not significantly associated with risk for prostate cancer; however, under the dominant genetic model, there was an increased risk of prostate cancer in Caucasians (pooled OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.00–1.17). Thus, the altered biological activities of this VDR variant may lead to susceptibility to various types of cancer. For the current study, we have included a total of 4,107 cases and 6,661 controls from 6 eligibility studies and found that allele T confer an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The data suggested that dysfunction of vitamin D signaling pathways may be involved in the ovarian cancer carcinogenesis. As the FokI T allele results in three amino acids longer VDR protein than the C allele, it has been reported that the longer VDR protein is less responsive to 1α,25-(OH)2D and has lower transcription activity. Carriers of the T allele may have a lower response ability for the protective effects of vitamin D. Previous studies suggested that the variant could modify the transcriptional factor activities of VDR on various target genes including genes involved in the immune system such as NF-kB and AP-1. Etten et al. reported that longer VDR (allele T or F carriers) resulted in a lower NF-kB transcriptional activation and further leaded to a reduced IL-12 expression and weaker immunity responses. It was widely accepted that the immune system play an important roles in ovarian cancer development and progression. The C to T transition leads to longer VDR protein may be resulted in the reduced immunity response, which may be contributed to the ovarian cancer susceptibility.<SEP>Located at the 3′-UTR of the VDR gene, BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232), and TaqI (rs731236) are SNPs that are linked with each other with high linkage disequilibrium. These SNPs do not affect the VDR protein structure but may affect the stability of VDR mRNA or may be in high linkage disequilibrium with other functional SNPs. As determined in a larger population based case-control study, the BsmI B allele was significantly associated with an increased risk of melanoma; however, the results were different from previous meta-analyses, which suggested that the B allele was a protective factor for melanoma. BsmI was significantly associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer in a meta-analysis that included 10,083 cases and 11,242 controls (pooled OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.80–0.94 for BB vs. bb; pooled OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.84–0.97 for BB vs. Bb/bb), indicating a protective effect of the B allele. There was also a reduced risk of prostate cancer for carriers of the B allele of BsmI (pooled OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.69–0.99). TaqI was reported to be associated with risk of prostate cancer by Yin et al., based on case-control study including 4,054 cases and 5,069 controls. A recent meta-analysis conducted by Bai et al., however, did not find a significant association for TaqI and risk of colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, variant ApaI was significantly associated with risk of colorectal cancer. Our meta-analysis found no significant association for these three variants and risk of ovarian cancer. The inconsistent results from the epidemiological studies regarding the associations of the variants with risk of different cancers could be due to different genetic backgrounds of the cancers or to different modes of action of vitamin D between tissues. 1α,25-(OH)2D influences gene transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences of the gene promoter, which are promoter-specific and cell-specific. The variability in DNA-responsive sequences, VDR isoforms, cell-specific phosphorylations, and co-regulators in different tissues could alter the binding capacity of the VDR for its target sequences. Moreover, different VDR-DNA complexes could lead to conformation changes of the VDR and result in specific interactions with cell-specific transcription factors. These could be the underlying mechanisms for the cell-specific functions of 1α,25-(OH)2D and could lead to diverse associations between the VDR polymorphisms and the risk of cancer of different tissues.<SEP>In the case of Cdx-2, which is located in the promoter region of the VDR gene, a G to A sequence variation affects the binding of this intestinal-specific transcription factor CDX. The A allele is more active by binding to the transcription factor, resulting in greater transcription activity. Bai et al. did not find a significant association for the variant and colorectal cancer risk based on a meta-analysis based on 2,639 cases and 2,939 controls. Yin et al. also found a null association between Cdx-2 and risk of prostate cancer with a case-control study including 2,058 cases and 2,128 controls. These results are consistent with a report by John et al.. We found no significant association for the variant and ovarian cancer risk for the pooled estimate of overall studies; however, when we restricted the studies to Caucasians, a significant increased risk was found for the allele A carriers (pooled OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.04–1.37) indicated that the variant could be a risk factor for ovarian cancer. It should be noticed that data regarding the association for Cdx-2 and ovarian cancer risk are limited; more studies are warranted to reveal the biological implications of this variant on cancer risk.<SEP>For the current meta-analysis, several limitations should be taken into consideration. First, most of the patients were Caucasians, which may limit the general application of our results. Second, the sample size was relatively small, and all data were from case-control studies. The null association for the variants, BsmI, ApaI, TaqI, and Cdx-2, could be due to the small sample size, which provides low statistical power to detect the association for the variants. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to obtain more reliable results. Third, we were not able to take into consideration other factors, such as circulating vitamin D levels, outdoor activity, sun exposure, disease stage, and vitamin D and calcium intake, that may modify the association of VDR variants and risk of ovarian cancer. It is possible that the interactions between VDR polymorphisms and these factors are involved in the development of ovarian cancer, and the association for the variants and risk of ovarian cancer may be modified by these factors. Finally, several subgroup studies departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<0.05), which may have led to a bias for the overall estimates of the meta-analysis.<SEP>In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicates that FokI is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer and that the VDR can be a preventive target for ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, more studies are warranted to confirm the results and to establish the underlying molecular mechanisms that are involved.",22219,['VITMIN']
27502545,"Vitamin D is an important modulator of the immune system. This molecule is involved in both the innate and adaptive responses acting on a wide spectrum of immune cells, in which the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed. VDR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Binding of this molecule with the activated form of Vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) causes its dimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR), which control the transcription of specific genes by interacting with the RNA polymerase II.<SEP>Chagas disease represents an infectious condition caused by the flagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi that currently affects around 6 million people in Latin America. Although infected people do not usually develop further complications after the acute phase of disease, up to one third will suffer from chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) a condition that affects the life quality and could lead to premature death. The exact causes of the differential disease outcomes are largely unknown, but increasing knowledge suggests that immune gene variants could play a relevant role by influencing the adequate inflammatory response against the parasitic invasion. Consistent with this, several members of the inflammatory pathway have been recently associated with risk of infection by T. cruzi and/or development of CCC, including genes encoding for HLA class-II molecules (DRB1 and DQB1), the chemokine receptor CCR5, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and the interleukins IL-1, IL-12B, IL-17A, IL-18, among others.<SEP>Due to the high relevance of Vitamin D and its receptor in the immune homeostasis, several studies have investigated the possible influence of genes involved in their metabolism in the development of autoimmune conditions and infectious diseases. In this regard, some polymorphisms of the VDR gene have been reported to be associated with different outcomes in autoimmune and infectious diseases, especially in tuberculosis.<SEP>Taking the above into consideration, we aimed to explore for the first time the possible implication of VDR genetic variation in Chagas disease susceptibility and clinical manifestation.","Material and Methods<SEP>Study subjects<SEP>For this study, 1,172 individuals from the endemic regions for T. cruzi Guanentina and Comunera at the Santander Department, Colombia (localized between 5°26′ and 8°08′ north and 72°26′ and 74°32′ west) (Supplementary Figure S1) were enrolled. These provinces are located on the north-east side of the country, and their population is a homogeneous mix with no specific concentration of any ethnicity. Regarding the selection criteria, participants were recruited either after a medical visit to the endemic area or after attending to “Fundación Cardiovascular de Colombia”, a medical institution specialized in cardiovascular disorders situated in the city of Floridablanca (Supplementary Figure S1), where they were diagnosed with Chagas disease. Almost all invited individuals agreed to participate in this study. Since Chagas disease is a chronical disorder in which symptoms may appear after several years of infection, we decided to exclude those individuals younger than 30 years old (189 in total) in order to perform a more consistent analysis of possible resistance to the infection (as the selected individuals had a longer time of exposure to vectorial infection). In total, 983 individuals were finally included in the analyses. Then, the individuals were classified as seronegative or seropositive (n = 436 and 547, respectively) for T. cruzi antigens accordingly to two different commercial immunological tests, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (BioELISA Chagas, Biokit, Lliçà d’Amunt, Barcelona, Spain) and indirect hemagglutination (Chagatest IHA, Wiener Lab, Rosario, Argentina). All seronegative individuals were negative for both tests. Seropositive patients underwent an exhaustive clinical evaluation and were subsequently subdivided into asymptomatic and chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) patients (n = 171 and 376, respectively) based on electrocardiogram and echocardiogram information. This classification is based in the guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs340/en/), the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) (http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=10&Itemid=40743), and the classification established by the international consensus of Buenos Aires of 2010 (http://www.fac.org.ar/7cvc/llave/c016/mordinio.pdf). The mean age of participants was 52.11 years for seronegative individuals, 56.67 for asymptomatic individuals and 62.66 for CCC patients. The sex distribution for the entire group was 55% female and 45% male.<SEP>Ethics statement<SEP>All participants signed an informed consent. This study was approved by the Act No. 15 of 2005 by the Ethics Committees from “Universidad Industrial de Santander” and “Fundación Cardiovascular de Colombia” in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.<SEP>SNP selection<SEP>Following a candidate gene strategy, four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VDR gene, previously described to have a functional implication on gene expression and function, were selected for this study. These variants include rs731236 (Taq1), rs7975232 (Apa1), rs1544410 (Bsm1), and rs2228570 (Fok1). The three first SNPs have been related to a differential expression of VDR in different cells, whereas the latter represents a cytosine to thymine change in an ACG codon, which creates an alternative start site that produces a longer VDR protein with a reduced transcriptional activity.<SEP>DNA extraction and Genotyping<SEP>Genomic DNA was isolated from 5–10 ml of EDTA anticoagulated blood samples using standard salting-out techniques as previously described. The four SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, California, USA; catalog numbers: C___2404008_10, C__28977635_10, C___8716062_10, C__12060045_20). The genotyping was performed on a LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>All the statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software package Plink V1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink). For all groups of individuals, possible deviance from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was determined in every SNP at the 1% significance level. To test for possible allelic and genotypic associations with disease susceptibility and clinical complications, we compared the allelic, genotypic and haplotypic frequencies of the VDR variants between seronegative vs. seropositive individuals and asymptomatic vs. CCC individuals by logistic regression assuming an additive model and using age as covariate (as in Chagas disease symptoms may appear many years after infection). The Benjamini & Hochberg step-up false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used in all analyses to control for possible multiple testing effects. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated according to Woolf’s method. P-values lower than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D’ and r2) and haplotypic blocks were estimated using an expectation–maximization algorithm as implemented in Haploview v4.2. The statistical power of our study was calculated with the Power Calculator for Genetic Studies 2006 (CaTS) software (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/CaTS/).<SEP>Additional Information<SEP>How to cite this article: Leon Rodriguez D. A. et al. Evaluation of VDR gene polymorphisms in Trypanosoma cruzi infection and chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy. Sci. Rep. 6, 31263; doi: 10.1038/srep31263 (2016).","Results<SEP>The genotype frequencies of the four analyzed VDR variants did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the different subsets (P > 0.01), and their genotyping success rate was over 95%. The statistical power of this study is detailed in Table 1. The SNPs rs731236, rs7975232 and rs1544410 showed a relatively high LD in our study population (Fig. 1). Particularly, rs731236 and rs1544410 had an r2 value = 0.93. On the contrary, rs2228570 had an r2 value <0.10 with the other SNPs.<SEP>First, to analyze the possible implication of the VDR polymorphisms in the susceptibility to infection by T. cruzi, the allelic and genotypic frequencies of seronegative and seropositive individuals were compared (Table 2). No statistical significance was observed for rs731236, rs7975232 and rs1544410, indicating that these variants may not influence the risk of infection by T. cruzi in the studied population. On the other hand, the allele frequencies of rs2228570 differed significantly between the seronegative and seropositive groups (P = 0.0287, OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.67−0.98). The minor allele rs2228570*A was overrepresented in the seronegative subset (45.41% vs. 39.94%), suggesting a possible protective effect of this variant against infection by T. cruzi. However, the statistical significance was lost after correction for multiple testing (P = 0.1147).<SEP>Next, we evaluated the possible association between the VDR SNPs and the susceptibility to develop CCC. For that, we compared the allelic and genotypic frequencies of asymptomatic and CCC patients (Table 3). Similar to that observed in the previous analysis, no differences in the allele frequencies of both subgroups of patients were observed for the analyzed SNPs except for rs2228570 (P = 4.46E−03, OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.14−2.00). This association was maintained after controlling for multiple testing (P = 0.0178). In this case, the frequency of the rs2228570*A allele was reduced in the asymptomatic patients (34.41% vs. 42.47%), suggesting a putative protective role of this variant against CCC development.<SEP>On the other hand, a possible haplotypic effect of the studied VDR SNPs was also tested. Due to the high LD in this population (Fig. 1), only three haplotypes were observed in the studied individuals (rs731236|rs7975232|rs1544410: ACC, GAT and AAC). No evidence of association was observed for any haplotype in the different tests performed (seronegative vs. seropositive and asymptomatic vs. CCC, data not shown).","Discussion<SEP>In this study, four genetic variants of the VDR gene were tested for association with risk of infection by T. cruzi and/or development of CCC in a population from a Colombian endemic region of Chagas disease. Our data provides strong evidence that the VDR SNP rs2228570 is associated with CCC in infected individuals, as the odds of having the minor allele was significantly increased in symptomatic individuals as compared to asymptomatic patients. This polymorphism is located at the 5′ end of the VDR coding sequence. It has been reported that the presence of the minor allele originates an alternative starting transcription site, which leads to a longer isoform with a reduced transcription activity. Therefore, it has been proposed that the rs2228570 variant may affect the responsiveness to vitamin D.<SEP>Vitamin D is a key molecule of the immune system. The active form of this compound seems to potentiate phagocytosis by macrophages and the production of antimicrobial peptides. Additionally, it has been observed that it shifts the immune response from TH1/TH17 towards TH2 by inhibiting the production of IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-21, among other cytokines. In Chagas disease, the infection by T. cruzi causes a coordinated immune response. That is, in the first line of defense, the innate response is initiated by dendritic cells and macrophages, which produce IL-12 and TNF-α after recognizing the parasite. These cytokines activate natural killer cells that, in turn, enhance the production on IFN-γ. As a consequence, the parasite clearance is facilitated by shifting to a TH1 dominant response that controls the infection. Hence, proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-17 and TNF-α, are essential for controlling the parasite. In addition, several studies have suggested that the persistence of T. cruzi in the organism is directly related to the development of severe complications in Chagas disease. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that a stronger immune response may protect patients against the persistence of the parasite. Our data showed that the rs2228570*A allele, which allows the transcription of the enlarged VDR isoform, is more prevalent in CCC patients compared with asymptomatic individuals. We speculate that vitamin D could influence the inflammatory response against T. cruzi by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-17. As a consequence, the parasitic persistence could be favored thus increasing the predisposition to develop cardiac complications in Chagas patients. The analysis of vitamin D profiles in individuals exposed to T. cruzi infection with different degrees of cardiac involvement would shed light into this idea.<SEP>On the other hand, the frequency of the VDR allele rs2228570*A was increased in the seronegative group compared to the seropositive one. In principle, this may be contradictory to the above, as a more potent innate response should lead to a quicker clearance of the parasite in infected individuals before the production of antibodies. However, the statistical significance of this result was lost after correction for multiple testing, which indicates a lack of consistency of this putative association. Further analyses in larger populations are required to clarify this issue.<SEP>The role of vitamin D in other protozoan infections is not clear. In malaria, for instance, two different studies indicated that this molecule plays an important role in the control of the immune pathogenesis and cerebral malaria. Vitamin D was observed to reduce the risk of cerebral malaria in mice, thus suggesting that it may attenuate the inflammatory response leading to an increase of survival rates. However, evidences also point to vitamin D deficiency as directly responsible for severe cerebral malaria in children coming from Uganda. To our knowledge, only one study has evaluated the possible association between VDR genetic variation and malaria. Specifically, two VDR SNPs, rs731236 and rs1544410, were shown to affect gametocytemia levels in individuals infected with Plasmodium vivax. In Leishmania, two different studies indicated that suppression of both vitamin D and VDR in mice favor the parasite eradication in a TH1 dependent manner, supporting our hypothesis that vitamin D likely promotes parasite clearance in Chagas.<SEP>Regarding the study of VDR gene polymorphisms in other infectious diseases, rs2228570 has been associated with tuberculosis in populations of different ethnicities, although the results are contradictory. For instance, a meta-analysis and a case/control study showed that the rs2228570*A allele conferred risk to this condition in Chinese and Iranian patients, respectively. However, other studies reported associations of this same allele with protection against pulmonary tuberculosis in a Moroccan population. VDR rs2228570 has been evaluated also in leprosy, an infectious disease caused by another species of Mycobacterium. In this case, homozygosity of rs2228570*A was associated with a higher risk to develop leprosy in an Indian population.<SEP>Thus, it seems clear that the vitamin D signaling has a major role in the immune response against different infectious diseases, and this has led to propose that controlling the uptake and metabolic status of vitamin D may be useful to improve the current therapeutic strategies in these conditions. Consequently, future studies aimed to analyze the levels of vitamin D in the different groups of individuals included in this study, could represent an important step forward towards the understanding of Chagas disease development and treatment. Replication of the genetic results reported here in larger independent cohorts would be also desirable to confirm our findings.<SEP>In conclusion, we have observed a genetic association between the VDR gene polymorphism rs2228570 and risk to develop CCC in Chagas patients. Although this association has a clear functional implication, more powered studies and functional experiments are needed to definitively confirm the involvement of the vitamin D signaling in the development of this severe complication after infection by T. cruzi.",16608,['VITMIN']
34504685,"Introduction<SEP>Herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) or disc herniation is the most common spinal degenerative disease associated with lower back pain and radicular pain of the lower extremities due to nerve compression.  HNP is also the most common cause of persistent sciatic pain due to displacement of the nucleus pulposus beyond the intravertebral disc space.  The most prevalent HNP locations are between the L4 and L5 vertebrae and between the L5 and S1 vertebrae  whilst the highest incidence is observed amongst people aged 30-50 years old.  Diabetes,  smoking, ,  obesity, -  type of occupation,  age,  and gender ,  have all been associated with a high risk of developing disc degenerative diseases. However, it has been suggested that genetic factors also play a vital role in susceptibility to disc degenerative diseases. A study showed that individuals aged younger than 30 years who have a family history of disc herniation have a 14.5 times higher risk of developing disc protrusion than individuals who have no family history.  Family history is also attributed to a 5.1 times higher risk of disc herniation in people aged between 30-50 years old.  The Twin Spine Study found that heredity substantially influences disc degeneration by 43-77%. ,  <SEP>The intervertebral disc (IVD) consists of two different components: the nucleus pulposus (NP) and the annulus fibrosus (AF),  where proteoglycans (mostly found in NP) acts as an internal semi-fluid mass and collagen (mostly found in AF) acts as a laminar fibrous container.  Genes encoding components of IVD such as collagens I,  collagens IX,  collagens XI,  aggrecan,  cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP),  and vitamin D receptor (VDR)  have previously been studied to determine susceptibility to lumbar disc diseases. Other factors such as increased production of extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes (encoded by matrix metalloproteinase 3 gene ( MMP-3) and MMP-9  and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1A), IL-18,  IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) ) are commonly found in disc degeneration. Excessive synthesis, secretion, and biological activity of these inflammatory mediators are associated with tissue destruction and are therefore commonly found in inflammatory disorders including disc degeneration.  <SEP>One of the mechanisms that alters the production of protein mediators in the human body are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These genetic variations, single nucleotide changes at specific positions in a gene, may influence gene expression and hence associate to particular disease. A three-fold increase in susceptibility of disc degeneration was observed in individuals with a TT genotype compared to those without the allele (CC genotype) on SNP IL-1A -889C>T (rs1800587).  People with minor allele of IL-1A -889C>T (T allele) also had a 2.4-fold increased risk of disc bulges  and a 2.5-fold increased risk of endplate modic change.  A study in an Iranian population found that among nine SNPs on pro-inflammatory cytokine genes ( IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-A), no association to IVD degeneration was found except for two SNPs in the TNF-A gene ( TNF-A−308 G/A and TNF-A −238 G/A).  TNF-α plays important role in the pathophysiology of HNP such as upregulating the activity and the gene expression of MMP, stimulating other cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, stimulating cell migration, altering endothelial permeability, and decreasing the synthesis of collagen and proteoglycan.  A study reported that G allele and GG genotype of TNF-A 238G>A (rs361525) were 2.51 times and 2.98 times, respectively, more prevalent in patients with HNP compared to healthy controls.  <SEP>Several roles of VDR such as regulating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, bone mineralization and remodeling, and matrix production have previously been demonstrated.  VDR's role in spinal degenerative disorder has been studied in Italian,  Turkish,  and Southern European populations.  A study in a Chinese population suggested that subjects with the t allele of VDR TaqI (rs731236) had a 2.61 times higher risk to have degenerative disc disease.  Moreover, individuals aged younger than 40 years who had the t allele were almost six times more likely to develop disc degeneration and 7.17 times more likely to develop disc bulge compared to those without the t allele.  However, studies in Danish  and Mexican populations  contradict previous results suggesting a role of VDR TaqI in disc degenerative disease. This conflicting role of SNPs in IL-1A, TNF-A and VDR on HNP therefore needs to be further evaluated. This study sought to determine the association of IL-1A -889C>T (rs1800587), TNF-A 238G>A (rs361525), and VDR TaqI (rs731236) in susceptibility to HNP.","Methods<SEP>Study design and protocol<SEP>A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the association of three SNPs, IL-1A (rs1800587), TNF-A (rs361525), and VDR (rs731236), on susceptibility to HNP. The outcome variable of this study was the risk or susceptivity to have HNP while the response variables were the SNPs in three genes: IL-1A (rs1800587), TNF-A (rs361525), and VDR (rs731236). We searched databases for relevant studies, then extracted and analyzed data from those studies to achieve the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) using a random or fixed effect model depending on the data. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. ,  The protocol of this study has been registered in  (reg. number CRD42021249187).<SEP>Literature search strategy<SEP>The literature searches were conducted on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science. The searches were conducted using the keywords:‘degenerative disc disease’ AND (‘IL-1A’ OR ‘rs1800587’ OR ‘-889C>T’) OR (‘TNF-A’ OR ‘rs361525’ OR ‘-238G>A’) OR (‘VDR’ OR ‘rs731236’ OR ‘TaqI’) AND ‘gene polymorphism’, including all results up to April 1 st, 2021. The keywords were adapted from Medical Subject Heading (MeSH). Additional studies were also retrieved from the references of relevant papers. If two or more studies with the same study data were identified, the most recent study was used. The processes were conducted by three independent authors (JKF, MI, HAM).<SEP>Study eligibility<SEP>To be eligible for the meta-analysis, a study had to meet all the inclusion criteria below: ( ) the study design should be case-control, cross-sectional, or cohort design; ( ) the study should evaluate the association of IL-1 (rs1800587), TNF-A (rs361525), or VDR (rs731236) on HNP and have case and control groups; and ( ) studies should present genotype frequency or minor allele frequency (MAF). All studies with duplicate records, poor quality or which had deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) were excluded.  <SEP>Data extraction<SEP>Important information from the studies such as first author name, year of publication, names of targeted gene and the SNP, genotype frequency, or MAF from case and control groups were collected. The allele frequency and MAF were recalculated using Mendel’s law. Data extraction processes were conducted by three independent authors (JKF, MI, HAM) and consensus established together with senior authors (AA, HH) if discrepancies were found.<SEP>Quality assessment<SEP>The quality of the included studies was evaluated using Newcastle-Ottawa Score (NOS)  by three independent authors (JKF, MI, HAM). This evaluation was conducted to ensure the quality of three fundamental methodological parameters of the studies: patient selection (four points), comparability of the groups (two points), and ascertainment of exposure (three points); NOS ranged from 0 to 9. Each study was then categorized based on the NOS: (1) good quality (NOS ≥ 7); (2) moderate quality (NOS ≥ 5); or (3) poor quality (NOS < 5). Consensus was established if discrepancies were found.<SEP>Covariates and sub-group analysis<SEP>The outcome measure in our study was the incidence of HNP while the predictor covariates were the gene polymorphisms of IL-1A (rs1800587), TNF-A (rs361525), and VDR (rs731236). All genetic models were applied to describe the role of each gene variant in the pathogenesis of HNP. For IL-1A (rs1800587), the allele models were C vs. T and T vs. C; and the genotype models were CC vs. CT + TT, CT vs. CC + TT, and TT vs. CC + CT. For TNF-A (rs361525), the allele models were G vs. A and A vs. G; and the genotype models were GG vs. GA + AA, GA vs. GG + AA, and AA vs. GG + GA. For VDR (rs731236), the allele models were T vs. C and C vs. T; and the genotype models were TT vs. TC + CC, TC vs. TT + CC, and CC vs. TT + TC.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>To assess the association of IL-1A (rs1800587), TNF-A (rs361525), and VDR (rs731236) on HNP, a Z-test was employed. The Egger test was used to evaluate the publication bias and a p < 0.05 indicated the possibility of publication bias in each calculated result. The Q test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity and decide between random and fixed-effect models for OR calculation. If heterogeneity was indicated (p-value less than 0.10), the random effect model was used; otherwise, the fixed-effect model was used. All analyses were performed using ‘meta’,  ’ metafor’,  and ‘dmetar’  packages in .  ","Results<SEP>Study eligibility results<SEP>The literature searches yielded 3,199 articles of which 3,067 references were retained after removing duplicates. Screening of the titles and abstracts excluded 2,965 articles as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. After a further screening of full text, an additional 90 studies were excluded due to lack of relevance (n = 90), incomplete data (n = 5), and HWE deviation (n = 6) ( Figure 1). 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis: three studies for IL-1A (rs1800587), , ,  two studies for TNF-A (rs361525), ,  and nine studies for VDR (rs731236). , , -  The summary of studies included in the meta-analysis is presented in Table 1.<SEP>Distribution of allele and genotype frequency of IL-1A -889C>T, TNF-A 238G>A and VDR TaqI <SEP>Our data indicated that the TT genotype of IL-1A -889C>T was 1.37 more frequent in HNP patients than in controls, while the distribution of alleles and other genotypes were similar between patients and healthy controls. CT genotype and T allele of TNF-A 238G>A were both 1.6 times more frequent in healthy controls than in HNP cases. No difference in the distribution of alleles or genotypes between HNP and controls was observed in VDR TaqI ( Table 1 ).<SEP>Association between alleles and genotypes of IL-1A, TNF-A, and VDR polymorphism and HNP<SEP>Our pooled estimates suggested that no IL-1A -889C>T genotypes were associated with the risk of HNPs with CC vs. CT+TT (OR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.62, 1.09), CT vs. CC+TT (OR: 0.07; 95%CI: 0.81, 1.42), and TT vs. CT+CC (OR: 1.20; 95%CI: 0.13, 11.37) ( Table 2 and Figure 2). The pooled data also suggested that allele frequency of IL-1A -889C>T had no significant association with the susceptibility to HNP with OR: 0.83; 95%CI: 0.67, 1.02 for C allele compared to T allele.<SEP>Pooled estimates for allele and genotype distribution of the TNF-A 238G>A also had no significant association with the risk for HNP. No association was observed between genotype models and the risk of HNP: GG vs. GA+AA (OR: 1.60; 95%CI: 0.00, 12882.74), GA vs. GG+AA (OR: 0.63; 95%CI: 0.00, 4211.31), and AA vs. GG+GA (OR: 1.34; 95%CI: 0.16, 6712.96) ( Table 2 and Figure 3). Distribution of the allele also had no strong association with HNP susceptibility.<SEP>Our estimates for genotypes of VDR TaqI (rs731236) suggested that none of the genotypes were associated with susceptibility to degenerative disc disease HNP with OR: 2.65; 95%CI: 0.60, 11.85 for TT vs. TC+CC, OR: 1.01; 95%CI: 0.55, 1.85 for TC vs. TT+CC and OR: 0.94; 95%CI: 0.69, 1.28 ( Table 2 and Figure 4). None of the alleles of VDR TaqI (rs731236) were associated with HNP; people with T allele had OD 1.06 with 95%CI: 0.91, 1.22 for HNP.","Discussion<SEP>Our present failed to clarify the role of IL-1A (rs1800587), TNF-A (rs361525), and VDR (rs731236) on the pathogenesis of HNP. To the best of our knowledge, our current study is the first study providing the holistic gene polymorphism in the case of HNP. Therefore, the comprehensive comparison in the context of methodological quality between our study and previous studies was unable to perform. The role of gene polymorphism of IL-1A (rs1800587) was rarely reported. Studies found that IL-1A (rs1800587) has no association with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis.  ,  Another study also found no association between TNF-A gene variants and the risk of bone-joint and spinal tuberculosis.  Furthermore, a study assessing the role of VDR gene polymorphism in the case of osteoarthritis also failed to show the potential contribution of VDR gene variant in the development of osteoarthritis.  These evidences suggested that, while theoretically the gene variants of IL-A, TNF-A, and VDR may contribute to the development of bone diseases, the evidence reveals otherwise. For the negative findings of our study, several possible reasons might be proposed. First, HNP is a complex disease and is cause by multiple factors. Thus, no single factor such as a single SNP is responsible for the whole pathogenesis. Second, large variations in the number of samples or allele frequencies among studies in our meta-analysis also contribute to the findings. This probably relates to differences in populations where study data were collected. Finally, the small number of samples significantly influenced the results of our meta-analysis. Therefore, studies with larger sample sizes and sub-analyses for different populations such as Asian, Caucasian, and other populations are warranted whenever more data are available.<SEP>HNP occurs when the central part of the intervertebral disc, the nucleus pulposus, herniates through the surrounding part of the disc, the annulus fibrosus. The damage to the annulus fibrosus resulting in the herniated disc may be associated with factors such as gender, age, certain activities such as lifting of weights and carrying, and being overweight.  For example, the degeneration of disc organization could occur during aging as the regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), a major component of the disc, is damaged during the aging process.  The herniated disc or HNP may occur as a result of several pathological mechanisms. Those mechanisms ultimately cause imbalances in disc composition that are directly linked to the quality of the ECM.  Therefore, the balance between the ECM and its degrading enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), seems to be the key to maintaining normal disc function. Interestingly, of several mechanical pathways, the regulation of the ECM and the MMPs could also be determined by the occurrence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes responsible for ECM regulation as explained below.  <SEP>Two major structural proteins that are important in the matrix structure of the disc are collagen and proteoglycan.  The main proteoglycan found in the normal intervertebral disc is aggrecan.  Although both annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus are mainly composed of water, proteoglycan, and collagen, the level of those contents differ between the structures. The annulus fibrosus consists of 70% water, 15% collagen, and 5% proteoglycan, while the composition in the nucleus pulposus is 77% water, 4% collagen, and 14% proteoglycan.  Any event causing disturbances in those ratios and/or in synthesis and/or degradation of those structural proteins could lead to herniated disc problems. For example, hypoxic and acidic conditions could repress the synthesis of the matrix leading to the dysfunctionalities of the cells of the disc. ,  <SEP>The role of inflammation in predisposing the disc to damage has also been revealed. Specifically, proinflammatory cytokines are found to play a specific role in herniated and degenerated discs. , -  A controlled immunohistochemical study observed the accumulation of inflammatory cells, mainly macrophages, in herniated disc cells indicating the role of proinflammatory cytokines in the disease.  For example, IL-1β could induce the annulus fibrosus to generate inflammatory factors leading to the impairment of proteoglycan aggregation.  Another cytokine, TNF-α, is also involved in the development of intervertebral disc problems.  However, it seems that its effect is less significant than IL-1.  This finding may be related to its relatively lower expression compared to IL-1 in the normal and healthy disc. ,  <SEP>Penetration of those inflammatory cells or proteins could be caused by matrix loss. In normal conditions, aggrecan should prevent the penetration of various compounds, especially serum proteins and cytokines.  Therefore, in addition to its pivotal role in maintaining sufficient hydration to the disc, proteoglycan loss could stimulate the movement of cytokines towards the disc activating the inflammation cascade.  <SEP>One of the mechanisms by which the proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α and TNF-α, generate problems in the intervertebral disc is related to their effect on inducing MMP production. -  The exaggerated activity of MMPs causes excessive degradation of collagen and proteoglycan.  Another mechanism is associated with the activity of the cytokines in inhibiting tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) which are responsible for terminating the action of MMPs.  Taken together, those actions ultimately impair disc functionality.<SEP>As the normal intervertebral disc is relatively avascular and aneural,  the nutritional supply to the disc depends on the ability of the nutrients to diffuse from the closest vascularized structure outside the disc which are the vertebral bodies.  The nutrients then penetrate the cartilaginous endplate and finally reach the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus. ,  Accordingly, calcification of the endplate would diminish diffusion of vital nutrients, leading to the death of the disc cells.  Therefore, VDR plays a critical role as this ligand-dependent transcription factor is involved in regulating calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization in the body, including in the intervertebral disc. ,  It has been known that genetic polymorphisms occurring in genes encoding VDR are associated with intervertebral disc problems,  including herniated disc.<SEP>Our current study had several limitations. First, the pertinent confounding factors that might affect the final findings of our study were not included in analysis, such as mechanical and behavioral factors and the levels of proteoglycans. Second, since the included articles in our current study were non-randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the final findings might have the higher risk of bias. Therefore, the up-coming meta-analysis was expected to involve only RCTs studies. Third, the limited reports on the context of gene polymorphism in HNP had made our study included the limited number of studies. Therefore, our findings should be interpreted with caution.<SEP>In conclusion, our results suggest that well-regulated IL-1A, TNF-A, and VDR are important for normal intervertebral discs and that dysregulation of these could negatively affect the intervertebral discs. Some individual studies found that SNPs in IL-1A (rs1800587), TNF-A (rs361525), and VDR (rs731236) were associated with the susceptibility to HNP, however, our meta-analysis suggested that the effects are not robust.",19680,['VITMIN']
33347560,"Background<SEP>Low birthweight is not only associated with lower infant survival, but also increased future risk of chronic diseases in offspring such as type two diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis provides an explanation for these robust observational associations, stipulating that impaired fetal growth and development in utero lead to developmental compensations that programme the offspring to increased risk of disease in later life. In other words, maternal under- or overnutrition during pregnancy not only exerts detrimental effects on offspring birthweight, but is hypothesized to cause long-term effects on the cardiometabolic health of the offspring. Therefore, identifying causal relationships between maternal nutrition and offspring birthweight could provide information on modifiable maternal exposures to ensure that more babies are born within a healthy weight range.<SEP>Low maternal folate (vitamin B9) and vitamin B12 levels have previously been linked with low offspring birthweight and increased risk of preterm birth. The combination of high folate and low vitamin B12 levels has also been associated with low birthweight. However, the association between B12 levels and offspring birthweight has been questioned, with a systematic review and meta-analysis showing no evidence for an association [5.1 g change in birthweight per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in B12 levels (95% confidence interval: −10.9 g, 21.0 g)]. For folate, data from a meta-analysis suggested a 2% (95% confidence interval: 0.7%, 3.5%) higher birthweight for every 2-fold higher folate intake, and a Cochrane review suggested a 135 g (95% confidence interval: 47.85 g, 223.68 g) increase in birthweight with folic acid supplement use. However, the observational association between maternal folate and B12 levels and offspring birthweight could be confounded by other maternal characteristics, such as high body mass index (BMI) and gestational diabetes.<SEP>To ensure pregnant women have adequate levels of folate during their pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects, folic acid supplements are recommended to all women planning pregnancy and during the antenatal period. In addition, many countries fortify certain foods with folic acid. For vitamin B12 recommendations vary, with most high-income countries not recommending supplements unless there is clear deficiency. Folate and B12, along with vitamin B6 and B2, are coenzymes or integral components of coenzymes that are involved in one-carbon metabolism, also known as the folate metabolism pathway. One-carbon metabolism is essential for DNA synthesis and DNA methylation, which is particularly important during pregnancy because of the cell division and differentiation occurring in utero. The interplay between folate and B12 is important, both because a folate deficiency can be induced by a B12 deficiency and because high folate levels can mask a B12 deficiency. The interrelationship between these two vitamins is best explained by the methyl trap hypothesis. This hypothesis states that a vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to lowered levels of methionine synthetase, which results in a functional folate deficiency by trapping an increased proportion of folate as the 5-methyl derivative. Low folate and B12 levels may be caused by low dietary intake, lack of intrinsic factor needed to absorb vitamin B12, poor absorption of ingested folate/B12 or an alteration of folate metabolism due to genetic defects or drug interactions.<SEP>Conclusions regarding causality cannot easily be drawn from observational multivariable regression association studies. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to provide information on causality in observational studies. Offspring birthweight is thought to be influenced by offspring genetics, maternal genetics operating on the intrauterine environment, and environmental factors. MR investigating the effect of maternal environmental exposures on offspring birthweight is therefore more complicated, because we have both maternal and offspring genetics (which are correlated, r ≈ 0.5) influencing the outcome of interest. A recently described statistical method, based on structural equation modelling, can be used to estimate the independent effect of maternal genotypes on offspring outcomes by conditioning on offspring genotype. These maternal-specific genetic effects can then be used in a two-sample MR framework to estimate the causal effect of maternal environmental exposures, such as B12 or folate levels, on offspring birthweight. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between serum levels of maternal B12 or folate and offspring birthweight.","Methods<SEP>Publicly available summary results statistics (effect estimates and their standard errors for each SNP’s effect on birthweight, folate levels and B12 levels) were used for the main Mendelian randomization analysis and therefore no additional ethics approval was required. Ethical approval for the Exeter Family of Childhood Health was given by the North and East Devon (UK) Local Research Ethics Committee (approval number 1104), and informed consent was obtained from the parents of the newborns. 23andMe data (used in the maternal gestational age analysis) were collected in compliance with all applicable laws, from human subjects under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol in accordance with US federal guidelines for ‘Protection of Human Subjects’, and the 23andMe activities described herein fall within the scope of the approved protocol. Only aggregate, anonymized data were provided from 23andMe for analysis in this study.<SEP>Exposure measurements<SEP>We extracted summary results data on 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were robustly associated with serum B12 levels and four SNPs that were robustly associated with folate levels, in the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of these phenotypes to date (N = 45 576 individuals of Danish and Icelandic ancestry; Supplementary Table S1, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). The FUT6 variant, rs7788053, was identified in the GWAS as associated with B12 levels but was not included in our analysis, as it is monoallelic in the CEU (Utah Residents from North and West Europe) [https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/] population. The SNP was not available in the GWAS of birthweight and therefore was left out of the analysis.<SEP>We obtained summary results data from the two Danish cohorts in the GWAS (N = 8424) for the 10 SNPs associated with B12 levels and four SNPs associated with folate levels. Due to the interplay between folate and B12 levels, we used these data to investigate the causal effect of B12 levels on folate levels and of folate levels on B12 levels.<SEP>Outcome measurements<SEP>We obtained summary results statistics from the latest GWAS of birthweight published by the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) consortium, which included full-term births (defined as 37 or more weeks of gestation where gestational age was available, or a birthweight of 2.5–4.5 kg for UK Biobank). The GWAS of birthweight included 297 356 individuals reporting their own birthweight and 210 248 women reporting their offspring's birthweight. Due to the correlation between maternal and fetal genotypes, and the influence of both genotypes on offspring birthweight, the authors used a structural equation model to estimate the independent maternal and fetal genetic effects on birthweight (this model is similar to a conditional linear model, accounting for both maternal and fetal genotypes). We extracted publicly available summary results data for the maternal- and fetal-specific effects on birthweight, generated using the structural equation models as described by Warrington and colleagues, published online by the EGG consortium [https://egg-consortium.org/birth-weight-2019.html] (Supplementary Table S2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). The MMACHC SNP, rs12272669, which is associated with B12 levels, was not available in the GWAS summary results statistics for birthweight, so we extracted an SNP in high linkage disequilibrium (LD), rs11234541 (R2 = 0.942, D’ = 1) [https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/].<SEP>In the folate GWAS, the MTHFR SNP, rs17421511, was identified to be associated with folate in an analysis that conditioned on another MTHFR SNP, rs1801133. Therefore, we performed an approximate conditional and joint (COJO) analysis in genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) using European ancestry meta-analysis summary statistics for the maternal- and fetal-specific effects on birthweight, conditioning on rs1801133. The reference panel for determining LD was made up of 47 674 unrelated UK Biobank participants defined by the UK Biobank as having British ancestry. Unrelated individuals with British ancestry were identified on the basis of identity by descent (IBD) sharing of <0.1, and from there a random sample of individuals with identity by state (IBS) <0.025 were selected as the reference panel. We extracted the maternal- and fetal-specific effect estimates for rs17421511 from the COJO analysis (Supplementary Table S2).<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>To assess instrument strength for the standard inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR analysis, we calculated the approximate F statistics for each of the folate and B12 SNPs that will be used in our two-sample MR study [i.e. F ≈ (β/SE)2] (Supplementary Table S1). In the case of MR Egger regression analysis, the F statistics from the individual markers are not a sufficient indicator of instrument strength. Rather, Bowden and colleagues show that an  statistic can be used to quantify instrument strength in MR Egger analyses. The authors show that a high value of  (i.e. close to one) suggests that the instrument effect sizes are estimated well and that measurement error/weak instrument bias is unlikely to affect the results of standard MR Egger analyses. On the other hand, if  is less than 0.9, inference from MR Egger should be interpreted with caution and some alternative sensitivity analyses should be considered. As such, we calculated  values for our SNPs to assess the instrument strength in the MR Egger analysis.<SEP>We performed two-sample, IVW MR analysis to estimate the causal effect of maternal B12 or folate levels on offspring birthweight. We performed a secondary analysis investigating the causal relationship between an individual’s own B12 or folate levels and their own birthweight, using the results of the fetal-specific genetic effects on birthweight. Analyses were performed with the TwoSampleMR package [https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR] in R version 3.5.2 [https://cran.r-project.org/]. We performed a test of heterogeneity of causal effect estimates across each of the SNPs using Cochran’s Q. If heterogeneity was detected, leave-one-out IVW analysis was performed to assess the effect of the individual SNPs on the overall causal estimate. We tested for directional pleiotropy using the MR Egger intercept. Additionally, we conducted sensitivity analysis to adjust for any directional pleiotropy, using MR Egger regression, weighted median, simple and weighted mode estimation. We acknowledge that these sensitivity analyses perform well with large numbers of SNPs and may not perform well in our analyses for effects of folate where we only have four SNPs; however, we include the results of the MR Egger for completeness. As the weighted and simple mode estimator select the group of SNPs that produce the most common causal effect on the outcome, we chose not to perform these analysis for folate where only four SNPs were available.<SEP>Further sensitivity analyses were conducted for the B12 analysis excluding the FUT2 variant, rs602662. The FUT2 protein, which is expressed in the small intestine, is a part of the protein glycosylation pathway and is involved in the absorption and modification of several nutrients. Therefore it may reflect nutritional status, which in turn could affect a multitude of lifestyle-associated traits and diseases. In a previous MR study investigating the causal relationship between B12 and BMI, the causal relationship identified between low B12 levels and higher BMI attenuated to the null when the variant in the FUT2 gene was excluded from the analysis. We therefore performed the MR analyses both with and without the FUT2 variant, to assess the effect of this potentially pleiotropic variant on the causal estimate, as has been done in previous papers.<SEP>Three of the variants associated with folate levels were located within the MTHFR gene. We looked up the LD between the variants (Supplementary Table S3, available as Supplementary data at IJE online) and conducted a leave-one-out MR analysis as a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of the individual SNPs.<SEP>Finally, we performed IVW MR analysis and sensitivity analyses to adjust for directional pleiotropy, to assess the causal effect of B12 levels on folate and of folate levels on B12. If evidence for a casual effect is identified, we planed to use two-step MR to investigate whether there was evidence that one maternal exposure mediates the relationship between the other and offspring birthweight.<SEP>Follow-up analysis of gestational duration<SEP>Gestational duration is a major determinant of birthweight. Since gestational duration was unavailable for >85% of individuals in the GWAS of birthweight, it is possible that a causal relationship between maternal B12 or folate and birthweight could be driven by a relationship with gestational duration. Therefore, we performed a two-sample IVW MR analysis to estimate the causal effect of maternal B12 and folate levels on gestational duration. We obtained summary results data from the latest maternal GWAS study of gestational duration of 43 568 women of European ancestry from 23andMe, presented in Zhang et al. For the fetal GWAS of gestational duration, we obtained summary results data from the latest EGG Consortium study of 84 689 individuals. For the B12 analysis, the MMACHC SNP rs12272669 was not available in the maternal or fetal gestational duration GWAS (and no SNPs in high LD (R2 >0.8) were available), leaving a total of nine SNPs for analysis. The effect allele frequencies were not available in the publicly available summary results data from the fetal GWAS of gestational duration, so we removed the MMAA SNP, rs2270665, from the B12 analysis as it is a palindromic SNP and we could not confirm that the direction of effect was the same as in the B12 summary statistics. We conducted sensitivity analysis using MR Egger regression, weighted median, simple and weighted mode estimation to adjust for any potentially pleiotropic SNPs. Similar to the birthweight analysis, we caution the interpretation of the folate sensitivity analyses, due to the small number of SNPs available.<SEP>Checking SNP associations with B12 and folate levels in pregnant women from the Exeter Family Study of Childhood Health study<SEP>We performed an association analysis of the SNPs associated with B12/folate and the serum level of the two vitamins, measured at 28 weeks of gestation in a total of 871 pregnant women from the Exeter Family Study of Childhood Health (EFSOCH). Genome-wide genotyping and imputation in this study have been described previously. The outcome variables were inverse-normal transformed before analysis, and the linear regression analysis was adjusted for maternal age and five ancestry principal components. The rs12272669 variant in the MMACHC gene was not available, so rs11234541 in high LD (r2 = 0.9421 in CEU) was used as a proxy. This SNP had low imputation quality in the EFSOCH study (INFO = 0.68), and the results should be interpreted with care.<SEP>Informed consent<SEP>Only publicly available summary results data were used in the birthweight MR analyses. Participants in EFSOCH gave informed consent, and ethical approval was obtained from local review committee. 23andMe data (used in the maternal gestational age analysis) were collected in compliance with all applicable laws, from human subjects under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol in accordance with US federal guidelines for ‘Protection of Human Subjects’, and the 23andMe activities described herein fall within the scope of the approved protocol. Only aggregate, anonymized data were provided from 23andMe for analysis in this study.","Results<SEP>The 10 variants included in the MR analysis of maternal serum B12 levels explained 5.24% of the variance in serum B12 concentrations in the original GWAS (3.82% without the FUT2 variant, rs602662). The four variants included in the MR analysis of maternal folate levels explained 1.3% of the total variation in serum folate concentration in the original GWAS. F statistics for individual SNPs ranged from 35 to 623 for B12 and from 48 to 203 for folate levels. The magnitude of the SNP effects on serum B12 and folate concentrations measured in pregnant women from the EFSOCH study were consistent with those from the original GWAS (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online), apart from the MMACHC variant, rs12272669, which appeared to have little effect in pregnant women at 28 weeks of gestation (heterogeneity P = 0.0002). However, we used a proxy for this variant in the EFSOCH study, rs11234541, which was in high LD with rs12272669 but had low imputation quality.<SEP>The causal effect estimates of maternal and fetal B12 and folate levels on birthweight from the IVW analysis and sensitivity analyses are shown in Table 1. We found no evidence for a causal effect of maternal B12 levels on offspring birthweight [0.009 SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher B12 (SEIVW = 0.012), PIVW = 0.469; Figure 1], or of fetal B12 levels on their own birthweight [−0.012 SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher B12 (SEIVW = 0.017), PIVW = 0.478; Supplementary Figure S3, available as Supplementary data at IJE online]. The effect estimates were similar when excluding the FUT2 variant, rs602662 (Supplementary Table S4, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).<SEP>We found evidence of a positive causal effect of maternal folate levels on offspring birthweight [0.146 SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher folate (SEIVW = 0.041), PIVW = 4x10-4; Figure 2]. Furthermore, we identified a negative effect of fetal folate levels on their own birthweight, although the effect size was nearly a third of the maternal folate causal effect estimate [−0.051 SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher folate (SEIVW = 0.025), PIVW = 0.037; Supplementary Figure S4].<SEP>There was evidence of heterogeneity in the causal effect estimates of fetal B12 levels on their own birthweight across the individual SNPs (Q = 27.790, P = 0.001), but no strong evidence of heterogeneity in the causal effect estimates of maternal B12 levels on offspring birthweight (Q = 12.486, P = 0.162). To investigate the heterogeneity further, we performed leave-one-out analysis of fetal B12 levels on their own birthweight (Supplementary Table S5, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). As indicated by the heterogeneity test, there was some variability in the causal estimates, particularly when leaving the MMACHC SNP, rs12272669, or the FUT2 SNP, rs602662, out of the analysis. Even though there are no known pleiotropic pathways for the MMACHC gene, we a priori expected the FUT2 gene to have pleiotropic effects. The causal effect estimates of maternal folate levels on offspring birthweight across the individual SNPs also showed some heterogeneity (Q = 6.904, P = 0.075), but no evidence for the fetal folate levels (Q = 0.018, P = 0.999). To investigate the potential influence of the SNPs in LD in the MTHFR gene and potential heterogeneity identified for the maternal folate levels, we performed a leave-one-out analysis on both maternal and fetal folate levels on birthweight (Supplementary Table S6, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). When the MTHFR SNP rs1801133 was excluded from the analysis, the causal effect was attenuated for the effect of maternal folate levels (0.099, SE = 0.051, P = 0.051), but stayed the same and for fetal folate levels (−0.051, SE = 0.034, P = 0.132).<SEP>There was no evidence of directional pleiotropy from the MR Egger regression analysis for either B12 or folate levels on birthweight (Egger intercept for maternal B12 levels = 0.003, P = 0.500; Egger intercept for fetal B12 levels = −0.002, P = 0.662; Egger intercept for maternal folate levels = −0.028, P = 0.187; Egger intercept for fetal folate levels = 0.000, P = 0.988), although again highlighting that the MR Egger result from the folate analysis would be unreliable due to the small number of SNPs. This is further supported by the low I2GX of 0.83 for the folate analysis, which is below the suggested cut-off of 0.9, suggesting that the MR Egger results could be influenced by measurement error or weak instrument bias. Bowden's I2GX was 0.98 for B12, suggesting little influence in the MR Egger analyses from measurement error or weak instrument bias.<SEP>We were unable to detect evidence for a causal effect of B12 levels on folate levels in the two Danish cohorts (Supplementary Table S7, available as Supplementary data at IJE online), indicating that maternal folate levels are unlikely to mediate a relationship between maternal B12 levels and offspring birthweight. In the IVW analysis, we detected a small causal effect of folate levels on B12 levels in the two Danish cohorts (0.155 SD change in B12 per 1 SD higher folate (SEIVW = 0.077), PIVW = 0.043; Supplementary Table S8, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). However, given there is no evidence of a causal effect of maternal B12 levels on offspring birthweight, it is unlikely that B12 levels mediate the relationship between maternal folate levels and offspring birthweight.<SEP>Last, we did not find any evidence of a causal effect of maternal or fetal B12 or folate levels on gestational duration (Table 2). There was no evidence of directional pleiotropy from the MR Egger regression analysis or of heterogeneity between the causal estimates at each SNP (Maternal: Directional Pleiotropy: PB12 = 0.28, PFolate = 0.87; Heterogeneity: PB12 = 0.08, PFolate = 0.63; Fetal: Directional pleiotropy: PB12 = 0.59, PFolate = 0.38; Heterogeneity: PB12 = 0.12, PFolate = 0.21).","Discussion<SEP>We did not find any evidence for a causal effect of maternal B12 levels on offspring birthweight [0.009 (−0.015, 0.033) SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher B12, corresponding to a 4 g increase (−7 g, 16 g) in birthweight per 1 SD higher B12], nor was there evidence that fetal B12 levels influenced their own birthweight. The results were consistent across the different sensitivity methods applied, including the analyses with or without the FUT2 variant. In contrast, we found evidence of a positive causal effect of maternal folate levels on offspring birthweight [0.146 (0.065, 0.227) SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher folate, which corresponds to an increase in birthweight of 71 g (31 g, 110 g) per 1 SD higher folate]. Although we could not detect any evidence for directional pleiotropy or heterogeneity in these analyses, we have limited capacity to test this due to having only four SNPs associated with folate. We also found some evidence of an inverse effect of fetal folate levels on their own birthweight [−0.051 (−0.100, −0.003) SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher folate, corresponding to a 25 g [−48 g, −1 g] decrease in birthweight per 1 SD higher folate).<SEP>Previous multivariable regression association studies investigating the relationship between maternal B12 levels and offspring birthweight have been inconsistent. Nevertheless, these studies are all relatively small (samples sizes from 51 to 5577 in the meta-analysis presented by Rogne and colleagues) and therefore the effect size estimates from the multivariable regression analyses between maternal B12 levels and offspring birthweight had large confidence intervals. In addition, the meta-analysis combining the results from 12 studies found no evidence of an association between maternal B12 levels and offspring birthweight (N = 9406), with an estimate similar to the results of our MR analysis [5.1 g (−10.9 g, 21.0 g) change in birthweight per 1 SD increase in maternal B12 levels]. Multivariable regression association studies and MR have different assumptions and sources of bias; however, with regards to maternal B12 levels on offspring birthweight, the effect estimates in the meta-analysis of multivariable regression analyses and our MR are similar, providing additional confidence in our result. In the meta-analysis, Rogne and colleagues observed some heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 30%), which was driven by an association between B12 deficiency and birthweight in low- and middle-income countries. They suggested that this association could be explained by preterm birth rather than reduced fetal growth; however, we did not see any evidence for this in our MR analysis with gestational duration. Notably, one of the 10 SNPs from the birthweight analysis was not available for the MR analysis estimating the causal effect of maternal B12 levels on gestational duration. There could be several reasons why we were unable to find any evidence of an effect of B12 levels on offspring birthweight within the normal range. First, there could be a weak effect that we were unable to detect with the current statistical power of our study. Second, folate deficiency can be induced by a B12 deficiency, so there may be a stronger effect of maternal B12 deficiency on offspring birthweight than maternal B12 levels within the normal range. As such, monitoring both B12 and folate levels during pregnancy might be important.<SEP>Consistent with previous multivariable regression association studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), our MR study suggests a causal effect of higher maternal folate levels on increased offspring birthweight. Our MR analysis goes one step further than the multivariable regression studies and RCTs, as we have used serum levels of folate, whereas the previous studies were based on the use of folic acid supplements in pregnancy without quantifying the downstream effect that those supplements have on serum levels. We found a potential negative causal effect of fetal folate levels, as proxied by the fetal genotype, on their own birthweight, although the effect size was only about a third of the positive effect of maternal folate levels on offspring birthweight. The mechanism underlying this effect is unclear, as folate is actively transported across the placenta by folate transporters, and not produced by the fetus. However, folate is metabolized into the active forms both in the mother and in the fetus, so this negative causal effect might indicate that fetal folate metabolism is important. There were only four SNPs included in the folate analysis, three of which are located in the same gene, which was not enough to obtain reliable sensitivity analyses, as partly indicated by the I2GX of 0.83 for the MR Egger regression. Furthermore, the variant rs1801133 in the MTHFR gene has been associated with diastolic blood pressure, which is also known to causally influence birthweight and could therefore indicate potentially pleiotropic pathways [Causal effect estimate from the leave-one-out analysis removing rs1801133: 48 g (0 g, 96 g) increase in birthweight per 1 SD higher folate].<SEP>We did not find any evidence of a causal effect of maternal or fetal folate levels on gestational duration, suggesting that our finding of a causal effect of maternal folate levels on offspring birthweight cannot be attributed to gestational duration. However, the sample size in the gestational duration GWAS (Maternal: N = 43 568; Fetal: N = 84 689) was smaller than the GWAS of birthweight (N = 297 356 individuals reporting their own birthweight and 210 248 women reporting their offspring's birthweight) and the maternal SNP effect estimates on gestational duration were not conditioned on fetal genotype.<SEP>It is important to examine the findings of a causal relationship between folate and birthweight within the bigger picture. Given that low maternal folate levels during pregnancy are known to cause neural tube defects, we would obviously not argue for stopping the widespread recommendation and use of folic acid supplements during pregnancy and the fortification of foods. Indeed, based on our results, folic acid supplementation and fortification of foods may have contributed to the observed increase in birthweight and reduction of babies born small for gestational age seen over the past few decades (23 g to 46 g, in a 9–18-year time span).<SEP>Strengths and limitations<SEP>One of the strengths of our study was the ability to use the partitioned maternal and fetal genetic effects from the largest GWAS of birthweight (N = 297 356 individuals reporting their own birthweight and 210 248 women reporting their offspring's birthweight) in a two-sample MR approach to estimate the effect of maternal B12 and folate levels on offspring birthweight, independent of any direct fetal effect. We performed a series of sensitivity analyses to explore potential bias due to horizontal pleiotropy, including comparing findings for B12 levels with and without the FUT2 genetic instrument which has been shown to have pleiotropic effects. However, we acknowledge that the methods used for the sensitivity analyses work best with more SNPs than we had available in our analyses. For folate, the I2GX of 0.83, below the suggested cut-off of 0.9, indicates that the MR Egger results could be influenced by measurement error or weak instrument bias.<SEP>An important limitation with this study is that the folate and vitamin B12 levels measured and used in the exposure GWAS were from non-pregnant women, as well as men. However, we were able to check that the instruments were valid in a pregnant population by performing an association analysis in the EFSOCH study. We found no evidence of different effect sizes in pregnant women compared with the exposure GWAS used in these analyses, except for in the rs12272669 variant in the MMACHC gene. The proxy SNP we used in the EFSOCH study, rs11234541, had low imputation quality, and as such the results should be interpreted with care.<SEP>Last, it is important to note that even though we did not find any effect of maternal B12 levels on offspring birthweight, that does not mean that B12 levels do not have an effect on the development of the fetus. B12 levels could influence growth in a particular period of the pregnancy, affect a particular organ or growth of fat, lean or skeletal tissue in different directions, which may not be reflected in an outcome such as birthweight.",31113,['VITMIN']
33686673,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Livedoid vasculopathy (LV) was first described by Milian in 1929 and was also named atrophie blanche, segmental hyalinising vasculitis, and livedo reticularis with summer ulcerations. LV mainly affects young and middle‐aged women with an incidence of 1:100000 and presents with erythema, macules, painful ulcers, white satellite scars on both lower extremities. Hypercoagulability and thromboembolism in dermal vessels are the major causes of its pathogenesis. Therefore, the term LV is now frequently used to distinguish thrombo‐occlusive vasculopathy from traditional cutaneous small vessel vasculitis.<SEP>A variety of hereditary and acquired coagulation abnormalities have been detected in LV patients, including polymorphisms in Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), Plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 (PAI‐1), Prothrombin, and Factor V. The variants, including single‐nucleotide polymorphisms, in the coagulation‐related genes mentioned earlier change or influence their expression and increase the risk of thrombosis, which contributes to the onset of LV. Furthermore, several case reports, case series, and other studies indicate the relationship between LV and certain genetic variants. However, no large‐scale analyses have been conducted concerning genetic variants in LV. Here, we carried out a systematic review of the published literature, focusing on the polymorphisms C677T and A1298C in MTHFR, ‐675 4G/5G and A844G in PAI‐1, G20210A in Prothrombin and G1691A in Factor V (the Leiden mutation), which have been reported in LV patients.","METHODS<SEP>Literature search<SEP>We screened PubMed and Embase databases on 14 September 2020 for articles concerning LV patients and genetic mutations (Figure 1). LV has a diversity of historic names and associated genes; therefore, the following broad search terms were applied: “livedoid vasculopathy”, “livedoid vasculitis”, “livedo vasculitis”, “atrophie blanche”, “white atrophy”, “segmental hyalinizing vasculitis”, “mutation”, “polymorphism”, “genotype”, “methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase”, “MTHFR”, “Plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1”, “PAI‐1”, “Prothrombin”, “Factor V”, and “Leiden”. Only studies, case series, and case reports published in English from inception of the databases to September 2020 were included. No other filters or restrictions were applied to the search.<SEP>Eligibility criteria<SEP>Inclusion criteria are as follows: (a) clinically and histologically confirmed LV diagnosis. Patients clinically presented as recurrent livedo reticularis, erythema, macules, painful ulcers, and white satellite scars on both lower extremities with intraluminal thrombosis, endothelial proliferation, and segmental hyalinisation in dermal vessels on histology. (b) At least one of the following variants were tested: MTHFR C677T and A1298C, PAI‐1‐675 4G/5G and A844G, Prothrombin G20210A and Factor V G1691A (the Leiden mutation). If patients were tested for several variants in an article, and heterozygosity or homozygosity were not clearly presented, then only the clearly recorded genotypes were enrolled. (c) Articles published in the English language. (d) Article types including case‐control studies, case series, and case reports were enrolled.<SEP>Exclusion criteria are as follows: (a) the diagnosis of LV was uncertain; (b) heterozygosity or homozygosity of variants tested were not clearly recorded; (c) articles written in languages other than English; (d) review articles or editorial articles.","RESULTS<SEP>After the extensive literature search, 53 articles were found in PubMed and Embase databases that concern genetic variants in LV patients. By carefully reviewing the full texts of these 53 articles, 30 were enrolled that complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1). A total of 265 patients, of whom 78 were male (29.43%) and 187 were female (70.57%) giving a female to male ratio of 2.4:1, were tested for at least one out of the following six genetic variants, MTHFR C677T and A1298C, PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G and A844G, and Prothrombin G20210A and Factor V G1691A. The mean patient age was 35.74 years (range: 12–87 years). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Hind III restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), or sequencing. The ref SNP ID, location, and affected function are summarised in Table 2.<SEP> SNPs <SEP>MTHFR C677T<SEP>Thirteen articles presented LV patients that were examined for MTHFR C677T, although one article referred vaguely to its heterozygosity or homozygosity. A total of 129 patients were tested for MTHFR C677T, of which 46 had the heterozygous CT genotype (35.66%) and 25 had the homozygous TT genotype (19.38%). Thus, the total carrier rate of MTHFR C677T was 55.04% (71/129).<SEP>MTHFR A1298C<SEP>There were only two studies and one case report concerning MTHFR A1298C in LV patients. In all, 82 LV patients were tested for MTHFR A1298C. Twenty‐nine patients had the AC genotype (a heterozygous carrier rate of 35.67%) and seven had the CC genotype (a homozygous carrier rate of 8.54%). The carrier rate of MTHFR A1298C was 43.90% (36/82).<SEP>PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G<SEP>Three studies and two case reports presented assessment of PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G in a total of 95 LV patients. Twenty‐eight of 95 LV patients (29.47%) displayed the homozygous 4G/4G genotype, whereas 53 of 95 LV patients (55.79%) showed the heterozygous 4G/5G genotype. The total carrier rate of PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G was 85.26% (81/95), which was the highest carrier rate among the assessed SNPs.<SEP>PAI‐1 A844G<SEP>Compared to PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G, the variant PAI‐1 A844G has been rarely assessed in LV patients. Only two articles, including one study and one case report, have reported a total of 18 LV patients tested for PAI‐1 A844G. Fifty percent of tested LV patients (9/18) had the heterozygous AG genotype, while only one tested LV patient (5.56%) was homozygous for the GG genotype. The carrier rate of PAI‐1 A844G was 55.56% (10/18).<SEP>Prothrombin G20210A<SEP>Eighty‐five LV patients from 15 studies or case reports were evaluated for Prothrombin G20210A, while patients from another three studies were excluded because of vague descriptions of heterozygosity or homozygosity. The total carrier rate of Prothrombin G20210A was 10.59% (9/85), which was the lowest carrier rate of the six SNPs assessed. All the LV patients with Prothrombin G20210A displayed a heterozygous GA genotype (9/85); no homozygous AA carrier was identified (0/85).<SEP>Factor V G1691A<SEP>The total carrier rate of Factor V G1691A (14.07%) in LV patients was the second lowest among the tested SNPs. From 23 articles, 135 LV patients were tested. In one study heterozygosity or homozygosity was not clearly stated; however, the remaining studies showed 19 patients to have the heterozygous GA genotype and no patients to have the homozygous AA genotype (0/135).<SEP>Regional distribution<SEP>Most articles did not refer in detail to the ethnicity or race of patients; therefore, we tried to determine the association between regions and genotypes in LV patients, which may provide clues for relationships between ethnicity and genotypes in LV. Patients were identified from 17 countries and 5 continents involving Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania (Table 3). The heterozygous, homozygous, and total carrier rates of each SNP are summarised in Table 4.<SEP>Asia<SEP>In Asia, there were 11 studies or case reports from eight countries including China, Japan, Singapore, Lebanon, Turkey, India, South Korea, and Afghanistan. A total of 115 LV patients, of whom 36 were male (31.30%) and 79 were female (68.70%), with a mean age of 27.26 years were evaluated. The variant carriers were for 51.15% for MTHFR C677T, 43.86% for MTHFR A1298C, 82.9% for PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G, 1.67% for Prothrombin G20210A, and 6.45% in Factor V G1691A. The PAI‐1 A844G polymorphism has not yet been tested in Asian populations.<SEP>Europe<SEP>In Europe, there were eight articles involving 49 LV patients from five countries, including Portugal, Spain, Britain, Germany, and France. The female to male ratio was 1.88:1, and the mean age of these LV patients was 40.43 years. The variant carrier rates were 64.28% for MTHFR C677T, 44% for MTHFR A1298C, 94.45% for PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G, 55.56% for PAI‐1 A844G, 15.79% for Prothrombin G20210A, and 21.74% for Factor V G1691A.<SEP>North America<SEP>In North America, seven studies or case reports were enrolled; one article was partially excluded because of a lack of description of heterozygosity or homozygosity. Six out of the seven articles were conducted in America, the other was from Mexico. A total of 51 LV patients from North America, 13 males and 38 females with a mean age of 43 years, were tested for genetic variation. The total mutation carrier rates were 75% for Prothrombin G20210A and 28.57% for Factor V G1691A. There were only case reports for carriers of wild‐type MTHFR C677T and PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G. MTHFR A1298C and PAI‐1 A844G have not yet been tested in North America.<SEP>South America<SEP>There were three studies conducted in South America, all in Brazil, and two of them only vaguely described mutations in MTHFR, Prothrombin G20210A, and Factor V G1691A, was and so were partially ignored. There were a total of 49 LV patients consisting of 12 males and 37 females, with a mean age of 33.17 years. The carrier rate of MTHFR C677T and Factor V G1691A was 64.29% and 17.14%, respectively.<SEP>Oceania<SEP>In Oceania, only one case report from Australia was identified. A 53‐year‐old female LV patient was tested for Prothrombin G20210A and Factor V G1691A and showed a heterozygous GA genotype for Prothrombin G20210A. ","DISCUSSION<SEP>LV mainly affects female patients with a female to male ratio of 2.4:1. The mean age ranges from 27.26 to 53 years in the five continents, with an earlier disease onset in Asian populations compared to LV patients in Europe, South America, and North America. Feng et al emphasised that the peak age at disease onset was much younger in Chinese LV patients than that in the published literature. Our review findings of the demographic data are consistent with the results of Feng et al and also provide the clinical characteristics of early onset in Asian LV patients.<SEP>Currently, hypercoagulability and abnormalities in coagulation function are considered the main mechanisms of pathogenesis in LV. Platelets, coagulation and anticoagulation system, and fibrinolysis system maintain dynamic balance and participate in physiological haemostasis and removal of abnormal blood clots. The six variants examined in this review are known to participate in the development of hypercoagulability and thrombophilia by acting on different pathways. MTHFR C677T and A1298C promote the prethrombotic state by affecting homocysteine levels through folate metabolism, the metabolites of which cause damage to vascular endothelial cells, whereas PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G and A844G, Prothrombin G20210A and Factor V G1691A influence the endogenous fibrinolytic system and coagulation function, increasing the risk of hypercoagulability. In this review, we found that PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G was the most common variant in LV patients, accounting for 85.26%. PAI‐1 A844G, MTHFR C677T, and MTHFR A1298C were the second, third, and fourth most commonly existing variants in LV patients. The carrier rates of Prothrombin G20210A and Factor V G1691A were at relatively lower percentages.<SEP>The epidemiology of theses variants may vary depending on geography and ethnicity. Grouped by continents, LV patients from Asia and Europe demonstrated higher rates of PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G, with heterozygous 4G/5G being the major genotype that accounted for over 50% of variants. Although the total carrier rate of PAI‐1 A844G was more than 50% in European LV patients, up to now PAI‐1 A844G has only been detected in LV patients from Europe. PAI‐1 A844G has not been detected in LV patients from continents other than Europe. The carrier rate of MTHFR C677T was slightly higher in LV patients from Europe and South America. However, there was no significant difference in the MTHFR A1298C rate between LV patients in Asia and Europe. Prothrombin G20210A and Factor V G1691A showed relatively lower carrier rates; however, compared with LV patients from Asia, rates in LV patients from Europe, North America and South America were higher.<SEP>In this review, PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G was the most frequently detected variant and by influencing the expression of PAI‐1 it is involved in the pathogenesis of LV. The 4G allele results in a higher PAI‐1 expression level. Even though overexpression and enhanced activity of PAI‐1 have been detected in LV patients, its role in pathogenesis remains unclear. PAI‐1 is probably involved in far more processes than just thrombosis; it may play roles in other pathophysiological processes and activities, such as cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment targeting PAI‐1 is regarded as a promising therapy for LV. The tPA therapy was reported to be effective in LV patients with PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/4G homozygous genotype. Therefore, PAI‐1 in LV pathogenesis warrants further study.<SEP>This review has explored the association between LV and genetic variation. However, few case control studies were enrolled, with case series and case reports being the main resource. Ideally, a large scale case‐control study of genetic variation in LV patients should be performed. And the multilocus effects by multifactor dimensionality reduction indicating gene‐gene interaction and gene‐environmental interactions may probably provide new insight into LV in further case‐control study.",13766,['VITMIN']
21857689,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Idiopathic male infertility is an important contributor to infertility overall. Abnormal folate metabolism has been proposed as a factor in male infertility. This is biologically plausible because folate-derived one-carbon units are critical in DNA synthesis and the regulation of DNA transcription via methylation, two key processes in spermatogenesis.<SEP>The 677C>T variant in the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), an essential enzyme for providing methyl groups for the regulation of DNA transcription, has been studied extensively as a risk factor with mixed results. A recent meta-analysis concluded that MTHFR 677C>T was a risk factor for idiopathic male infertility. However, only one investigation by Lee et al. presented actual serum folate concentrations for study subjects, an important factor in determining what the physiological effect of the MTHFR variant would be. Almost no studies have examined blood vitamin B12 (B12) concentrations, although B12 is an essential component of one-carbon metabolism, being a cofactor in the folate-dependent conversion of homocysteine to methionine; and few have examined plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations despite the fact that elevated tHcy is a marker for poor folate and B12 function.<SEP>We investigated the association between folate/B12 metabolism and idiopathic male infertility by measuring circulating concentrations of serum folate, red cell folate (RCF), B12 and plasma tHcy, and by genotyping variants of 12 folate/B12/homocysteine metabolism-related genes in infertile and fertile men.","MATERIALS AND METHODS<SEP>Study population<SEP>Between March 2003 and August 2008, 200 infertile men were recruited from the Reproductive Medicine Center at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö. The men had to be between 20 and 45 years of age with partners less than 40 years of age. They were required to have had regular sexual intercourse without contraception for ≥1 year without achieving a pregnancy, to answer questions about their medical and behavioral history, and to provide blood and semen samples. They were examined for other possible causes of infertility by a research nurse and were surveyed about their partner’s reproductive health history to rule out female infertility. The work-up of the female partner followed standard clinical criteria. In all women, gynecological history, hormonal evaluation and ovarian ultrasound were performed. The fallopian tubes were assessed by X-ray or ultrasound in cases where damage to the fallopian tubes was suspected (previous pregnancy, abdominal/genital surgery or infection/inflammation).<SEP>Excluded from the analysis were men not having regular, unprotected intercourse (n = 5), who withdrew consent (n = 3), who did not provide adequate screening information or biological specimens (n = 22), who had partners with disturbances in ovulation (n = 3), and who had histories of cancer (n = 1), cryptorchidism (n = 4), Klinefelter’s syndrome (n = 2) or microdeletions (n = 6). One man was dropped when he impregnated his partner. Other exclusion criteria were a history of vasectomy, obstructive azoospermia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or mumps orchitis, but we did not observe any men with these conditions. After exclusions 153 infertile men remained.<SEP>We recruited 200 fertile men from among couples attending prenatal care clinics in Lund and Malmö. Fertile study participants were required to have achieved at least one pregnancy with a female partner, stopped practicing birth control to achieve the present pregnancy, to be within the same age ranges as infertile couples and to have achieved the present pregnancy in <12 months of unprotected intercourse. Fertile men were excluded because they did not fulfill the age criteria (n = 1), had partners who did not fulfill the age criteria (n = 2), did not discontinue contraception to achieve their current pregnancy (n = 3), did not provide adequate screening information or biological specimens (n = 4), had histories of cryptorchidism (n = 5) or were part of a couple that had prior infertility treatment (n = 1). Other exclusion criteria were a history of cancer and treatment of mumps orchitis, but we did not observe any men with these conditions. After exclusions 184 fertile men remained.<SEP>Study design<SEP>Cases (infertile men) and fertile controls responded to a questionnaire for ascertainment of reproductive, medical and recent dietary history and provided blood and semen for analysis. The time between semen sample collection and blood drawing ranged from 0 to 3 months. Men were asked if they took any vitamins. Those who took any supplements containing folic acid were considered vitamin users for this analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Lund University, Sweden and the National Institutes of Health, the United States. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.<SEP>Semen analysis<SEP>Investigators followed the World Health Organization’s guidelines for collecting and analyzing semen samples. Skåne University Hospital is a reference laboratory for the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and the Nordic Association for Andrology Quality Control Programme. Semen volume, sperm concentration, total number of sperm per ejaculate, and sperm motility and morphology were determined. The strict criteria for morphology were applied. Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated using the sperm chromatin structure assay.<SEP>Blood measurements<SEP>Serum and plasma were stored at −20 °C. Frozen samples were randomized and investigators performing the measurements were blinded to the case–control status of the samples. Microbiological assays were used to measure concentrations of folate and B12 in serum and folate in erythrocytes. Plasma tHcy was measured by automated immunoassay using fluorescent polarization.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>Genomic DNA extracted from blood samples was genotyped for 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 genes related to folate, B12 and homocysteine metabolism using a competitive allele-specific PCR genotyping system (KBiosciences, Herts, UK). SNPs were selected because they were reported to have an effect on folate, B12 or tHcy levels or were identified as important in the medical literature. Quality control procedures included repeat genotyping of all SNPs for 17 subjects and a repeat DNA extraction for 20 subjects. Genotype concordance was 100% for repeat genotyping and 99.8% for genotypes from repeat DNA extractions. The proportion of genotypes that were successfully called was >95.8% for all 20 SNPs. For each SNP, a test of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was performed separately for case and control subjects. Two SNPs were not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium among controls: MTHFR 1298A>C (rs1801131), P = 0.0071; and MTRR S175L (rs1532268), P = 0.0076. There was no deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium among cases.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>The characteristics of cases and controls were compared using unpaired two sample t-tests, Pearson’s chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Linear regression models were used to compare semen quality between users and non-users of vitamins, and mean folate, B12 and tHcy concentrations between cases and controls, while adjusting for covariates. Linear regression was also used to examine associations between semen quality and folate, B12 and tHcy concentrations. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between risk of infertility (case–control status) and metabolite concentrations among non-users of vitamins, and for case–control comparisons of SNP genotype distributions. For SNPs that showed an association with infertility status, linear regression was used to compare semen quality among the genotype groups separately for cases and controls, and after restricting the study sample to non-users of vitamins. Age (continuous), education (elementary, high school, beyond high school), smoking (yes/no), length of abstinence, parents born in Sweden (yes/no) and use of vitamins (use of folic acid containing vitamins, use of other vitamins, no use) were included as covariates in linear and logistic regression models. SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.","RESULTS<SEP>Demographic characteristics of the 184 fertile controls and 153 infertile cases by use of folic acid-containing vitamin status are presented in Table 1. Infertile men and their partners were older and the men had a higher mean body mass index. The fertile controls were significantly more educated. Duration of abstinence before semen sample collection was longer in the infertile group. The proportions that used vitamins containing folic acid and that smoked were similar in the two groups.<SEP>As anticipated, infertile cases had poorer overall semen quality than fertile controls. Infertile subjects had lower mean semen concentration, sperm number, percentage total progressive sperm and percentage normal sperm morphology (all P<0.05). Infertile subjects had higher percentages of non-motile sperm, higher mean semen volume and more incidences of DNA fragmentation than fertile controls (all P<0.05) (data not shown).<SEP>When we compared the infertile subjects who used and did not use folic acid-containing vitamins, there were no significant differences in semen quality after adjustment (Table 2). The linear regression results did not show significant associations between semen parameters and folate, B12 and tHcy concentrations in cases or controls.<SEP>In both the case and control groups, subjects who reported taking vitamin supplements had higher folate and B12 concentrations and lower tHcy concentrations than non-users of supplements. All the differences between users and non-users were statistically significant (P<0.05) (data not shown).<SEP>The following analyses focused on non-users of vitamins on the assumption that, if low folate concentrations were an important factor, the use of vitamins would very likely obscure the effect. Among non-users of vitamins, serum folate and RCF concentrations were significantly lower in the infertile than the fertile group (P = 0.0063 and P = 0.044, respectively) after adjusting for age, smoking and abstinence time (Table 3). When education was added to the regression model, serum folate remained significant (P = 0.022); RCF did not. As expected with lower folate concentrations, the tHcy concentration was higher in infertile than fertile men, although the difference was not statistically significant (Table 3). B12 concentrations were lower in the infertile than the fertile group, but the difference was not statistically significant. In the logistic regression analysis, serum folate was a significant predictor of being a case (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.18–0.90); RCF, B12 and tHcy were not.<SEP>Table 4 lists the 12 genes associated with folate/B12/tHcy metabolism. Male infertility was positively associated with being homozygous for the choline pathway enzyme gene phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) M175V minor V allele (OR: 7.91; 95% CI: 1.60–39.05; P = 0.01) and negatively associated with the B12 transcobalamin receptor gene TCblR (also known as CD320) variant rs173665 in the heterozygous subjects (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.15–0.77; P = 0.009). No cases homozygous for the minor A allele were found. Homozygosity for the MTHFR 1298A>C minor C allele was associated with infertility status; however, this SNP was not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium among controls. No statistically significant genotype results remained after correction for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. There was no association between semen quality measures or folate/B12/tHcy levels and PEMT M175V or TCblR rs173665 genotypes.<SEP>MTHFR 677C>T was not associated with male infertility in our study population. To determine whether this was due to higher folate concentrations in our population compared to previous studies, we repeated the analysis in those whose serum folate concentration was below the study population median (14.70 nmol l−1). The results were unchanged.","DISCUSSION<SEP>Among non-users of vitamins, the infertile men in our study had significantly lower serum folate concentrations than fertile controls. RCF concentrations were not significantly lower in cases after adjusting for education, suggesting that lower socioeconomic status-related dietary factors could explain the difference. Cases and controls did not differ in B12 and tHcy concentrations. No metabolite concentrations were correlated significantly with any semen parameters. Of the folate/B12/homocysteine-related genes that we studied, variants for two: the transcobalamin receptor gene, TCblR, and the choline pathway gene, PEMT, were related to infertility before correction for multiple comparisons.<SEP>Only a few folate-, B12- or homocysteine-related polymorphisms have been investigated as risk factors for idiopathic male infertility. We attempted to confirm many of them. A recent meta-analysis of MTHFR 677C>T reported a significant association. We found no association even when we limited our analysis to subjects with folate concentrations below the median; however, the upper bound of our 95% CI is within the range of the reported effect. A few studies have looked for an association between male infertility and variants in two key enzyme genes involved in methylation and homocysteine metabolism, MTR and MTRR, with mixed results. We did not find SNPs in either MTR or MTRR to be associated with infertility; we also confirmed that RFC1 (also known as SLC19A1) R27H was not associated with infertility.<SEP>The other eight genes we investigated in the areas of folate, B12 and homocysteine metabolism have not, to our knowledge, been investigated previously. Variants in these enzyme genes are potentially important because they affect homocysteine and choline metabolism (BHMT, PEMT), folate transport and action (FOLH1, MTHFD1, SHMT1, PCFT) and B12 uptake (TCblR) and transport (TCN2).<SEP>Of the 20 SNPs that we studied, PEMT M175V and TCblR rs173665 showed associations with infertility. The PEMT variant that was significantly more common in cases is noteworthy because it is a loss of function mutation that has been shown to cause increased tHcy when folate status is marginal. This result suggests that choline metabolism may play a role in idiopathic male infertility. The TCblR variant is also of interest because the minor A allele was also found to be protective against neural tube defects in a recent population-based study. None of the variants that we found to be associated with infertility was associated with significantly poorer semen quality suggesting that these findings require additional investigation.<SEP>Previous studies have produced mixed results regarding the role of folate in male infertility. A randomized controlled trial performed by Landau et al. reported that folic acid supplementation does not improve overall semen quality. Another randomized controlled trial of folic acid and zinc found a 74% increase in the sperm count in the men who took folic acid supplements. An uncontrolled study of folinic acid, 15 mg daily for 3 months, showed a significant improvement in spermatozoa number and motility.<SEP>Somewhat surprisingly, blood folate, B12 and tHcy concentrations in infertile men have not been studied often and the results have been conflicting. One study reported that serum folate and B12 were lower and tHcy was higher in infertile subjects, but a P value was reported only for tHcy. In contrast, a trial to determine whether folic acid could improve sperm parameters reported that fertile and subfertile men had almost identical folate concentrations (18.0 nmol l−1) prior to treatment. A third study reported no difference in blood folate, B12 and tHcy values between their fertile and infertile groups. Our data do not show an association between B12 or tHcy and semen parameters. After adjusting for education, only serum folate, not RCF, was significantly lower in infertile men not taking folic acid supplements. The inclusion of RCF is a major advantage over most previous studies because it provides a long-term (90–120 days) measure of folate status.<SEP>Several limitations of our study should be noted. The infertile men were undergoing fertility evaluations and provided semen samples on a different day than the blood samples. Fertile men provided semen and blood samples on the same day. The lifetime of an erythrocyte is 90–120 days and spermatogenesis takes 72 days, so our RCF measure would reflect the period of spermatogenesis. Abstinence time was not available for 45% of controls. Strengths of our study include the extensive genotyping and biochemical data on a relatively large sample of men carefully screened for known causes of infertility.<SEP>In conclusion, this study provides little support for the importance of low folate or B12 in the pathogenesis of idiopathic male infertility. The role of genetic variants (PEMT and TCblR) in choline and B12 metabolism merits further investigation.<SEP>           AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS         <SEP>RJL, AG, HS, DW-S and JLM conceived and designed the study.

21615938,"Background<SEP>Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) is characterized by a set of symptoms related to the muscles and joints that reside between the mandibular condyle and the temporal bone. The most common symptoms are joint sounds, pain, and limited joint movement.<SEP>According to the NIDCR (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research), 5-12% of the population suffers or has suffered at some time from problems related to temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD). It is considered the most common cause of chronic pain in the orofacial region.<SEP>There are multiple factors that could cause or contribute to TMD disorder, including trauma, several types of arthritis, dental problems, autoimmune diseases, psychological and hormonal factors and also commonly associated with other related symptoms in the head and neck.<SEP>Due to its etiological and symptomatic variety, it is assumed that a combination of factors related to environmental and/or nutritional stress could be an underlying cause of TMD. As for genetic factors, studies of twins and familial segregation suggest that TMD is not a hereditary disease. Nevertheless, individuals are not equally susceptible to TMD, and different genetic variants can increase the predisposition to a particular development of the disorder.<SEP>TMD is a problem that affects women two times more than men and its causes are not completely known. Certain hormones can increase inherent genetic vulnerability to TMD, which explains the larger predisposition of women of reproductive age. The relationship between oestrogens and TMD has been studied previously; specifically, the polymorphisms of the receptor gene ER-α, Pvu II (rs2234693) and Xba I (rs9340799), seem to be related to several forms of osteoarthritis, including TMD.<SEP>Folate metabolism can influences the final form of any growing tissue due not only to its participation in nucleic acid synthesis, but also to its known function in regulating DNA and protein methylation. Folate deficiency can cause central nervous system irritability, depression, weight loss, and anaemia. Nutritional deficiencies and, more specifically, abnormally low levels of vitamins B1, B6, B12, and/or folic acid are considered factors that perpetuate pain and myofascial dysfunction, and these deficiencies are frequent in cases of TMD mechanical stress.<SEP>Other mechanisms that have been related to TMD are factors related to psychopathological and pain perception, which can also be influenced by genetic variability. It has been described that the variants of a polymorphic region linked to gene SLC6A4 of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region, 5-HTTLPR) could be related to pain perception and temporomandibular disorder. The 44 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism of the SLC6A4 gene has been extensively studied and frequently associated with the dopamine receptor gene DRD4; DRD4 variants have been associated with several clinical cases related to behavior, psychopathologies, and pain.<SEP>The following objective was to study the implication of 27 polymorphisms located on 17 genes and their relation with TMD. It has been designed under the hypothesis of that TMD is a multifactorial syndrome related to a critical period of human life that have a genetic and epigenetic basis both associated to folate metabolism, oxidative stress, hormones and neurotransmission.","Methods<SEP>Study design<SEP>A case-control study was designed to evaluate the impact of gene polymorphisms above described on TMD. A total of 229 individuals (69% women) were included at the study; 86 were TMD patients and 143 were healthy control subjects. The sample size was calculated using the prevalence of TMD and allele and genotypes frequencies of the polymorphism selected based on their known frequency in our population.<SEP>Patient recruitment<SEP>Thirty five patients diagnosed with TMD who were admitted consecutively to private dental surgeries ('Clínica Rincon' and 'Clínica Dental Aneiros' in Malaga, Spain), during a period of 8 months were included in this study. In addition, 556 volunteer students from Malaga University (57% female and 43% male) were invited to participate in the study. They answered a questionnaire for TMD (Table 1). Ninety eight individuals responded affirmatively to four o more question of the questionnaire. So, they were invited to be clinically evaluated following the guidelines from The Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) by a dentist who had experience in TMD evaluation. Fourteen subjects were excluded because they could not come to the physical examination and 33 had not clinical signs of TMD. Case group was 86 patients (35 previously diagnosed and 51 diagnosed volunteers), 64 women (74%), mean age 19.4 ± 2.9, and 22 men (26%) mean age 23.6 ± 4.1. Exclusion criteria for TMD patients were clinical history of traumatic injuries on head and neck, cranial anomalies of known or unknown etiology, inflammatory chronical disease component, mental retardation, drug dependence, and somatic or neurological illnesses.<SEP>The control group was built from the volunteers who did not answer affirmatively to any question. All participants were healthy, without any signs or symptoms of TMD and age matched to the TMD group. In short, control group consisted in 143 subjects, 94 women (66%), mean age 19,6 ± 3.3, and 49 men (34%), mean age 22,3 ± 4.1.<SEP>All the participants signed an informed consent form, and their personal data were recorded by interviewers. The study protocol was approved by Ethics Committee of Malaga University and conformed to the Helsinki Declaration.<SEP>Samples and DNA isolation method<SEP>After obtaining informed consent, oral mucosa samples were collected from the 229 subjects. DNA isolation was performed using the salting out method, as described by Martinez et al., applied to the oral mucosa.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>Three platforms were designed to perform the genotyping. Two of them for 20 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP1, SNP2) and the third one for other polymorphisms of 7 gene variants (deletions, insertions, tandem repeat, null genotype). Primers were designed using the primer analysis software Oligo, version 4.0 and synthesized commercially. The primers sequences are shown in table 2. To verify the validity and reliability of the techniques, the quality of each isolated polymorphism was checked in a simplex reaction.<SEP>SNPs<SEP>Genotyping of SNPs was performed by multiplex minisequencing preceded by multiplex PCR. This technique consists of three steps:<SEP>1) Amplification of regions flanking the SNPs by multiplex PCR; PCR reactions were performed in a volume of 10 μL with 100 ng of genomic DNA, 1×Amplitaq Gold ® Buffer (Applied Biosystems), MgCl2 1,5 mM, dNTPs 0,2 mM, 1 unit of Amplitaq Gold® DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and Primer Mix (primer concentrations ranged between 0,1-0,6 μM). Amplification was achieved in a 2720 Thermal Cycler®(Applied Biosystems) and consisted of 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles for 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 58°C; 30 s at 72°C and a final extension for 7 min at 72°C. PCR products were checked in a 2% agarose gel, stained with SYBR® Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) which resulted in 100 to 400 bp sized bands. In order to eliminate the excess of primers and dNTPs, the PCR products were digested by an 'ExoCiAP' mix consisting of 2 units/10 μL PCR E. coli exonuclease I (Exo I, Takara®) and 5 units/10 μLPCR alkaline phosphatase (CiAP, Takara®) incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes. The enzymes were afterwards inactivated by heating at 80°C for 20 minutes<SEP>2) Multiplex mini-sequencing for each locus of the SNP multiplexes (SNP1, SNP2), a mini-sequencing primer with the 3'-end adjacent to the target SNP was designed (see Table 2) to anneal with the PCR product. A mini-sequencing reaction extends this primer, producing different products for each allele. We performed the reaction in a 11 μL volume with 4 μL purified PCR product and 6 μL of the mini-sequencing primers mix (2 pM/μL) and 1 μL of SNaPshot® multiplex kit (Applied Biosystems). The mini-sequencing conditions consisted of 40 cycles at 96°C-10 s; 50°C-7 s; 60°C-30 s. After that, we proceeded to purify the sample using 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase (Takara®) at 37°C for 1 hour and then at 80°C for 20 min.<SEP>3) Analysis of mini-sequencing products by capillary electrophoresis: We mixed 4 μl of the purified mini-sequencing products with 10 μl of HiDi™ formamide and 0.2 μl of GeneScan-120 LIZ size standard (Applied Biosystems) and denatured at 95°C for 5 minutes. The fluorescently labeled products were resolved by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The DS02 matrix (Applied Biosystems) was used at full speed for 17 minutes with 8 seconds of injection. The resulting data were analyzed with GeneMapper™ 4.0 Software (Applied Biosystems).<SEP>Other polymorphisms<SEP>To detect other polymorphisms different from SNPs (deletions, insertions, tandem repeat, null genotype), a multiplex PCR assay was performed under the following concentrations (in a volume of 10 μL): 100 ng of genomic DNA, 1× GoTaq® FlexiBuffer (Promega), MgCl2 1,5 mM, dNTPs 0,2 mM, Primer Mix (primer concentrations ranged between 0,1-0,6 μM), Betaine 50 mM and 1 unit of Go Taq® Flexi DNA Polymerase (Promega). The labeled primers are shown in table 2. Amplification was achieved in a 2720 Thermal Cycler® (Applied Biosystems) and consisted of 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles for 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 58°C; 1 min at 72°C and a final extension for 7 min at 72°C. We mixed 4 μl of PCR products with 10 μl of HiDi™ formamide and 0.2 μL of GeneScan-600 LIZ size standard (Applied Biosystems) and denatured at 95°C for 5 minutes. The fluorescently labeled products were resolved by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The DS33 matrix (Applied Biosystems) was used at full speed for 45 minutes with 5 seconds of injection. The sizes of the alleles were analyzed with GeneMapper Ver. 4.0 (Applied Biosystems) software.<SEP>Statistics<SEP>All analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences statistical software (SPSS v. 16.0 for Macintosh; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). To determine the differences in genotype and allelic frequency of each studied polymorphism between TMD patients and healthy subjects, a chi-square test was used. Any p value < 0.05 was considered as a statistical difference. In those polymorphisms that shown significant difference in genotype, the risk between subjects with TMD and healthy controls was evaluated by Cochran's-Haenzel odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval using sex as confounding factor.","Results<SEP>Genotyping was performed for the 229 individuals. The results are summarized in Table 3. Not all of the samples were valid for all genotypes, because of that, the number of individuals can vary from one polymorphism to another.<SEP>Serine Hidroximetil Transferase 1 gene (SHMT1)<SEP>This enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of serine to glycine, transferring methyl groups to tetrahydrofolate (THF), which is transformed into 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF). During cellular proliferation, this is the predominant pathway for pyrimidine synthesis (see Figure 1).<SEP>From the four polymorphisms studied on the cytoplasmic SHMT1 in TMD patients, a significant increase was observed of the G allele of the polymorphism rs1979277 (Leu435Phe) when compared with controls (OR = 3.99; 95% CI 1.72, 9.25; p = 0,002). Regarding the polymorphism SHMT1 rs638416 of the promoter region (5'-UTR), a very significant increase was observed of the C allele and the CC genotype in TMD patients (OR = 2.80; 95% CI 1.51, 5.21; p = 0,013). Both polymorphisms are not linked, so their frequencies can be measured independently as a risk factor for TMD.<SEP>Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 gene (MTHFD1)<SEP>The MTHFD1 gene encodes a protein that has three distinct enzyme activities: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate-synthetase. Each of these activities catalyzes one of three interconversion reactions of one-carbon derivatives of THF, which are substrates for the synthesis of methionine, thymidylate and purines. The trifunctional enzymatic activity is conferred by two larger domains: a terminal amino portion with dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities and a larger domain with synthetase activity.<SEP>The transition from G to A (rs2236225) in the MTHFD1 gene that results in an alteration of ARG-653-GLN is clinically associated with susceptibility to neural tube defects (NTDs) sensitive to folates. In our study, we found statistical differences in the alleles and genotypes frequencies between TMD patients and healthy controls. The T allele was more frequent in TMD patients (OR = 3.09; 95% CI 1.27, 7.50; p = 0,016).<SEP>Glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) gene<SEP>This gene encodes mu-class glutathione S-transferase. Its function is the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, drugs, toxins, and products of oxidative stress, by the conjugation with glutathione.<SEP>The GSTM1-null polymorphism is a deletion of the GSTM1 gene. The null variant of this gene has been associated with an increase of cancer and male infertility possibly due to greater susceptibility to environmental toxins and carcinogens as well as an alteration in the toxicity and efficiency of certain substances.<SEP>Our study found a statistical increase (OR = 2.21; 95% CI 1.24, 4.36; p = 0.030) of the null variant in TMD patients compared to the control group.<SEP>Methionine Synthase Reductase (MTRR) gene<SEP>MTRR is responsible for the regeneration of Methionine Synthase (MTR) by reductive methylation using SAM as a methyl donor.<SEP>The substitution of A by G (rs1801394) in the encoding region is translated in Ile22Met. The G allele produces an enzyme with less affinity for the substrate. A statistical increase of the A allele (OR = 2.35; 95% CI 1.10, 5.00; p = 0.037) was observed in the TMD group.<SEP>D4 receptor of Dopamine (DRD4) gene<SEP>DRD4-48bptr is the 48-bp VNTR in exon 3 of the DRD4, which encodes the third intracellular receptor loop and presents between 2 to 11 repeats. According to the number of repetitions, we can characterize the polymorphism as the short allele S-DRD4 (2 to 5 repetitions) and the long allele L-DRD4 (6 or more repeats). It was observed statistical differences on genotype frequencies in both groups (p = 0,039), but no statistical increase (OR = 3.12; 95% IC 0.76, 17.26, p = 0.181) of the S-DRD4 allele was found in patient group. The LL genotype was not found in any of the individuals with TMD.","Discussion<SEP>Temporomandibular disorder has been associated with psychological dysfunctions, and sexual dimorphism. Its occurrence also appears to coincide with puberty. Currently, controversy exists as to the importance of underlying genetic and environmental nutritional factors, such as vitamin intake. The folate-methionine axis takes part in both factors. In this axis, there are several polymorphic variants of the enzymes involved that together with folate dietary intake determines the metabolism of the axis. Furthermore, the transfer of methyl groups to DNA and proteins is one of the limiting factors for the correct development of the proliferating tissues. Therefore the latter is key for the continuous tissue growth and epigenetic modifications.<SEP>This work studied the implication of 27 polymorphisms located on 17 genes and their relation with TMD. It has been designed under the hypothesis of that TMD is a multifactorial syndrome related to a critical period of human life that have a genetic and epigenetic basis. The study of genes related to folate cycle is directly involved in the two ways: the genetic, by gene polymorphisms, and epigenetic by the nutritional habits because of the folate intake. Deficit of folate intake is known as the most prevalent vitamin deficit in human. The majority of the genes studied were related to folate metabolism even though there were others related to oxidative metabolism and hormonal and neurotransmission receptors. Of the17 genes studied of the folate cycle, 3 of them (SHMT, MTHFD, MTRR) showed significant associations with TMD. Significant changes in the allele and genotype frequencies between the TMD patients and controls were found.<SEP>SHMT catalyzes a reversible step of THF to 5,10-CH2-THF, which is a key substrate to obtain 5-methyl-THF and synthesize thymidylate. On the other hand, MTHFD1 provides the 5, 10CH2-THF substrate in addition to having a central role in the cycle due to its triple functionality. The 5-methyl-THF to methionine step is catalyzed by MTR in cooperation with TCN and MTRR, which are essential for the participation of vitamin B12 as a cofactor and the reactivation of MTR, respectively.<SEP>In our case, a higher significant frequency of the allele SHMT-rs1979277G was observed in TMD patients (0.67 vs 0.53). The Allele G has been related to higher levels of folates and homocysteine, this could mean that the enzyme activity is deviated to the THF and glycine synthesis versus to the serine and 5,10CH3THF substrate of the MTHFR which provide 5'CH3THF needed to the methionine synthesis by mean of homocysteine. The increase of homocysteine, classified as an oxidant, could favour inflamatory process. However the effect of this polymorphism on enzyme activity is still controverted.<SEP>Statistical differences were also observed in allelic frequency of the C allele the SNP rs638416, in the promoter region of the SHMT gene. SHMT not only provides one-carbon units for thymidylate biosynthesis but also generates a pool of methylenetetrahydrofolate for SAM synthesis by means of serine synthesis. In addition, the SHMT gene has the capacity to sequester 5-methyl-THF and therefore inhibit the synthesis of methionine and SAM, which is the methyl donor for DNA and proteins. Therefore, greater SHMT activity would produce higher 5-methyl-THF sequestration, which would reduce SAM synthesis. Cellular deficits of SAM could induce lesser methylation on the novo synthetized DNA on inflamatory tissues, which can take to higher gene expresión levels, generating a positive feedback on inflammation and pain.<SEP>TMD patients and healthy controls had very significantly different genotypic frequencies of the SNP rs2236225 of the MTHFD gene. The triple functionality of the MTHFD enzyme and the central role it plays in the folate cycle make it one of the key points for the balance of this metabolic route. Therefore, it is not difficult to believe that any genetic alteration that affects its expression or activity would have consequences for methyl transfer and consequently on epigenesis.<SEP>The results of the present work show that the polymorphic variants SHMT-rs1979277, rs638416, and MTHFD1-rs2236225 found in the folate cycle were significantly associated with TMD. They coincided with a global decrease in the availability of methyl groups via a decrease of the substrate 5,10-CH2-THF (SHMT and MTHFD1), while the SNP MTRR-rs1801394 did not follow the same pattern. The wild allele A, predominant in TMD, which means greater efficiency in the pathway of homocysteine to methionine, has the same final effect of the variants of SHMT and MTHFD, an increase of THF levels.<SEP>TMD have been associated to oxidative stress of the temporomandibular joint. Regarding GTSM1, we found a significant number of individuals with TMD (OD = 2.21; 95%CI 1.24, 4.35; p = 0.030) with the null variant of the gene. It has been published that oxidative stress, which leads to the production of NO and peroxynitrite, is harmful to DNA in response to the excessive mechanical overload, which in turn promotes synovial hyperplasia in the temporomandibular joint. This suggests that a reduced detoxification capacity would make us more susceptible to TMD.<SEP>Previous studies on associations of TMD with alpha ESR1 polymorphisms have shown different results. One of them find a predisposition to TMD associated to ESR1 polymorphism in women others find a relation between pain or craniofacial morphology in TMD women with ESR1 polymorphism, however other recent report does not find this association. In the present study there were no statistical differences in their individualized allelic and genotypic frequencies or in the distinct haplotype combinations. However, a study on the association between these polymorphisms and the predisposition to TMD has recently been published and deepens the characterization of the diplotypes using novel mathematic algorithms, which we will take into account in future studies.<SEP>In contrast to others authors, significant variations were not found in the frequencies of the 5-HTTLPR (serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region) polymorphism of the serotonin receptor gene SCL6A4. However, we found a significant variation in the 48-bp VNTR polymorphism of the DRD4 gene. This polymorphism has been associated with pain processes, such as fibromyalgia and migraine.",21309,"['VITMIN', 'FOODIN']"
30053280,"Introduction<SEP>Historically, 3 main types of methods have been used for serum folate (S-FOL) and whole-blood folate (WB-FOL) measurement: microbiological assay (MBA), protein-binding or immunoassay, and chromatography-based assay. The fully automated protein-binding assays are performed on clinical analyzers, offer high sample throughput, and have generally good precision; however, these assays are not harmonized among manufacturers, have questionable accuracy, suffer from lot-to-lot variations, and incur a relatively high cost for the instrumentation and a moderate cost for the reagent kits. The chromatography-based methods are characterized by high specificity, sensitivity, and precision, but they are expensive to conduct and require complex sample preparation and a highly trained analyst. The MBA has been considered the gold-standard method for folate measurement since the 1960s, because it responds similarly to all biologically active folate forms in blood, needs only a small sample volume, and can be conducted with the use of simple laboratory equipment. Several important improvements during the 1970s made this assay more robust and easier to perform, such as the development of an antibiotic-resistant strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (formerly called Lactobacillus casei) to avoid the use of a septic assay procedure and sterile supplies, the cryopreservation of the microorganism to allow frozen storage of larger quantities of inoculum for better long-term assay stability, and the assay setup on a 96-well plate format to significantly improve efficiency and to allow automated pipetting for greatly improved throughput. All these characteristics make the MBA a good candidate for folate measurement in nutrition surveys and especially suitable for low-resource laboratories.<SEP>Assessing folate status in the population has historically been an important component of nutrition surveys. In 2015, the WHO published a new guideline for optimal serum and red blood cell folate levels in women of childbearing age for the prevention of neural tube defects. There is also interest in population monitoring over concerns of potential adverse effects of high levels of folate. As a result, an increasing interest in the global assessment of population folate status is anticipated. Thus, an accurate, stable, and practical folate method is needed to generate reliable data that are comparable across time and location. The folate MBA was recommended by WHO to assess folate status in population surveys. However, few laboratories to date use the MBA and they typically set up their own in-house procedures. It has been shown that MBA results from 3 laboratories who used their own procedures and reagents were not interchangeable. The 2 laboratories using the chloramphenicol-resistant L. rhamnosus microorganism produced well-correlated (r > 0.9) but systematically different results, whereas the laboratory using the wild-type microorganism produced less well-correlated (r ≤ 0.8) and different results. The main objective of this folate “round-robin” study was to investigate the among-laboratory variability from a larger number of laboratories and to assess whether laboratories can generate more comparable folate results if they use a common calibrator and microorganism.","Methods<SEP>Participating laboratories<SEP>In 2015, the CDC invited 8 laboratories that were proficient in carrying out the folate MBA and routinely used the L. rhamnosus chloramphenicol-resistant microorganism in their laboratory to participate in a round-robin inter-laboratory comparison study. However, 1 of the invited laboratories reported using the wild-type L. rhamnosus microorganism. Given the paucity of MBA comparison data, we included this laboratory in the study, but treated their data separately.<SEP>CDC round-robin kit<SEP>Microorganism.<SEP>Each participating laboratory received a folate MBA kit prepared by the CDC laboratory. The kit contained 6 vials of frozen CDC microorganism inoculum [L. rhamnosus, NCIMB (National Collections of Industrial, Marine and Food Bacteria) 10463, CDC-MO]. The microorganism was originally received from St. James Hospital, Dublin, Ireland in 2000, and it has been subcultured at the CDC laboratory since then. To maintain the original characteristics of the microorganism, we prepared ≤2 subcultures from the originally received vials. To prepare a new inoculum, an aliquot of the microorganism was added to Folic Acid Casei Medium (Becton Dickinson, NJ) and the culture suspension was grown at 37°C. When the culture reached log phase of growth (at ~18–20 h, optical density of ~0.35–0.7), the culture suspension was mixed with 80% glycerol at a 50:50 ratio, and 1-mL aliquots were frozen at −70°C. We typically prepare a few hundred aliquots, one of which is used each time an assay is set up.<SEP>Calibrator.<SEP>The kit contained 6 vials of CDC calibrator stock solution of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate [5-methylTHF, 1 μmol/L in 0.5% ascorbic acid (wt/vol), CDC-CAL]. The solid folate compound was obtained from Merck & Cie (Schaffhausen, Switzerland) and had a reported purity of >98%. A primary stock solution at ~200 μg/mL in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was value assigned by spectrophotometry (wavelength of 290 nm, absorptivity coefficient of 31,700). Ascorbic acid (1% wt/vol) was added to the primary stock solution and the stock solution was diluted with 0.5% ascorbic acid (wt/vol) to a 1 μmol/L intermediary stock solution which was stored at −70°C for ≤6 mo, at which time a fresh intermediary stock solution was generated from an aliquot of the primary stock solution.<SEP>Biological samples.<SEP>We screened serum and EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood from healthy adult blood donors obtained from Tennessee Blood Services (Memphis, TN) for folate concentrations using the CDC MBA. Samples were not spiked with folate, nor were donors asked to take any vitamin supplements prior to donating blood. We selected 23 serum and 23 whole-blood samples for the round-robin study with a relatively wide range of folate concentrations: ~9–90 nmol/L for S-FOL and ~180–700 nmol/L for WB-FOL. The whole-blood samples were further diluted and hemolyzed with 1% ascorbic acid (wt/vol) at a 1:11 ratio. We prepared several hundred serum and whole-blood hemolysate aliquots (0.5 mL/vial) and labeled each vial with a “blinded” 7-digit random ID. Each round-robin kit contained 2 sets of 23 serum and whole-blood hemolysate samples each for 2 d of analysis (the 2 sets were boxed in a different sequence). All kits were stored at −70°C and shipped frozen on dry ice to the participating laboratories. Laboratories acknowledged the receipt of the shipment and its condition and immediately transferred the kit to a freezer.<SEP>Laboratory analysis<SEP>CDC MBA.<SEP>Given that there is a lack of a “reference point” for total folate concentrations, we utilized the CDC MBA (laboratory #1) as a comparison method in the round-robin study. The CDC laboratory measured each of the 23 serum and whole-blood hemolysate samples in duplicate over multiple days (10–15 d for serum and 11–30 d for whole blood) using the CDC-MO and CDC-CAL (5-methyltetrahydrofolate) to assign target values. The total CV ranged from 7.0–15% and from 5.2–12% for the 23 serum and whole-blood samples, respectively. In short, diluted sample or calibrator is added to culture medium that is inoculated with microorganism and contains all the nutrients necessary for the growth of L. rhamnosus except for folate. The 96-well plates are incubated at 37°C for ~42 h. Since the growth of L. rhamnosus is proportional to the amount of total folate present in the sample, the total folate concentration is assessed by measuring the turbidity of the inoculated medium at 590 nm in a microplate reader. The sample folate concentration is calculated from an 11-point polynomial calibration curve generated with 5-methylTHF. Two dilutions, each prepared in duplicate, are used for each sample.<SEP>CDC HPLC-MS/MS.<SEP>We also analyzed the 23 serum samples by the CDC HPLC-MS/MS method in duplicate on 2 separate days (n = 4) to confirm the previously shown agreement with the CDC MBA. Serum total folate was calculated as the sum of the individual folate forms (5-methylTHF, folic acid, tetrahydrofolate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate) not including the pyrazino-s-triazine derivative of 4α-hydroxy-5-methylTHF because this form is not detected by the MBA. For whole-blood folate, unresolved issues with the current HPLC-MS/MS method precluded its consideration for comparison with the CDC MBA at this time.<SEP>Other laboratories.<SEP>All participating laboratories used their in-house (IH) MBA protocol, instruments, consumables, and reagents to analyze the samples. CDC provided detailed instructions. The 23 serum samples were analyzed in single measurement on 2 separate days. Then, the same experiments were repeated for the 23 whole-blood samples. To allow a direct comparison of 2 microorganism inoculums (IH compared with CDC) and 2 calibrators (IH compared with CDC), 4 test conditions were assayed together each day to minimize the day-to-day variation of reagent preparation: IH microorganism and IH calibrator (IH-MO & IH-CAL), IH-MO & CDC-CAL, CDC-MO & IH-CAL, and CDC-MO & CDC-CAL (Supplemental Figure 1). The CDC instructions suggested that laboratories use a sample dilution of 1:100 for serum and 1:140 for whole-blood hemolysate samples; however, laboratories were allowed to choose their desired sample dilutions. CDC provided each laboratory with a customized report template containing their individual sample IDs and requested that laboratories report the measured folate concentrations in nanomoles per liter. Laboratories also reported information on their IH-MO and IH-CAL, how many replicates per sample they prepared, what sample dilution they used, whether they used IH quality control or blank samples, and any other relevant information on assay procedures.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>The study was designed to assess the repeatability of each method and to compare S-FOL and WB-FOL concentrations at 4 test conditions within and among laboratories. To assess method imprecision, we calculated the CV (mean ± SD) for the 2 d of analysis for each of the 23 samples, and then calculated the arithmetic mean CV and SD of CV for each laboratory and condition. For subsequent analyses a natural log transformation was used to account for the heterogeneous variance over the span of folate concentrations. The geometric mean and geometric CV (across the 23 samples) were calculated separately for each laboratory and condition and summarized by the arithmetic mean and SD of the estimated geometric mean across the laboratories.<SEP>Due to the heterogeneity across the laboratories and the complexity of the experimental design, simple descriptive analyses cannot appropriately estimate the effect and variability due to differences in the microorganism and/or calibrators across all the laboratories. Therefore, a linear mixed model was used that combined all the repeated measurements (log transformed) across all the laboratories. The model included a heterogeneous compound symmetry structure for the variance-covariance matrix and controlled for day, test condition, the natural log of the target value, and the interaction between the natural log of the target value and the test condition. This model provided an opportunity to estimate the pooled effect of the different test conditions as well as providing estimates of among-laboratory variability under the various test conditions. Statistical inferences were primarily based on the estimated effect’s 95% CI.<SEP>The CDC MBA target values were computed as the arithmetic mean of measurements made on the 23 samples over >10 runs and were treated in the subsequent models as measured without error. In order to estimate the percentage of difference (and 95% CI) from the target value for each laboratory, a separate linear mixed model was fitted for each laboratory through use of the repeated measurements on 23 samples provided for each of the 4 test conditions. The mean structure was modeled with the following terms: day, test condition, and the natural log of the target value. In addition, an interaction between the natural log of the target value and the test condition was included. For each laboratory, the covariance structure was based on a heterogeneous compound symmetry structure in which a common random effect for sample was specified and each test condition had a unique residual variance. These models provided estimates (and 95% CIs) for the percentage of difference between the measurements and the target.<SEP>When all laboratories were harmonized to the CDC-MO and CDC-CAL, the arithmetic mean and 95% limit of agreement for the difference (with the use of the mean of the 2 daily measurements on the log scale) from the target (log scale) were computed across the 23 samples for each laboratory. These results were back transformed to a ratio and reported in graphical form. Due to the replication (2 d), the SD of these differences was calculated with an adjustment so that the 95% limits of agreement are not artificially narrow due to averaging. Similarly, the mean and 95% limit of agreement for the difference between the paired measurements made at day 1 and day 2 (log scale) were computed across the 23 samples for each laboratory.<SEP>Data from the laboratory using a wild-type L. rhamnosus strain were included in descriptive tables and figures, but excluded from group mean calculations across laboratories, as well as from modeling analyses to estimate the effect and variability due to differences in the microorganism and/or calibrators across the laboratories.","Results<SEP>Comparison of serum folate measured by CDC MBA and CDC HPLC-MS/MS<SEP>The Pearson correlation between the 2 methods was very high (r = 0.999) for the 23 serum samples (Figure 1) and the agreement between the 2 methods was very good (Supplemental Table 1). On average (SD), the CDC MBA measured 0.46% (3.0%) higher than the CDC HPLC-MS/MS method. The CDC HPLC-MS/MS method showed lower imprecision for the 23 serum samples (1.2–4.0%) compared with the CDC MBA (7.0–15.0%).<SEP>Participating laboratories<SEP>All 8 laboratories reported results; 7 laboratories were international and 1 was from the US (Table 1). Two types of IH-CAL were used among laboratories, thus we separated the participants into group 1 (laboratories #2–#5) using 5-methylTHF and group 2 (laboratories #6–#9) using folic acid. Laboratory #3 used the wild-type strain of L. rhamnosus [ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) 7469], whereas the other laboratories used the chloramphenicol-resistant strain (NCIMB 10463); however, the source of their microorganism varied. All laboratories used a 96-well microplate format; some used manual pipetting, whereas others used a sample handler to dilute and pipette. Additional details on laboratory procedures were reported by the participants (Supplemental Table 2). All laboratories value-assigned their folate calibrators by spectrophotometry, at 290 nm for 5-methylTHF and 277–282 nm for folic acid. The culture medium is a critical reagent and was reported to be the same for all laboratories (Folic Acid Casei Medium). According to each procedure, samples were first diluted and then transferred into 96-well plates at 2 different concentrations. Three laboratories (#2, #3, and #9) used the CDC recommended sample dilutions of 1:100 for serum and 1:140 for whole-blood hemolysate, whereas other laboratories used their laboratory-specific dilutions. Most laboratories incubated assay plates at 37°C for 42–45 h, except for laboratory #3 which used only an 18-h incubation. Most laboratories used 590 nm to read plates and all laboratories reported that they carefully controlled the timing for plate reading to ensure consistency across all plates. Most laboratories used a polynomial regression (third-order) calibration curve fit, but other approaches were also reported.<SEP>Within-laboratory imprecision<SEP>A smaller number of laboratories exceeded the 10% CV mark, an indicator for increased within-laboratory imprecision, when they used the CDC reagents (CDC-MO & CDC-CAL) compared with IH reagents (IH-MO & IH-CAL): 6 laboratories (#5 and #8 for S-FOL and #2, #3, #4, and #8 for WB-FOL) compared with 3 laboratories (#3, #4, and #8 for WB-FOL) (Table 2). Furthermore, the overall mean within-laboratory imprecision appeared to be smaller in the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition compared with the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition: 6.3% compared with 9.2% for S-FOL and 7.7% compared with 10.4% for WB-FOL. When only 1 of the 2 reagents was harmonized (conditions IH-MO & CDC-CAL and CDC-MO & IH-CAL), we observed intermediate imprecision estimates. The group mean within-laboratory imprecision was <10% regardless of condition and whether laboratories belonged to group 1 (5-methylTHF calibrator) or group 2 (folic acid calibrator), except for group 1 laboratories that used IH reagents (IH-MO & IH-CAL; 11.2% for S-FOL; 12.9% for WB-FOL) or their IH microorganism (IH-MO & CDC-CAL; 10.2% for S-FOL; 11.2% for WB-FOL).<SEP>Agreement across laboratories<SEP>When we grouped the raw results by laboratory and condition and displayed the distribution of concentrations, there was more variability among the laboratories (wider range of results and fluctuations in the median) under the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition and less variability under the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition, for both S-FOL (Supplemental Figure 2) and WB-FOL (Supplemental Figure 3). Similarly, the geometric mean concentrations spanned a wider range for the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition (23.2–37.6 nmol/L for S-FOL and 267–521 nmol/L for WB-FOL) compared with the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition (27.1–36.2 nmol/L for S-FOL and 315–498 nmol/L for WB-FOL) (Table 3). Larger apparent differences were observed between the means for group 1 (5-methylTHF calibrator) and group 2 (folic acid calibrator) laboratories under the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition (30.2 nmol/L compared with 35.3 nmol/L for S-FOL and 428 nmol/L compared with 469 nmol/L for WB-FOL) compared with the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition (29.8 nmol/L compared with 30.7 nmol/L for S-FOL and 393 nmol/L compared with 418 nmol/L for WB-FOL). The 2 mixed conditions, IH-MO & CDC-CAL and CDC-MO & IH-CAL, generally showed intermediate results. The mean laboratory results when laboratories used CDC reagents appeared to be closer to the CDC MBA target concentrations (27.0 nmol/L for S-FOL and 358 nmol/L for WB-FOL) than when they used IH reagents. We also noticed an improvement in the overall variance (SD) of the geometric means from the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition to the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition (5.38 nmol/L compared with 3.30 nmol/L for S-FOL and 67.5 nmol/L compared with 46.1 nmol/L for WB-FOL). Lastly, the log transformed results for the 23 serum and whole-blood samples sorted by increasing CDC MBA target concentration displayed the same pattern; the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition showed a separation between results from group 1 and group 2 laboratories, whereas the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition generated more comparable results (Supplemental Figure 4).<SEP>Estimated effect size and variability due to differences in microorganism and calibrator<SEP>We estimated the magnitude of the pooled effects of each of the test conditions, such as the day, microorganism, and calibrator (Table 4). The model estimated a small day effect of ~5% for S-FOL and ~2% for WB-FOL, with day 1 results being lower than day 2 results. The overall microorganism effect (averaging across calibrators) was also small, but the large 95% CIs attested to the underlying variability within and among laboratories: S-FOL 2.28% (−11.4%, 18.1%) and WB-FOL 2.25% (−10.0%, 16.2%). The overall calibrator effect (averaging across microorganisms) was small when 5-methylTHF as IH-CAL was compared with CDC-CAL (also 5-methylTHF), but again showed large 95% CIs: S-FOL −2.33% (−20.7%, 20.3%) and WB-FOL −0.212% (−16.2%, 18.8%). The overall calibrator was large and also showed large 95% CIs when folic acid as IH-CAL was compared with 5-methylTHF calibrator: S-FOL 12.1% (−2.08%, 28.4%) and WB-FOL 14.7% (0.438%, 31.0%).<SEP>The among-laboratory variability was evaluated for 6 test conditions by separating the IH-CAL condition into either 5-methylTHF or folic acid (Table 5). The model estimated the lowest (~10%) variability for S-FOL and WB-FOL when laboratories used both CDC reagents. The condition with the highest variability was when IH-MO and 5-methylTHF as IH-CAL were used (21.9% for S-FOL; 17.9% for WB-FOL).<SEP>Difference compared with CDC MBA target values<SEP>The model-estimated relative difference in S-FOL compared with the CDC MBA target value varied greatly by laboratory and in most cases also by condition (Figure 2A). However, laboratories #3 and to some extent #7 showed little variation by condition. On the other hand, laboratories #2, #4, and #8 showed a clear microorganism effect, whereas laboratories #5 and #9 showed a calibrator effect. We observed different patterns for the model-estimated relative difference in WB-FOL compared with the CDC MBA target value (Figure 3A). Laboratories #2, #4, and to some extent #7 showed little variation by condition. On the other hand, laboratory #3 showed a microorganism effect, whereas laboratories #8 and #9 showed a clear calibrator effect. When we grouped results by condition (Figure 2B for S-FOL; Figure 3B for WB-FOL), all laboratories under the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition were estimated to achieve on average results within ±20% of the CDC MBA target value except for laboratory #6 (34% higher for S-FOL and 38% higher for WB-FOL) (Supplemental Table 3). Laboratories #2, #4, #7, and #8 obtained, on average, results within 10% of the CDC MBA target, for both S-FOL and WB-FOL. For group 1 laboratories (5-methylTHF calibrator), the mean difference to the CDC MBA target value was estimated to be 21% for S-FOL and 18% for WB-FOL with the use of IH reagents. This decreased to an estimated 9.9% for S-FOL and 9.0% for WB-FOL with the use of CDC reagents. For group 2 laboratories (folic acid calibrator), the mean difference to the CDC MBA target value was 30% for S-FOL and 30% for WB-FOL with the use of IH reagents. This decreased to 13% for S-FOL and 16% for WB-FOL with the use of CDC reagents. Overall, when all laboratories used IH reagents, the mean ± SD difference to the CDC MBA target value decreased from 22% ± 20% for S-FOL and 25% ± 19% for WB-FOL to 12% ± 12% for S-FOL and 13% ± 13% for WB-FOL with the use of CDC reagents. When only 1 of the 2 reagents was harmonized, we observed an intermediate estimated mean difference to the CDC MBA target value as well as an intermediate SD.<SEP>Harmonized condition<SEP>The limits of agreement indicate the range within which 95% of the results are expected to be when compared with the CDC MBA target value (Figure 4A) when the laboratories used CDC reagents. We found overall reasonable agreement among laboratories (limits of agreement including 1) under the harmonized condition when all laboratories used the same microorganism and calibrator provided in the CDC round-robin kit (CDC-MO & CDC-CAL) except for laboratories #6 and #9. For all other laboratories, 95% of the results were predicted to be between ~30% lower and ~50% higher than the CDC MBA target value, regardless of the matrix. Furthermore, with the harmonized condition it can be expected that the differences between 2 d of analysis would be approximately ±10–30% for S-FOL and approximately ±20–40% for WB-FOL (Figure 4B). Laboratory #8 results for WB-FOL showed a lack of agreement between day 1 and day 2.","Discussion<SEP>This round-robin study presents S-FOL and WB-FOL MBA results from 8 experienced international laboratories plus the CDC laboratory and is to our knowledge the first systematic investigation into the precision and comparability of the MBA conducted in different laboratories before and after harmonizing 2 key reagents: the microorganism and the calibrator. Although our intention was to only recruit laboratories who used the chloramphenicol-resistant strain of L. rhamnosus (NCIMB 10463), we seized the opportunity to include 1 laboratory that used the wild-type strain. Though that laboratory produced similar results to other laboratories and to the CDC MBA for S-FOL, it produced the lowest results of all laboratories for WB-FOL. However, this seemed to be only partially explained by the microorganism, as results were still 13% lower compared with the CDC MBA for the harmonized condition and may be explained by procedural differences (e.g., shorter incubation time of 18 h).<SEP>For the other laboratories using the chloramphenicol-resistant strain, we found differences in microorganism response in some but not all laboratories. This may be due to different characteristics of the microorganism. Laboratories have procured their microorganism from different sources and have, in some cases, subcultured the microorganism for decades and over several generations (e.g., laboratory #7). The number of subcultures may be quite different among laboratories and it is therefore impossible to know the exact microorganism quality, originality, and its response to folate forms. It has been shown previously that the form of folate used during the development of methotrexate resistance affected the response of the assay organism to folate. Not only did we observe apparent microorganism differences among laboratories (e.g., laboratory #8 measured ~30% higher with their IH-MO compared with the CDC-MO, whereas laboratory #4 measured ~20% lower), we also noted different calibration curve shapes for several IH-MO compared with the CDC-MO (data not shown). The CDC-MO provided in the round-robin kit was subcultured in our laboratory over a maximum of 2 generations and we compared its performance to original microorganism purchased from ATCC and subcultured in our laboratory. Through the use of ~300 whole blood samples analyzed over 6 assays we found an average difference between the 2 microorganisms of ~1%.<SEP>O’Broin and Kelleher reported in 1992 that the chloramphenicol-resistant L. casei (later renamed L. rhamnosus) showed similar response to different folate forms, such as folic acid and 5-methylTHF. However, more recent studies reported that L. rhamnosus showed a lower response to folic acid compared with 5-methlyTHF and thus calibration with folic acid produced ~25% higher folate results. This round-robin study included laboratories using either 5-methylTHF or folic acid as IH-CAL. We confirmed a systematic difference between the 2 folate forms regardless of which microorganism was used. When folic acid was employed as a calibrator, results were estimated to be higher (on average ~12% for S-FOL and 20% for WB-FOL) compared with the use of 5-methylTHF. Because 5-methylTHF is the major folate form in both serum and whole blood, we believe that more accurate results will be generated when 5-methylTHF is used as calibrator for the MBA.<SEP>The harmonized condition showed an improvement in within-laboratory method imprecision compared with laboratories using their own reagents for 5 of 7 laboratories for S-FOL and WB-FOL (not including laboratory #3). Furthermore, the mean within-laboratory CV across the 7 laboratories decreased from 9.2% to 6.3% for S-FOL and from 10.4% to 7.7% for WB-FOL. This was not necessarily expected because a large determinant of the imprecision is the procedure, which wasn’t changed from the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition to the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition. However, another determinant is the robustness of the procedure and it can be influenced by the reagents used. It appears that the combination of CDC-MO and CDC-CAL improved the robustness of the procedure for most but not all laboratories. Laboratories that already displayed a CV of ~5% with the use of IH reagents, did not show a further improvement with the use of CDC reagents. All 7 laboratories achieved a CV of <10% for S-FOL with the harmonized condition, which is excellent. For WB-FOL, the CV was >10% for 2 laboratories, but this is not unusual.<SEP>The harmonized condition showed the lowest estimated among-laboratory variability for S-FOL (~10%). A 10–15% among-laboratory variability on the same “assay platform” is comparable to or better than what is seen with commercial protein-binding assays in proficiency testing programs. Depending on the clinical analyzer platform, the within-platform among-laboratory CV covers a range of ~7–30% for S-FOL and 10–50% for WB-FOL. The harmonized condition also showed a notable improvement in the agreement with the CDC MBA target value: the mean difference to the target value was approximately half (12% for S-FOL and 13% for WB-FOL) of what it was when laboratories used their IH reagents (22% for S-FOL and 25% for WB-FOL). Furthermore, except for laboratory #6, all laboratories were within ±20% of the CDC MBA target value. The consistently higher results of laboratory #6 for both S-FOL and WB-FOL under all 4 conditions may indicate a systematic difference in the assay procedure. Achieving good agreement among laboratories is a critical requirement to enable meaningful comparisons of survey data across laboratories or countries as well as over time to assess the impact of nutrition interventions. If different commercial protein-binding assays were currently used to assess global folate status, the expected variability across different assay platforms based on available proficiency testing data would be much larger (~1.5- to 6-fold and 8- to 40-fold differences for S-FOL and RBC-FOL, respectively) than what could be achieved with a harmonized MBA.<SEP>We don’t know how much further the agreement among laboratories could be improved if MBA procedures were harmonized in addition to critical reagents. Although we noted differences among laboratories on various procedural aspects, we did not systematically investigate these factors in our modeling. Similarly, the descriptive data did not provide an indication that these factors may explain either differences or variability: use of automated or semi-automated pipetting equipment compared with manual pipetting, use of different calibration curve fits, use of different sample dilutions, and use of a background control. These questions could be explored in future studies. Because the MBA requires extensive pipetting, it is critical to accurately calibrate and regularly verify pipettes and to use excellent pipetting technique.<SEP>In summary, based on results from 8 laboratories, the use of a harmonized microorganism and calibrator in conjunction with laboratory-specific procedures demonstrated improved and acceptable among-laboratory variability for both S-FOL and WB-FOL. The residual variability may be explained by different laboratory procedures and random variability. This study has several strengths: we used 4 test conditions in the same experiment to better understand the effect of altering the microorganism and/or calibrator; we used 23 native serum and whole blood samples each and the samples covered a reasonable concentration range and were analyzed in replication; the participating laboratories had years of experience conducting the MBA; and we obtained excellent agreement for serum folate between the CDC MBA and the CDC HPLC-MS/MS methods, increasing the confidence that the MBA achieves accurate results for this sample matrix. The study also has shortcomings. First, the CDC round-robin kit did not provide a folic acid calibrator; however, including yet another variable would have complicated the design possibly beyond what could realistically be done in a daily experiment. Second, replication beyond just 2 d of analysis would have provided more reliable method imprecision information, but again, this was in conflict with keeping the effort for each laboratory at a reasonable level. It should be pointed out that during routine operating procedures laboratories will unlikely analyze samples over 2 d; thus, our results may show slightly improved performance. Third, the study only included a small number of laboratories because there are not many laboratories conducting the MBA. Possibly the most important shortcoming was that we had to use CDC MBA target values as a comparison point because there are no certified reference materials available for total folate. We can therefore not yet assess “trueness”. However, once such materials become available, it should be possible to “recalibrate” the MBA, if necessary. To facilitate the introduction of the harmonized condition in routine laboratory analyses, it would be desirable to make a folate MBA kit that contains an appropriately characterized calibrator and microorganism available for use in population health studies and to establish a network of regional resource laboratories who are trained, harmonized, and available to reliably analyze S-FOL and WB-FOL by MBA for high-quality assessments of folate status.",33248,['VITMIN']
32334487,"Introduction<SEP>According to the studies, breast cancer has been recently one of the commonest types of cancer with continuous prevalence throughout the world. Moreover, this cancer is the main cause of cancer-associated deaths among women (Pedraza et al., 2012). Considering the previous investigations, an annual diagnosis of approximately 1.15 million patients with breast cancer diagnosed has been reported, with the maximum occurrence of breast cancer in the USA and Europe (Siegel et al., 2012; Song et al., 2016). However, breast cancer prevalence is quickly increasing in the People’s Republic of China (Yang et al., 2003). Also, in Iranian women, breast cancer is considered the most common malignancies especially in younger women (Akbari et al., 2017). <SEP>The pathologic factors of breast cancer are not well understood, though some reports referred to the genetic and environmental parameters as the causes of breast cancer (Mettlin, 1999; Sharif et al., 2016). One of the significant factors of the genetic susceptibility to cancer is the inherited differences in the potential of the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. Moreover, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have been considered the phase II enzymes that contribute to detoxifying various toxic and potentially carcinogenic compositions (Hayes and Pulford, 1995). Researchers recognized 5 classes of GST enzymes in human (GST classes α, μ, π, σ, and θ). A separate gene or gene family encodes each of the classes. Then, the allelic variants for each gene can cause less efficient or absent enzymatic detoxification, thereby increasing susceptibility to cancer; however, we have no accurate knowledge of the biochemical procedures. One of the most common members of GSTs is the GSTP1 which has a well-known genetic variation entitled rs1695 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). This gene is located on chromosome 11 (11q13) and the mentioned SNP causes an amino acid substitution has been described at codon 105 (A313G→Ile105Val), resulting in the production of a functionally changed enzyme (Vogl et al., 2004; Udomsinprasert et al., 2005). Another common genetic variation for GSTP1 is the rs1138272 which results in Ala to Val substitution at codon 114 (Val114Ala). The GST class π gene encodes the GSTP1 enzyme is chiefly observed in the heart, spleen, and lung tissues. The GST class π enzyme is also expressed in breast cancer tissue (Kelley et al., 1994).<SEP>Most investigations found a relationship between breast cancer and GSTP1 common polymorphisms (Liu et al., 2013; Khabaz, 2014; Jaramillo-Rangel et al., 2015; Kimi et al., 2016; Song et al., 2016). Nonetheless, these investigations did not lead to a firm conclusion. On the other hand, there are no sufficient studies investigating the association of these single nucleotide polymorphisms with breast cancer risk. Hence, this case-control study has been done to provide a relatively reliable result which is followed by a bioinformatics approach.","Materials and Methods<SEP> Case-control study <SEP> Subjects <SEP>An attempt was made to design the project and the paper according to the rules of the STREGA (Table S1). In this case-control study, based on the number of available samples, 100 women with the mean age of 44.26±6.80 years with only sporadic breast cancer and 100 healthy women with the mean age of 45.48±6.08 years were enrolled. We chose the controls and cases from the women referring to the Pasteur pathobiology and genetics laboratory and also Rohani hospital (Babol, Iran). Diagnosing breast cancer has been proved by histological examinations for case participants. Moreover, the controls have been chosen from healthy women referring to the same hospital for routine examinations. Notably, each control participant lacked a history of oncological diseases. In addition, 3 mL of blood has been obtained from each subject. Besides, the present research has been performed according to the principles proposed in the Declaration of Helsinki.<SEP> GSTP1 polymorphisms genotyping <SEP>In this study, we evaluated two common SNPs in GSTP1 gene. According to the research design, a commercial Kit (CinnaGen, Tehran, Iran) has been used to extract genomic DNA from the blood samples. Then, the PCR strategy has been used to amplify the GSTP1 fragment containing rs1695 and rs1138272 polymorphisms. Moreover, PCR has been amplified in a final volume of 30 μl. Its mixture consisted of 1×PCR buffer, 50 ng of template DNA, 0.5 μL dNTPs mix, 2.5 μM MgCl2, and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase, and 0.35 μM each of forward and reverse primers (F: 5’-CTCTCATCCTTCCACGCACATCC-3’ and R: 5’-CTGCACCCTGACCCAAGAAGGG-3’ for rs1695 and F: 5’-ACAGGATTTGGTACTAGCCT-3’ and R: 5’-AGTGCCTTCACATAGTCATCCTTG-3’ for rs1138272). All PCR reagents were ordered from CinnaGen Company (Tehran, Iran). PCR procedure was done in an Eppendorf thermal cycler (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). Notably, PCR amplification started with an early denaturation at 94°C for five minutes and then 33 cycles with 94°C (45 sec), 60°C (45 sec) and 72°C (45 sec) have proceeded. In addition, the final extension has been done at 72°C for 10 min, and thus the cycle ended to maintain at 4°C. The PCR products were treated with BsmAI restriction enzyme (Fermentas, Germany) for rs1695 and AciI (Fermentas, Germany) for rs1138272 according to manufacturer’s instruction. Finally, the PCR-RFLP products have been electrophoresed on 1.5 % agarose stained with Green Viewer™. UV transillumination has been used to visualize the amplicon bands. For rs1695 SNP, the samples with one band (363-bp) on 2.0% agarose gel had genotype AA while the samples with two bands (226- and 137-bp) on agarose gel had genotype GG. Therefore, the sample containing three mentioned fragments (363-, 226- and 137-bp) were considered as heterozygote genotype AG. Regarding rs1138272 polymorphism, the fragment with allele C was digested to two fragments (143- and 27-bp) and allele T has no restriction site for the enzyme (170-bp) that was detected on 3.0% agarose gel.<SEP> Statistical analyses <SEP>According to the research design, the Chi-squared test has been applied for evaluating the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Moreover, a p-value less of than 0.05 has been considered as a significant deviation from the HWE. Then, in the present case-control study, we computed OR with 95% CI for all genotypes and alleles in the cases and controls. Additionally, a chi-square test has been used to evaluate the differences between cases and controls (Rafatmanesh et al., 2018; Talebi et al., 2018). Then, a two-tailed p-value<0.05 has been regarded as statistically significant. The SPSS 20 (SPSS Inc., IBM Corp Armonk, NY, USA) has been used to run the statistical analysis.<SEP> In silico analysis <SEP>In this study, we evaluated the molecular effects of rs1695 polymorphism on the GSTP1 structure by the SNPeffects web server. For this purpose, at first, the entire sequence of the GSTP1 gene was obtained from NCBI. Then the coding sequence of the gene was deduced and then was translated to amino acid sequence by ExPASy bioinformatics webserver. The location of the rs1695 variation was determined on codon 105 (Ile105Val). This sequence was introduced to SNPeffects online web server and then the influence of rs1695 SNP on aggregation propensity (TANGO), amyloid propensity (WALTZ) and chaperone binding (LIMBO) was evaluated (De Baets et al., 2011).","Results<SEP> Genetic association outcomes <SEP>For, rs1695 polymorphism, our data from genotypes distribution showed no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in our study for both case and control groups. The distribution of alleles and genotypes of rs1695 polymorphism are summarized in Table 1. After analysis, we found that the frequency of genotypes AA, AG, and GG for controls is 50.00%, 44.00%, and 06.00%, respectively. While these ratios were calculated 37.00%, 49.00%, and 14.00%, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed that the homozygote genotype GG is associated with increased risk of breast cancer (OR= 3.1532, 95%CI= 1.1072 to 8.9798, p= 0.0315) but AG genotype was not associated with the risk of breast cancer (OR= 1.5049, 95%CI= 0.8354 to 2.7109, p= 0.1734). Although carriers of allele G had high frequency in the patient population, this difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, allele analysis revealed that the allele G is associated with the increased risk of breast cancer (OR= 1.6098, 95%CI= 1.0577 to 2.4500, p= 0.0263).<SEP>For, rs1138272 polymorphism, our data from genotypes distribution showed no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for both case and control groups. The distribution of alleles and genotypes of rs1138272 polymorphism are summarized in Table 2. After analysis, we found that the frequency of genotypes CC, CT, and TT for controls is 92.00%, 08.00%, and 00.00%, respectively. While these ratios for cases were calculated 88.00%, 11.00%, and 01.00%, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed that the homozygote TT (OR= 3.1356, 95%CI= 0.1260 to 78.0014, p= 0.4858) and heterozygote CT (OR= 1.4375, 95%CI= 0.5524 to 3.7411, p= 0.4571) genotype are not associated with risk of breast cancer. Also, the carriers of allele T had no high frequency in the patient population compared to controls. Moreover, allele analysis revealed that the allele T is not associated with the risk of breast cancer (OR= 1.6684, 95%CI= 0.6760 to 4.1180, p= 0.2668).<SEP> In silico analysis  <SEP>We evaluated the effects of Ile105Val single nucleotide polymorphism on the GSTP1 function by SNPeffects online software. Our data revealed that based on the TANGO model, the Ile105Val SNP does not influence the aggregation tendency of our studied protein as well as LIMBO analysis, the mentioned SNP does not affect the chaperone binding tendency of GSTP1 protein. But, based on WALTZ output, we found that the Ile105Val polymorphism decreases the amyloid propensity of the GSTP1 enzyme. WALTZ algorithm specifically and accurately predicts amyloid-forming areas in the sequences of protein. The overall WALTZ value for CSTP1 estimated 906.54 and mutations/variations could elevate (dWALTZ >50), reduce (dWALTZ <-50) or not influence amyloid propensity (dWALTZ between -50 and 50). In our analysis, dWALTZ was calculated -228.00 which means that the polymorphism reduces the amyloid propensity of the GSTP1. In Figures 1 and 2, the location of the WALTZ stretches in the normal type and mutant enzyme are shown, demonstrate by correspondingly a bar or profile illustration. The short stretches are recorded for both mutant and wild type (Table 3). To compare the influence of the SNP to the wild type, we also display a Difference outline (Figure 3), that plans the difference between wild and mutant protein.","Discussion<SEP>It has been found that allelic variability at a single locus could not explain the etiology of a majority of the common cancers. Besides, a main load of cancer in the general population likely is the result of the complicated interaction of several environmental and genetic parameters during the time. However, perception of the interactions of endogenous physiology, xenobiotic exposure, and genetic variability at numerous loci would provide information about the cancer etiology and detect people at the greater risks of progressing cancer. In this study, we evaluated the association of two common genetic variations (Ile105Val and Val114Ala) in the GSTP1 with breast cancer risk. This enzyme is a member of enzymes family that has an essential role in detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of various electrophilic and hydrophobic compounds with reduced glutathione. Our data revealed that Ile105Val variation as an exonic SNP could alter the risk of breast cancer. In detail, the genotype homozygote GG is associated with the risk of breast cancer. Also, allele analysis revealed a true association of allele G and breast cancer susceptibility. However, we did not find any significant association between rs1138272 polymorphism and breast cancer risk. Some studies were investigating the association of the GSTP1 polymorphisms with breast cancer risk. For example, Samson et al., (2007) reported a non-significant elevation in the risk of breast cancer was observed among women who had the GSTP1 Val/Val genotype (Samson et al., 2007). While, Ge et al., (2013) reported a positive association between GSTP1-Ile105Val polymorphism and breast cancer risk (Ge et al., 2013). The dissimilar results from different studies may be due to environmental, geographic, race, and other factors.<SEP>Notably, the conjugation or addition of the aliphatic-aromatic heterocyclic radicals, epoxide, or arene oxide to glutathione is catalyzed by the mentioned enzymes (Kemper et al., 2014). Moreover, the conjugation reaction at the electrophilic center of such compositions happens at the sulfur atom of the glutathione molecule (Rebbeck, 1997). Therefore, the molecules function as the glutathione peroxidase; however, they did not need a selenium co-factor for performing the conjugation reaction (Rebbeck, 1997). Also, GSTP1 is a gene that is related to DNA repair, and keeps DNA from an impairment, controls detoxification and metabolism, so preventing tumor incidence. The GSTP1 gene methylation often shows tumors progression, including breast cancer or unfavorable prognosis (Schnekenburger et al., 2014). Consistent with the role of methylation of GSTP1 in the tumor’s progression, a study showed significantly increased gene methylation of GSTP1 in breast cancer cells, which was positively associated with tumor size and TNM stage, and negatively associated with the expression of ER/PR (Schnekenburger et al., 2014). This evidence could elucidate the main role of disrupted GSTP1 in breast susceptibility. This could explain the role of key single nucleotide polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of GSTP1. Genetic variations based on their positions in a gene could alter the gene function (Salimi et al., 2017; Nejati et al., 2018). The SNPs on the promoter of a gene may alter the gene expression however the SNPs in the intron regions could alter the production of mature mRNA by interfering with the splicing process (Mobasseri et al., 2019; Zamani-Badi et al., 2019). But, the missense mutations could alter the structure and function of proteins (Noureddini et al., 2018; Bafrani et al., 2019) what may be true for GSTP1-Ile105Val genetic variation. Evaluation of the impacts of genetic variations by biological experiments is a very difficult process and evaluation of these impacts could be much easier with the in silico tools (Tameh et al., 2018; Zamani-Badi et al., 2018). In this study, also we employed the SNPeffects bioinformatics tool to evaluate the molecular effects of Ile105Val SNP on the GSTP1 gene and we found that this polymorphism decreases the amyloid propensity of GSTP1 protein and therefore, the pathogenic effect of Ile105Val may arise from this issue.<SEP>In addition to GSTP1, recently, some reviews (Armstrong, 1991; Guengerich et al., 1992; Daniel, 1993) illustrated the protein structure, inducibility, enzymology, and level of expression (e.g., gender- and tissue-specific expression) of GSTTl and GSTM1. They provided a summary of GSTTl or GSTM1 contribution to the metabolisms of and induction by multiple popular or uncertain carcinogenic compounds. The compounds are benzo-(a)pyrene, styrene-7,8-oxide, and trans-stilbene oxide by GSTM1 and epoxybutanes, halomethanes, ethylene oxide, and methyl bromide by GSTT1. According to the above list, we do not observe a single class of chemical compositions, which has been related to the GSTM1 or GSTT induction or metabolism (Hayes and Pulford, 1995). Finally, it has been found that GSTTl and GSTM1 contribute to the metabolisms of multiple xenobiotics like the chemotherapeutic factors, environmental carcinogens, and reactive oxygen samples (Tew et al., 1993). Besides, it seems that GSTM1 distinctly involves the susceptibility to cancer including breast cancer due to its possible distinctive substrate qualities.<SEP>Our study showed that GSTP1-Ile105Val polymorphism could be a genetic risk factor for breast cancer. Based on this theory, the mentioned polymorphism could be considered as a biomarker for screening of susceptible women. However, there are some limitations in our study which should be mentioned. At first, we did not evaluate the influence of gene-gene and gene-environmental factors. Also, the small sample size of our study could be considered as the second limitation of our study. Therefore, evaluation of this polymorphism in larger sample size with regard to the aforementioned interactions could result in more accurate outcomes.",16775,['VITMIN']
33668890,"1. Introduction<SEP>Wilson’s disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by abnormal copper metabolism resulting in the damage of various organs, predominantly hepatic and neurological impairment. The diagnosis of the disease can be based on the typical clinical symptoms and corresponding biochemical findings such as reduced serum ceruloplasmin concentrations and elevated urinary copper excretion. It has a prevalence rate of around 1/30,000 to 1/10,000 as well as a carrier frequency of about 1 in 90 among most populations, and it is believed that the prevalence is higher in China.<SEP>In 1993, the ATP7B gene accounting for the disease was identified. At the same time, several highly polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs) spanning the WD locus were found. These microsatellite markers were previously applied in the genetic linkage analysis of Chinese WD patients, which showed great contribution to the molecular diagnosis of potential carriers and asymptomatic patients. In addition, Thomas et al. used the markers to explore the haplotype-variant associations, which were beneficial for explaining the origins of different variants. In this way, with recurrent pathogenic variants gradually identified in European populations, some scholars speculated about the origin from a common ancestor and then unveiled the possible founder effect for them. For instance, one study comprised of Hungarian patients discovered the common haplotype for their most frequent variant p.H1069Q in a large proportion of subjects, pointing its origin from somewhere in eastern Europe.<SEP>Investigations of founder variants can help us trace the origins of variants, the evolution of the disease as well as the migration and growth of human populations, and there indeed exist different circumstances about common variants and population cultures of WD between Europe and Asia. Studies have previously summarized the geographical distribution of ATP7B in diverse populations in the world and found the higher prevalence of specific variants in certain populations, such as p.H1069Q in Europe and p.R778L in far east Asian countries. Therefore, several haplotype studies in Asia were also performed to dig out the characteristics of their own common variants. In India, researchers recently considered the impact of traditional marriages in the same caste, and then detected the underlying founder effect for 14 WD recurrent variants including p.C271* and p.G711W. Studies in other regions including Japan, China and Korea also conducted the haplotype analysis of ATP7B variants before, however, due to their target towards the whole variant spectrum, the number of their samples concerning frequent pathogenic variants such as p.R778L seemed inadequate, making the conclusion not so convincing. Meanwhile, there remained frequent differences among the variants and haplotype results of their studies.<SEP>Therefore, aiming to better decipher the genetic information about the potential founder effect of prevalent ATP7B variants, we utilized the p.R778L, p.P992L and p.T935M, the three most common pathogenic variants in the Chinese WD patients, to acquire their geographical distribution and analyze the haplotype-variant correlation with relatively large samples in a statistical way.","2. Materials and Methods<SEP>2.1. Subjects<SEP>To analyze the geographical distribution of three prevalent pathogenic variants, we recruited 715 WD patients reported in our previous study. Then, 102 unrelated WD families were recruited for the current haplotype study. These families consisted of patients who had been identified with one or two of the three common variants by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and their unaffected relatives. They were enrolled between June, 2015, and October, 2020, in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. All subjects originated from Chinese mainland. WD patients were clinically diagnosed according to the Leipzig Score. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Participants or their guardians provided informed consents.<SEP>2.2. Genotype Analysis<SEP>Genomic DNA was extracted using Blood Genomic Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from peripheral EDTA-treated blood. The ATP7B variants of patients and their relatives were verified through Sanger sequencing, with a procedure described in our previous report. For patients who were detected with only one heterozygous pathogenic variant, we performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MLPA) with the ATP7B MLPA kit (SALSA P098-D1, MRC-Holland, the Netherlands).<SEP>2.3. Haplotype Analysis<SEP>To derive the haplotype on each WD or normal chromosome, we used three microsatellite markers (D13S314, D13S301, D13S316) flanking the WD locus, which had previously been used for linkage analysis. Specific primers for the amplification of these markers were described in previous studies, and one of each pair was labeled with fluorescent dye. The PCR was carried out in 10 μL total volume containing 50 ng genomic DNA, 1 mM of each primer and 7 μL KAPA 2G Robust Mix (KAPA Biosystems, Boston, MA, USA). The thermal condition was adjusted according to the previous study. The PCR products were then quantified with deionized water. The mix including 4.2 μL Genescan 550HD size standard (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with highly deionized formamide and 0.8 μL diluted PCR products was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and chilled quickly to 4 °C. All the samples underwent the electrophoresis on the ABI Prism 3730 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and the data were handled using the GeneMarke software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The size measurement was repeated three times independently for each sample.<SEP>2.4. Statistical Analysis<SEP>The geographical and allele distribution as well as haplotype association of three prevalent pathogenic variants were analyzed by chi-square test, with a Bonferroni correction or Fisher’s exact test when appropriate. WD chromosomes with the three variants were compared with normal chromosomes from the probands’ unaffected family members, as the controls. The analysis was performed in SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). p value < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.","3. Results<SEP>3.1. Geographical Distribution of Three Prevalent Pathogenic Variants<SEP>Among 715 unrelated WD patients, p.R778L, p.P992L and p.T935M were the three most prevalent pathogenic variants. Their allelic frequency was 31.7, 15.7 and 6.6%, respectively, which was close to what we reported previously. Among 709 patients with geographical information, as shown in Figure 1a, the majority (579, 81.7%) were from southeastern China. Five regions accounted for the main proportion, in the order of Fujian province (261, 36.8%), Zhejiang (168, 23.7%), Jiangsu (71, 10.0%), Shanghai (56, 7.9%) and Jiangxi (43, 6.1%). Then, we compared the allelic frequency of three prevalent variants in these regions. There was no obvious difference in the allelic frequency of p.R778L among these regions (Figure 1b). For p.P992L, though its allelic frequency in Jiangxi (19/86, 22.1%) was significantly higher than that of Zhejiang (33/336, 9.8%) (p < 0.01), no other difference among the regions was seen (Figure 1c). However, as shown in Figure 1d, we found that the allelic frequency of p.T935M in Fujian (71/522, 13.6%) was significantly higher than that of Zhejiang (15/336, 4.5%), Jiangsu (1/142, 0.7%), Shanghai (0/112, 0.0%) or Jiangxi (2/86, 2.3%) (p < 0.01), impressively indicating the tendency for aggregation.<SEP>3.2. Linkage Disequilibrium at Three Markers for Three Prevalent Pathogenic Variants<SEP>Among 102 WD patients with the three prevalent pathogenic variants, biallelic variants were identified in each of them and successfully segregated in the corresponding relatives. There were 74 patients with c.2333G > T (p.R778L), 27 with c.2975C > T (p.P992L) and 13 with c.2804C > T (p.T935M). Among them, 26 patients were with homozygous p.R778L, two with homozygous p.P992L, one with homozygous p.T935M, eight with p.R778L and p.P992L, and four with p.R778L and p.T935M. The rest were all compound heterozygotes with one of the three prevalent variants and other variants. <SEP>To clarify the association of each specific marker with the variants, we firstly observed the allele distribution of p.R778L, p.P992L and p.T935M at each marker. The allele size definition for the three microsatellite markers (D13S314, D13S301, D13S316) used was based on a previous study. In total, there were 100 chromosomes with p.R778L, 29 with p.P992L, 14 with p.T935M and 177 normal chromosomes in this study. As shown in Figure 2a, D13S314 exhibited significant linkage disequilibrium at allele 10 for chromosomes with p.R778L (98.0%) and p.P992L (82.8%) vs. control ones (26.0%, p < 0.01), while entirely linked at allele 12 for p.T935M (100 vs. 37.3%, p < 0.01). In terms of D13S301, we found the significant association of p.R778L with both allele 7 (65.0 vs. 36.7%, p < 0.01) and allele 8 (33.0 vs. 9.6%, p < 0.01), p.P992L with allele 9 (79.3 vs. 6.2%, p < 0.01) and p.T935M with allele 4 (78.6 vs. 20.3%, p < 0.01), respectively (Figure 2b). As shown in Figure 2c, D13S316 exhibited significant linkage distribution at allele 7 for p.R778L (89.0 vs. 7.9%, p < 0.01), allele 5 for p.P992L (86.2 vs. 43.5%, p < 0.01) and allele 8 for p.T935M (100.0 vs. 39.0%, p < 0.01). These results revealed that all three prevalent pathogenic variants had great linkage disequilibrium at each microsatellite marker, which might contribute to the haplotype association.<SEP>3.3. Haplotype Association of Three Prevalent Pathogenic Variants<SEP>With the alleles acquired at three microsatellite markers, we constructed the haplotypes for three prevalent pathogenic variants in 102 patients and found haplotype–variant correlations (Table 1). In light of the possibility that the new allele could be obtained through slippage during DNA replication from generation to generation, haplotypes differing by no more than one repeat unit at a single marker were gathered to one group.<SEP>The most prevalent pathogenic variant in China, p.R778L, was found to associate with three haplogroups (A, B, C). Haplogroup A was overwhelmingly common on WD chromosomes (97/100, 97.0%) vs. control ones (17/177, 9.6%, p < 0.01). It could be subsequently subdivided into haplotype variants A1–A4 (10-7-7; 10-7-8; 10-8-7; 10-8-8) and variant A1 (10-7-7) accounted for the largest proportion (57.0%). Haplogroup B (10-7-9) and C (12-5-7; 12-6-7) were found to be relatively scarce (1.0 and 2.0%, respectively) when compared with haplogroup A, suggesting that haplogroup A could exactly represent almost all the genetic information of p.R778L. <SEP>However, the haplotype spectrum of p.P992L was more complex, including six haplogroups (D, E, F, G, H, I). Among them, haplogroup E was more common on WD chromosomes (21/29, 72.4%) than control ones (6/177, 3.4%, p < 0.01). It contained two variants (E1, E2), among which variant E1 (10-9-5) occupied the main part (69.0%) and variant E2 (10-9-6) was only found on one WD chromosome (3.4%). Haplogroup D (9-7-5), F (10-9-8), G (10-11-5), H (12-4-5; 12-5-5) and I (12-5-8) appeared sporadically, accounting for 3.4, 6.9, 3.4, 10.3 and 3.4% on WD chromosomes, respectively. Contrary to p.P992L, p.T935M presented a uniform state. There was only one kind of haplogroup on WD chromosomes, haplogroup J, which consisted of two variants J1 (12-4-8) and J2 (12-5-8), showing great significance vs. control ones (100 vs. 15.3%, p < 0.01). Additionally, variant J1 (12-4-8) was more common (78.6%).","4. Discussion<SEP>The origin of prevalent ATP7B pathogenic variants in Chinese WD population remains to be elucidated. Consequently, in this study, we first depicted the geographical distribution characteristics of three common variants (p.R778L, p.P992L, p.T935M) using a large WD cohort and then provided the haplotype spectrum of the three variants with a maximum sample size to date.<SEP>According to previous studies, the prevalent ATP7B pathogenic variants can vary by different populations in the world, and even show genetic heterogeneity in one certain country such as India, due to its ethnic diversity. There also exist different constitutions of variants in the Chinese population of various districts. Though p.R778L was always detected as the most common pathogenic variant, the second common pathogenic variant was discovered to be p.A874V in one study of northern Chinese population and p.I1148T primarily in the Guangdong province, Southern China, rather than p.P992L. All of these imply that ATP7B variants can have the characteristic of regional-specific distribution. As we discovered in this study, p.T935M was significantly associated with Fujian province, hinting at the possibility of a founder effect, while both p.R778L and p.P992L were not found to show such a specific tendency. These findings about the regional distribution of variants can help develop time-saving approaches and accelerate the genetic diagnosis of WD in specific regions, considering the vast diversity of the ATP7B variant spectrum.<SEP>We then observed in the haplotype spectrum that both p.R778L and p.T935M mainly had one haplogroup constituted by D13S314, D13S301 and D13S316, which could be represented by 10-7-7 and 12-4-8, respectively. Although there indeed existed some variants in the haplogroup, it could be noticed that there were only slight variations (no more than one repeat unit at a single locus), which could be explained by the allele slippage event. This indicates the obvious founder effect of these two variants, especially p.T935M, which showed total single haplogroup and concentrated geographic distribution. For p.P992L, there were more kinds of haplogroups and their distribution seemed scattered, as haplogroups differed by more than one repeat unit at a single marker, even with the size interval over 10 bp. Despite this, we still found that haplogroup D, particularly variant D1, 10-9-5, accounted for the majority in the series. Therefore, such variations might not indicate independent origins of the same variant, but emerge as a result of multiple allele slippages or recombination events with other haplogroups on an old common ancestor during a very long period.<SEP>To compare our studies with others, in Table 2, we summarized the results involving the three prevalent variants in other areas including Japan, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, China. Both Japan and Taiwan, China, had two related studies, and we chose one with more samples, respectively. Consistent with our study, it was also rare that there was only one pure haplotype for each variant in those regions. Meanwhile, the haplotypes of three variants all showed discrepancies to an extent in comparison with their studies. Firstly, it was noticeable that the most apparent difference between Japanese and Chinese population lay in the marker D13S314. For Taiwan, China, when comparing the most common haplotype of p.R778L and p.P992L, we found that the allele at each marker in our study exceeded that of theirs by nearly 2–3 units. Furthermore, the data of the study from Hong Kong, China, could be the closest with ours, though there still remained variations, mainly in the marker D13S301. Apart from them, Korean scholars also studied the haplotype feature of p.R778L before, though the same marker they utilized was D13S316 alone and they used a different allele size definition. We also noticed the similar phenomenon that their main allele size for p.R778L at this marker was 164, which showed great distance from our result 142. The reasons accounting for the multiplicity among the studies could include the lack of consensus on allele size definition, different amplification primer sequences or approaches to the marker size measurement used and importantly, the heterogeneity which originally existed among different regions.<SEP>Unlike the diversity of haplotype pattern among Asian regions, it is noteworthy that the most prevalent ATP7B pathogenic variant for Europe, p.H1069Q, was found with the same haplotype in an overwhelming proportion of subjects from various European countries including Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This may indicate different circumstances about the migration and growth of human populations between the two continents, which could be explained by relevant history.<SEP>Actually, the other studies for the three variants all reflected certain tendencies of founder effect, however, the number of WD chromosomes carrying each variant might not be so adequate, which should constitute the strength of our study. On the other hand, our study also has some limitations. For instance, the method of capillary electrophoresis may induce tiny deviations in some families, which sometimes cannot uncover the most precise size of the marker. In addition, first-degree siblings of probands were not recruited in this study to strengthen the evidence. Furthermore, to better understand the founder effect in WD, other frequent pathogenic variants in China might also need further distinct investigation.",17372,['VITMIN']
24018621,"Introduction<SEP>Warfarin is the most widely used anticoagulant with over 33 million prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. during 2011. Although new oral anticoagulant drugs, such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban, were expected to supplant warfarin, their use remains limited by cost, narrow indications, non-reversibility, gastrointestinal side effects, difficulty in monitoring anticoagulation, and concerns about serious bleeding. Unfortunately, warfarin ranks among the top ten drug-related causes of serious adverse effects ranging from occult bleeding to death. While several polymorphisms have been found to be associated, the most well studied genetic variants are CPY2C9*2 (rs1799853), CYPC9*3 (rs1057910), and VKORC1 -1639 (rs9923231). These genetic variants have been used by many groups, with the largest effort to date by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC), to develop pharmacogenomics-guided warfarin dosing algorithms which also include non-genetic factors in order to predict stable warfarin maintenance dose. The two, publicly available, algorithms to predict dose response - the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm and the IWPC clinical algorithm have been investigated for the predictive power in a large cohort. However, the representation of African Americans (AAs) in this effort was low (<10% of the study population). Most pharmacogenomics algorithms (developed in largely Caucasian populations) have been predominantly associated with warfarin sensitivity and consequently are more useful in identifying subgroups of patients who require low doses of warfarin. Furthermore, the minor allele frequencies of rs1799853, rs1057910, and rs9923231 variants are much lower among AAs compared to Caucasians. This may explain why these algorithms have shown more promise in Caucasian and Asian populations, predicting approximately 55% of the variability in warfarin dose, given these two groups require lower doses of warfarin than populations of African descent. In fact, their ability to predict warfarin dose variability in AAs has been much lower, at approximately 20%. Populations of recent African descent have a great amount of genetic diversity, much of which is specific to this population. Consequently, SNPs identified in Caucasian populations may not completely capture the genetic variation contributing to a phenotype in AAs.<SEP>Previously, we described two novel variants in VKORC1 (rs61162043) and in CYP2C9 (rs7089580) found through targeted resequencing efforts in AAs that were significantly associated with warfarin dose requirement independent of known genetic variants (rs9923231, rs1799853, rs1057910, rs28371686, rs7900194, and rs28371685). More importantly, rs61162043 and rs7089580 were predictive of higher warfarin dose requirement in both the discovery and validation cohorts of African American (AA) patients on stable warfarin dose. Through a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) in collaboration with the IWPC, we identified rs12777823, located upstream of CYP2C18, to be associated with lower warfarin dose requirement in AAs independent of rs1799853, rs1057910, and rs992323. In addition, no significant association was found in European and Japanese GWAS datasets.<SEP>We first developed a novel pharmacogenomics warfarin dosing algorithm which incorporates these novel variants along with population-specific clinical variables in a derivation cohort of 349 individuals (previously described). In this study, we determined whether our novel AA algorithm was significantly better at predicting the maintenance dose of warfarin than the IWPC’s pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms in an additional independent validation cohort of 149 AAs. Because of substantial variation of admixture rates among AAs, we also examined the association between percent West African ancestry (WAA) and warfarin dose prediction.","Materials and Methods<SEP>The study design included retrospective data from the derivation cohort (N = 349) to generate our novel AA algorithm that was then tested in the validation cohort (N = 149). <SEP>Validation cohort<SEP>A total of 149 warfarin patients were recruited from anticoagulation clinics at the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, The George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates and the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Washington, DC. This validation cohort was independent of the derivation cohort from which the algorithm was generated. Inclusion criteria were patients self-described as AA, age≥18 years, and treatment with a stable dose of warfarin, defined as the same dose for at least three consecutive clinic visits that produced an international normalized ratio (INR) within the therapeutic range. INR measurements for patients were made on a ProtTime Microcoagulation System (ITC, Edison, NJ) or on Diagnostica Stago analyzers (STA-R Evolution and STA-Compact, Diagnostica Stago, Parsippany, NJ). One 10-ml blood sample was taken from each subject by venipuncture and placed in purple-top Vacutainer tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and frozen at −20 °C for DNA extraction. All protocols were approved by the institutional review boards from each participating institution. All patients provided written informed consent.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples using the Puregene (Gentra Biosystems) DNA isolation kit. Patients were genotyped for rs1799853, rs1057910, rs28371686, rs7900194, rs28371685, rs9923231, rs61162043, rs7089580, and rs12777823 using previously published methods. A panel of 105 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) was genotyped for each patient to determine WAA. Genotyping of AIMs was performed with the MassArray 7K HT genetic analysis system (Sequenom, Inc.) as previously described. SNPs out of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) at p < 0.001and a call rate <95% were excluded. Samples with SNP call rates <90% across all SNPs were excluded.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>Deviations from HWE were evaluated using the Fisher’s exact test in PLINK. Global individual ancestry was determined for each study participant using AIMs for European and WAA. Individual ancestry estimates were obtained from STRUCTURE 2.3.3 as previously described.<SEP>For each algorithm, the predicted dose of warfarin was correlated with the observed dose by the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Paired sample t-test was used to compare predicted mean dose for each algorithm with the observed dose. To evaluate the clinical accuracy of each algorithm, patients whose predicted dose fell within 20% of the actual stable therapeutic dose were divided into three dosing ranges according to the observed weekly dose: low dose (<40 mg/week), intermediate (40–50 mg/week), and high (>50 mg/week).<SEP>The predictive accuracy was assessed by calculating the percentage of patients correctly assigned to each dosing group for all algorithms. Accuracy of each algorithm was assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE). A two-tailed p-value was computed using McNemar’s test to determine if the difference between two models was significant. To estimate the number of patients needed to genotype (NNG) to prevent one adverse event, we used the methods previously described and as shown in Table 4. The NNG is the inverse of the absolute risk reduction, calculated as the absolute difference between the event rates for our novel AA algorithm and the IWPC clinical algorithm. Statistical analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics version 19.0.0 package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).<SEP>Algorithm generation<SEP>Our pharmacogenomics dosing model was generated using clinical and genotyping retrospective data from a derivation cohort of 349 AA patients and multivariate regression (MR) analysis. Weekly warfarin dose was log2-transformed prior to statistical modeling to achieve an approximately normal distribution and used as the dependent variable. The p- and β values are provided, reflecting the significance and the adjusted relative weight, respectively, of each variable included in the model (Table 1). The model equation used to predict weekly warfarin dose (mg) is:  <SEP>Age is given in years and weight in kg. Presence of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) and star variants is coded as 1 if present and 0 otherwise. Each of the SNPs (rs61162043 A/G, rs7089580 A/T, rs9923231 A/G, and rs12777823 A/G) are coded as 1 for each minor allele present (heterozygous = 1; homozygous for the minor allele = 2; and homozygous for the common allele = 0).","Results<SEP>Patients with incomplete clinical or genotypic data required to run any of the algorithms were excluded. This resulted in 129 patients remaining in the analysis. Demographic, clinical, and genetic variables for all study participants in the validation cohort are summarized on Table 2. The mean therapeutic warfarin dose was 46.9 mg/week (SD±17.2) and more than half of our patients (59.7%) were started on warfarin due to DVT/PE. We combined rs1799853, rs1057910, rs28371686, rs7900194, rs28371685,(CYP2C9*2, *3, *5, *8, and *11) into a CYP2C9 star variant group due to low frequency of the individual SNPs, each of which reduces CYP2C9 activity. None of the SNPs showed deviations from HWE at P<0.001. The minor allele frequencies for rs1799853, rs1057910, and rs9923231 were low (0.02, 0.02, and 0.06 respectively), consistent with previous studies.<SEP>We tested the accuracy of the three algorithms in our AA validation cohort by comparing the predicted dose requirements with the actual maintenance dose for each patient. Comparisons of our novel AA algorithm to the IWPC algorithms are shown in Table 3. The mean predicted dose utilizing our novel AA algorithm was much closer to the actual mean therapeutic dose (47.6 and 46.9 mg/week, respectively) and the difference between the mean predicted dose and mean therapeutic dose was not significant (p = 0.76). The predicted mean doses for the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms were found to be significantly lower (p = 0.004 and p = 3.3× 10−22, respectively) than the mean therapeutic dose (Table 3). Furthermore, the MAE with the novel AA algorithm (10.9 [SE ±0.92]) was lower than the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms (12.2 [SE ±0.98], and 17.9 [SE ±1.2] mg/week, respectively). We found the correlation between the observed and the predicted dose was strongest for the novel AA algorithm (r = 0.51) and the proportion of variability in warfarin dosage explained by the variables included in the algorithm was the highest (R2 = 0.27). The correlation between predicted and observed doses for both the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms were similar (0.38 and 0.41, respectively) as well as the proportion of variability explained (R2 = 0.15 and 0.16, respectively), consistent with the findings by the IWPC in their AA cohort (R2 = 0.19).<SEP>Both of the IWPC algorithms tended to under-predict warfarin doses while the novel AA algorithm over-predicted doses (Figure 1). However, approximately 38% of warfarin doses that were over-predicted by the novel AA algorithm were below 10mg/week (Figure 1A). While the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm over or under-predicted warfarin doses by up to 10mg/week in approximately 53% of patients (Figure 1B). The IWPC clinical algorithm under-predicted warfarin doses for the majority of patients (86.8%), with 33% being under estimated by 10–20 mg/week (Figure 1C). Our novel AA algorithm was able to predict the exact therapeutic dose in 10.9% of patients compared to 2.3% (p = 0.02) and none for the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms, respectively (Table 3 and Figure 1). Previous warfarin algorithms have used the target prediction range of within 20% of the observed dose to assess algorithm performance. We found that nearly 60% of predicted doses from our novel AA algorithm were within this 20% range compared to 48.8% and 26.4% for the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms, respectively (Table 3).<SEP>Most of the patients who are incorrectly dosed when using standard initiation doses require low or high warfarin doses, therefore it is important to analyze the performance of the algorithms in the extreme dose subgroups. Hence, we examined the predictive accuracy of the novel AA algorithm for patients requiring low (<40 mg/week), intermediate (40–50 mg/week), and high (>50 mg/week) dosing regimens (Figure 2). For patients requiring low doses, all three algorithms demonstrate similar predictive power. However, the MAE was lowest for the novel AA algorithm at 3.0 mg/week (SE ±0.48) compared to the IWPC pharmacogenomics (3.8 mg/week, SE ±0.58) and clinical algorithms (3.8 mg/week, SE ±0.45). Among patients in the intermediate dose group, the novel AA algorithm and the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm performed similarly with 82% and 84% of predicted doses within the 20% range respectively while the performance of the IWPC clinical algorithm begins to drop drastically with only 15.8% of warfarin doses predicted within the same range (Figure 2). For patients in the high dose group, the novel AA algorithm significantly out performs both of the IWPC algorithms (Figure 2). We found the novel AA algorithm was able to correctly detect the greatest percentage of high-dose patients (53%), whereas the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms correctly assigned 26% and 2%, respectively, of patients in this group. Overall, predicted doses derived from the novel AA algorithm were closer to the observed doses for more patients and the precision was higher as demonstrated by the consistently lower MAE. To determine the clinical benefit of incorporating our novel AA algorithm into practice versus using the IWPC clinical algorithm, we computed the NNG. In order to prevent one predicted dose from being outside of the 20% therapeutic dose range (event), it was estimated that approximately three patients would need to be genotyped (Table 4).<SEP>Self-reported race for AAs is not a strong proxy for genetic background and the availability of AIMs has made it possible to accurately measure admixture in AAs. Therefore, we examined how well our novel AA algorithm performs given the broad range of WAA among AAs. Overall among the doses predicted within a 20% range, mean percent WAA was not significantly different between the algorithms. For the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm, however, linear regression analysis revealed a strong inverse correlation between percent WAA and predicted dose within the 20% therapeutic dose range for patients requiring doses ≥60 mg/week (β = −2.04, p = 0.02) (Table 5). The correlation is also higher compared to our novel AA algorithm (r = 0.41 and r = 0.25, respectively). As expected, our novel AA algorithm did not show association because population-specific variables are incorporated and therefore may account for WAA.","Discussion<SEP>In this study, a novel warfarin dose prediction algorithm is presented and compared to IWPC’s clinical and pharmacogenomics algorithms for maintenance dose prediction in AAs. Our novel AA pharmacogenomics algorithm incorporates clinical and genetic information found to be specifically associated with warfarin dose in AAs resulting in a much higher percentage of predicted doses within 20% of the observed dose, decreased MAE in the predicted dose estimates, increased fraction of variability explained by these factors (R2), and a predictive power that is sensitive to within population diversity. The integration of novel SNPs associated with increased weekly warfarin dose in AAs also improves the accuracy of warfarin dose prediction in AA patients under high dose regimens. One critical clinical factor that is taken into account by our algorithm is the presence of DVT/PE, which AAs have the highest incidence and mortality rates in the U.S. These results suggest that incorporation of our AA novel algorithm into clinical practice may benefit AA patients by predicting the warfarin starting dose that best approximates the therapeutic dose and consequently decreasing the time needed to reach a stable INR and lowering the risk of non-response to therapy.<SEP>Our algorithm correctly predicted therapeutic dose in 58.9% of the cases versus 48.8% and 26.4% predicted by the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms, respectively and had the lowest MAE (10.9 mg/week) (Table 3). This significant improvement in dose prediction was more pronounced among patients whose stable therapeutic dose was >50 mg/week. This is clinically relevant as these patients are the most at risk for adverse consequences of warfarin initiation from under dosing and may demonstrate the greatest benefit from pharmacogenomics dosing. We found the NNG was 3.07 when comparing our novel AA algorithm to the IWPC clinical algorithm. Meaning, one misclassification is avoided for approximately every three patients whose dose is estimated using our novel AA algorithm when compared to the IWPC clinical algorithm. This estimate is much lower than the comparison of the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm to the IWPC clinical algorithm at 13.2. Recently, a clinical study has shown that genotype-guided warfarin dosing better predicted warfarin maintenance dose and reduced out-of-range INRs compared to standard dosing. However, clinical implementation of pharmacogenomic algorithms is, in part, hindered by the time and the cost required to obtain genotypes utilizing traditional methods. This may be overcome through progress in genotyping technologies such as rapid-melting curve analysis which can provide results within one hour. With the drop in cost of genotying, we for see the development of population-specific panels of variants to become feasible. A model system designed to overcome many of the barriers associated with the translation of pharmacogenomics into clinical practice (The 1200 Patient Project) was recently implemented where the use of preemptive genotyping for a large number of variants reduces cost (<$500/patient) and an interactive informatics portal aims to improve interpretation of results into clinical action .<SEP>A study evaluated the performance of nine algorithms, including the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm, by race and found the MAE to be the highest in the AA population compared to Caucasians and Asians. They found the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm to perform better for AAs. They obtained similar results for their AA cohort as we did for our cohort when utilizing the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm (MAE = 12.0 mg/week, within 20% = 46.4%; MAE = 12.2 mg/week, within 20% = 48.8%, respectively). Recently, Ramirez et al proposed an “expanded genetic algorithm” which included CYP4F2 and CALU variants not utilized in our novel algorithm that predicted warfarin dose better in AAs and EAs compared to IWPC’s. However, this expanded algorithm only predicted correctly the low dose for AAs in three out of 12 cases compared to our novel AA algorithm where 21 individuals out of 46 were correctly assigned (Figure 2). As for the high dose group, their expanded algorithm performed similarly to IWPC’s algorithm, whereas our novel algorithm correctly detected 27% and 51% more individuals requiring high doses compared to the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms respectively.<SEP>There are limitations in our study, such as the exclusion of other genetic variants and clinical factors that have been shown to be associated with warfarin dose requirements. One study found rs339097 in CALU to be associated with high warfarin doses in AAs, however in our derivation cohort we did not observed this association and consequently the SNP was excluded from our algorithm. SNPs rs7089580 and rs12777823 were not statistically significant in our initial MR analysis, but were included due to their significant association in our univariate analysis and previous strong association to warfarin dose requirement in AAs in larger population cohorts. In the univariate analysis on the derivation cohort, rs1799853 was marginally significant (p = 0.047) and rs1057910 was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). The mean warfarin dose is considered high which may lead to a bias in algorithm performance. However, the mean warfarin dose in our cohort is similar to that in other published studies among AAs and therefore represents typical doses in this population. In fact, AA ethnicity has been found to be a predictor of warfarin doses ≥5 mg/day. Although, we have not assessed our novel algorithm’s performance in other ethnicities, the incorporation of SNPs rs61162043, rs7089580, and rs12777823 which are associated with warfarin dose response among AAs as well as clinical factors found to be more prevalent among AAs (DVT/PE, higher dose requirement) can potentially hinder its performance in other ethnic groups. Another limitation is our sample size for the validation cohort. Nonetheless, given the scarcity of AA pharmacogenomics samples, our study is still one of the largest in this population.<SEP>Because our novel AA algorithm incorporates several African specific CYP2C9 star alleles, we can better account for the effect of decreased enzyme activity on warfarin dose in this population. Therefore, our algorithm continues to perform as well as the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm in the prediction of low warfarin dose requirement - further demonstrating the need for population-specific algorithms. Studies have found that genetic ancestry proportions can vary significantly within individuals who self-identify as the same racial group and therefore we utilized percent WAA as an assessment tool in algorithm predictability. This is important considering that AAs have a broad range of ancestry; for example, it has been shown that only 34% of AAs possess >90% WAA as opposed to 98% of European Americans who have >90% European ancestry. For the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm, we observed an inverse correlation between percent WAA and performance among high dose patients (Table 5). The loss of predictability found in IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm suggests that non-population-specific algorithms lose predictability after certain genetic variance thresholds between populations are exceeded. The identification and incorporation of population-specific alleles into population-specific pharmacogenomics algorithms can simultaneously take into account genetic ancestry and help optimize warfarin doses. In addition, our findings strongly suggest that there may be other African-specific variants associated with warfarin dose requirement that have yet to be identified.<SEP>In conclusion, we have developed a novel pharmacogenomics dose algorithm that predicts the stable therapeutic dose of warfarin more effectively than either of the IWPC algorithms for AAs and the predictive power was not affected by the percentage of WAA in patients. We have incorporated SNPs previously associated with warfarin dose requirements in AAs that have not been used in any other pharmacogenomics algorithm. By focusing on population-specific clinical and genetic variables, were we able to more accurately predict warfarin dose in AAs, with the potential to address an important source of health disparities in this pharmacogenetically underserved group.<SEP>Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.",23443,['VITMIN']
26241700,"Introduction<SEP>The relationship between vitamin D metabolites and colorectal neoplasia has been studied extensively. In epidemiological research, the biomarker most commonly employed is 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D], which reflects both dietary intake and endogenous synthesis of vitamin D. Although some studies have shown no association between 25(OH)D and colorectal adenoma, meta-analyses have revealed significant inverse relationships between 25(OH)D and both colorectal adenoma and cancer. While 25(OH)D is the most abundant circulating metabolite of vitamin D, hydroxylation by the enzyme CYP27B1 is required for the formation of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D], which is the active, hormonal form of vitamin D. Although 1,25(OH)2D is not as frequently studied as 25(OH)D in epidemiological work, it has been demonstrated to have anti-carcinogenic effects in colon cells, and is the primary metabolite under investigation in experimental models of cancer. Further, our group and others have previously reported associations between concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D and colorectal adenoma. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the genetic factors that may alter the concentration of this hormone, and how they relate to odds of colorectal neoplasia.<SEP>As mentioned above, CYP27B1 is responsible for production of 1,25(OH)2D from the precursor molecule, 25(OH)D. In turn, the primary enzyme involved in 1,25(OH)2D catabolism is CYP24A1, which begins the process of metabolizing 1,25(OH)2D by hydroxylating the molecule at the C24 position to form 1,24,25(OH)3D. This molecule can no longer bind to or activate the vitamin D receptor, and in turn is further catabolized until it can be excreted. Our group has shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 have functional effects that ultimately alter the concentration of 1,25(OH)2D available in colon cancer cell lines such that a more active isotype of CYP27B1 and a less active form of CYP24A1 may have the net effect of increasing 1,25(OH)2D concentrations at the tissue level, and vice versa. We therefore sought to assess the effect of this variation in a human population.<SEP>The importance of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 in local intracrine modulation of 1,25(OH)2D is clear, and several epidemiological studies of genetic polymorphisms in CYP27B1 or CYP24A1 and either circulating concentrations of vitamin D metabolites or risk for colorectal cancer have been conducted. However, to date, there are no published studies of the association between variation in these genes and risk of the precursor lesions to colorectal cancer. Therefore, the goal of the current work was to conduct the first investigation of genetic variation in CYP27B1 or CYP24A1, circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D, and odds of colorectal adenoma recurrence.","Methods<SEP>Study population<SEP>Participants in the present study were drawn from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, the Wheat Bran Fiber (WBF) Trial and the Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA) Trial, which have been described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, the objective of the WBF trial was to compare the effect of a high-fiber vs. a low-fiber cereal supplement on adenoma recurrence among 1310 individuals from Phoenix, Arizona who had undergone colonoscopy and had one or more adenoma(s) removed. No differences in adenoma recurrence rates were observed between treatment groups. The UDCA trial employed a design similar to that of the WBF trial, and compared the effect of UDCA vs. placebo on adenoma recurrence among 1192 patients that had a prior polyp removed at colonoscopy. No main effect of UDCA on adenoma recurrence was observed. All participants who completed these clinical trials, had available serum for analysis of 25(OH)D, and had genotype data for CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 were eligible for the current study (n=1,188). A subset of these participants also had measured circulating concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D (n=828). The WBF and UDCA studies were approved by the University of Arizona Human Subjects Committee and local hospital committees, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to study enrollment.<SEP>Data collection<SEP>Self-administered baseline questionnaires were employed to capture dietary, sociodemographic, and medical history data for all participants in the WBF and UDCA trials. Dietary data were collected using the Arizona Food Frequency Questionnaire (AFFQ), which was developed based on the food frequency section of the National Cancer Institute’s Health Habits and History Questionnaire, and modified to reflect the diet in southwestern Arizona.<SEP>Information for adenoma characteristics such as number, size, location, and histology were collected for both baseline and recurrent adenomas. As described previously, data were obtained via medical records and pathology reports for each study participant. The study design for both the WBF and UDCA trials required all participants to have had at least one adenoma at baseline. After removal of these lesions, recurrent adenomas were defined as any colorectal adenoma detected at colonoscopy at least six months after randomization. Adenomas were classified as advanced if they had a diameter of 1 cm or more, and/or tubulovillous or villous histology (at least 25% villous). Among subjects who had more than one adenoma, the size and characterization of the histologic type were based on the largest and/or most advanced adenoma.<SEP>Selection of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 SNPs<SEP>The SNPs for the present study were selected a priori based on either prior reports of associations with colorectal cancer or circulating concentrations of vitamin D metabolites. In addition, SNPs that were investigated in our previously-published work, which revealed the functional effects of variants in the two genes, were considered for inclusion. Several SNPs in the latter group, particularly in CYP27B1, were excluded from the present analysis due to the high prevalence of monomorphs, most likely resulting from suspected pathogenic effects of the variation (rs28934604; rs58915677; rs2229103).<SEP>Genotyping was conducted though a service contract with BioServe Biotechnologies, Ltd [Beltsville, MD] using the MassARRAY iPLEX™ platform [Sequenom Laboratories, San Diego, CA], which employs a PCR process and mass spectrometry-based system, followed by a single-base extension reaction. A total of 24 DNA samples from the Coriell Polymorphism Discovery Panel were run in duplicate validate each plex group assay. PCR and extension primers were synthesized for the SNPs of interest at BioServe and checked using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer and Sequenom’s OligoCHECK software. Additional quality control checks, including duplicate control and negative control results were established, and a further quality control measure was conducted in 10% of the study samples, which were run in duplicate and compared. SNPs were considered to have failed the platform and dropped from the analysis if the assay yielded inaccurate or no control data based on published allele frequencies, or if call rates were < 80%. One SNP (rs3787557) was dropped from the present analysis for the latter reason.<SEP>Analysis of vitamin D metabolite levels<SEP>Measurement of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D concentrations was performed at Heartland Assays (Ames, IA). A competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay was employed for assessment of 25(OH)D concentrations, and included quality assurance and quality control measures such as a pooled serum sample analyzed with batches of study samples to monitor analytical precision and identify possible laboratory shifts over time, as well as testing duplicates in different batches. The coefficient of variation was less than 7.0% for 25(OH)D analyses. For 1,25(OH)2D concentrations, a 125I-based radioimmunoassay was employed, as has been described in detail previously. The coefficient of variation was 11.5% for 1,25(OH)2D analysis. All analyses were conducted in a blinded fashion. For assessment of statistical interactions between SNPs and concentrations and 25(OH)D, study participants were classified using Institute of Medicine criteria. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as circulating 25(OH)D concentrations <12 ng/ml; while inadequacy included those with 25(OH)D levels ≥ 12 and < 20 ng/ml. Participants with 25(OH)D levels at or above 20 ng/ml were classified as adequate. For 1,25(OH)2D, tertiles for circulating concentrations were created based on the population distribution of the metabolite.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>In order to evaluate trends in associations between CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 SNPs and vitamin D metabolites, linear regression was employed, with age and sex included as covariates. A logarithmic transformation was applied to the 25(OH)D variable to conform to the assumptions of normality. To test the association of SNPs with adenoma recurrence and advanced recurrence, multinomial logistic regression models which included age and sex as covariates were used. If a minor allele heterozygote was absent from an outcome, p-values were obtained via calculation of a z-score and conducting a two-tailed z test. Potentially confounding variables examined included race, body mass index, study, and dietary intake of vitamin D; however, none changed the point estimate by 10% or greater and they were excluded from the final model. To evaluate the relationships between SNPs, colorectal adenoma recurrence, and features of advanced colorectal adenomas, logistic regression modeling was employed, including the same covariates as the previous model. Finally, to test for interactions between SNPs and vitamin D metabolites in relation to adenoma recurrence, we constructed interaction terms for each SNP and 25(OH)D, and 1,25(OH)2D, and evaluated the terms within logistic regression models. When considering the statistical significance of results, a conservative Bonferroni adjustment for 15 tests set significance threshold of α=0.0033. All analyses were conducted in R Statistical software as well as Stata [version 9.0, Stata Corporation, College Station, TX].","Results<SEP>Descriptive characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. The mean (± sd) age of participants was 65.6 ± 8.5 years, with 68.3% of the participants being male and 93.3% white. The mean (± sd) concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D were 27.7 ± 11.4 ng/ml and 33.9 ± 11.3 pg/ml, respectively. A total of 519 (43.7%) individuals had a recurrent adenoma during study follow-up, and 28.6% of those had an advanced adenoma recurrence. Of adenoma recurrences, 28.1% were in the distal colorectum only; 45.9% were in the proximal colon, and 26.0% of those who had a recurrence had adenomas in both locations. Supplemental Table 1 presents the genomic location of SNPs, along with respective allele frequencies and genotype missing rates.<SEP>Table 2 shows the mean concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D by each CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 SNP genotype. A suggestive relationship between the CYP24A1 SNP rs927650 and concentrations of 25(OH)D was observed, with levels of 26.9 ± 8.5, 27.5 ± 12.8, and 29.1 ± 11.3 for the CC, TC, and TT genotypes, respectively. The results for the association between SNPs, overall colorectal adenoma recurrence, and advanced adenoma recurrence are presented in Table 3. There was a nominally statistically significant association between the CYP24A1 SNP rs927650 and odds for any adenoma recurrence, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.30 (0.99–1.70) and 1.38 (1.01–1.89) for each additional copy of the T allele, as compared to wild-type homozygotes (p-trend=0.04). In addition, there was a statistically significant relationship between the CYP24A1 SNP rs35051736 and odds for advanced recurrence (p<0.0001); this association arose because the minor allele (A) was completely absent in individuals with advanced lesions (n=162).<SEP>Table 4 shows the results for the associations between CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 SNPs and features of advanced colorectal adenoma recurrence. There was a nominally statistically significant association between increasing number of copies of the G allele in CYP24A1 rs2296241 and higher odds for recurrent adenomas with villous histology, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.19 (0.68–2.06) and 1.98 (1.12–3.50) for AG and GG genotypes, respectively, compared to AA (p-trend=0.02). Further, the minor allele for the CYP24A1 SNP rs35051736 was again absent among those presenting with a large or villous adenoma upon follow-up; however, these findings did not reach statistical significance.<SEP>We next sought to determine whether there were interactions between SNPs in CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 and vitamin D metabolite concentrations in relation to adenoma recurrence. Logistic regression analyses revealed nominally statistically significant interactions between CYP24A1 SNP rs2296241 and 25(OH)D (p-interaction=0.10), and rs2762939 in the same gene and 1,25(OH)2D (p-interaction=0.10). Further exploration of these interactions is presented in Table 5. The results suggest that increasing concentrations of 25(OH)D were significantly associated with reduced odds for adenoma recurrence only among those with at least one copy of the minor allele in rs2296241. Among individuals with the AA genotype, the ORs (95% CIs) for adenoma recurrence were 0.84 (0.27–2.61) for those with inadequate 25(OH)D concentrations (≥12 and <20 ng/ml) and 0.78 (0.27–2.30) for those with adequate levels (>20 ng/ml), respectively, compared to participants with vitamin D deficiency (<12 ng/ml). For heterozygotes, the ORs (95% CIs) were 0.23 (0.07–0.72) and 0.21 (0.07–0.62) for those who were inadequate and adequate, respectively, compared to deficient individuals. Finally, compared to those who were vitamin D deficient, participants who were homozygous for the minor allele and who had inadequate 25(OH)D concentrations had an OR (95% CI) of 0.13 (0.02–0.68) for adenoma recurrence; while those who were adequate had an OR (95% CI) of 0.18 (0.03–0.91). With regard to CYP24A1 rs2762939, the results suggest only a modestly reduced odds for adenoma recurrence among those with higher concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D and at least one copy of the minor allele.","Discussion<SEP>The findings of the present study demonstrated a suggestive association between the CYP24A1 SNP rs927650 and concentrations of 25(OH)D, but no relationship between SNPs in CYP27B1 or CYP24A1 and blood levels of 1,25(OH)2D. A nominally statistically significant association was observed for CYP24A1 rs927650 and odds of overall adenoma recurrence; while CYP24A1 rs35051736 was significantly associated with odds of advanced recurrence. Associations between CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 SNPs and features of advanced recurrent adenoma recurrence were observed. Statistically significant interactions were observed between the CYP24A1 SNPs rs2296241 and rs2762939 and concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D, respectively, in relation to overall adenoma recurrence. These findings indicate that the complexity of the vitamin D pathway may require further gene/environment investigations in order to fully clarify any role of the vitamin D pathway in colorectal neoplasia.<SEP>The relationship between low circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and increased risk of colorectal neoplasia has been reported consistently; though less common, studies of circulating 1,25(OH)2D concentrations have also revealed associations. The results for the main effects associations between 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D and colorectal adenomas in the present study population have been reported previously; however, the relationship between genetic variation in the vitamin D pathway genes CYP27B1 and CYP24A1, concentrations of these metabolites, and adenoma recurrence had not yet been investigated.<SEP>Several studies of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 SNPs and colorectal cancer have been conducted, with inconsistent results. Three studies showed no associations between SNPs in these genes and overall risk for colorectal cancer, while another report demonstrated a nominal relationship between the CYP24A1 polymorphism rs4809958 and risk for colon cancer. In the present study, no association between rs4809958 and overall adenoma recurrence, nor any adenoma characteristic, was observed, which is consistent with the majority of the published literature for colorectal cancer.<SEP>We observed a suggestive relationship between CYP24A1 rs927650 and overall adenoma recurrence. This SNP was previously identified as part of a haplotype that was significantly related to follicular thyroid cancer compared to controls; however, the directionality was the opposite of what was observed in the present study. Another CYP24A1 SNP of interest in the present work was rs35051736, for which there were no participants who were homozygous for the minor allele. This is perhaps not surprising given that this SNP is located two amino acids from another that was identified in a case-series to be associated with idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia. There was a complete absence of heterozygotes among participants with advanced adenomas, as well as among those with the component features of advanced lesions; namely, large or villous adenomas. In the polymorphic isotype of rs35051736, an uncharged glutamine is substituted for the original positively-charged arginine, resulting in possible changes in enzymatic activity. In prior work by our group, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to observe the functional effects of this SNP, and found a 31% reduction in activity of CYP24A1 in colon cancer cell lines. Because this enzyme is responsible for commencing the catabolism of 1,25(OH)2D, these results suggest that the presence of the A allele may result in greater concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D at the cellular level, which may in turn inhibit the development of colorectal neoplasia. Nonetheless, our results show that this finding did not extend to circulating blood concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D, where no differences in this metabolite were observed in association by rs35051736 genotype, nor did we find an association between blood levels of 1,25(OH)2D and villous histology in a previously-conducted study within the same study population. These findings underscore the importance of further characterizing the differences in blood measurements of vitamin D metabolites compared to activity at the cellular level in relation to the development of cancer.<SEP>We also observed significant associations between two CYP24A1 SNPs, rs2296241 and rs35051736, and odds for recurrent adenomas with advanced features. In the present study, increasing copies of the G allele in rs2296241 were related to increased odds for lesions with villous histology, a finding with similar directionality to another report showing that increasing copies of the G allele were associated with reduced overall survival among patients with head and neck cancers. In contrast, results of other studies have indicated that the presence of the G allele is protective, with reports showing that rs2296241 heterozygotes were at reduced risk for oral cancer, and for prostate-cancer specific deaths.<SEP>We observed no associations between CYP27B1 SNPs and concentrations of either 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH)2D, in contrast to other published studies. The CYP27B1 SNP most commonly reported to have a significant relationship with 25(OH)D in prior epidemiological studies is rs10877012. However, the direction of the association between genotypes and 25(OH)D varied between the studies, the minor allele frequency is relatively rare, and limited or no functional data are available; therefore, this variant was not selected for the present study. In addition, a suggestive trend between the CYP24A1 SNP rs927650 and circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D was found which has not been reported previously, and this SNP was also related to colorectal adenoma recurrence. However, the alleles associated with higher 25(OH)D concentrations were also related to increased risk for colorectal adenoma recurrence, which was unexpected given well-documented inverse association between 25(OH)D and colorectal neoplasia. Nonetheless, our prior work has shown that there was no association between 25(OH)D and overall adenoma recurrence in our study population, which partially explain this apparently contradictory finding. A prior genome-wide association study conducted with approximately 30,000 participants reported an significant relationship between rs6013897 and concentrations of 25(OH)D; however, we observed no associations for this SNP in our study population. Another investigation reported associations for rs2244719, rs17219315, and rs2296241, the latter of which was included in the current work; however, no relationship between this SNP and concentrations of either metabolite was observed. These findings highlight the potential differences in SNP/outcome associations that may be detected depending on the population under study; specifically, these prior reports have included participants from differing racial or ethnic groups, and/or with conditions such as diabetes or asthma.<SEP>In addition to the investigation of the main effects for CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 in adenoma recurrence and circulating vitamin D metabolite concentrations, interactions between these SNPs, 25(OH)D, and 1,25(OH)2D in relation to adenoma recurrence were studied. Significant interactions between CYP24A1 rs2296241 and 25(OH)D levels, and between CYP24A1 rs2762939 and 1,25(OH)2D, were observed. For rs2296241, the data indicated that the inverse association between 25(OH)D and overall colorectal adenoma recurrence was stronger among those carrying at least one G allele. However, these results are not consistent with the findings for this SNP in relation to villous adenoma recurrence, which showed that increasing copies of the G allele was related to increased odds for these advanced lesions. As noted above, statistically significant results for another SNP, rs2762939 have been reported in several studies, but the directionality of any association remains inconsistent. We found that a modestly stronger inverse association between 1,25(OH)D and adenoma recurrence in the presence of at least on minor allele in rs2762939. This SNP has previously been reported to be associated with risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and prostate cancer progression, though again there is inconsistency in the directionality of the associations.<SEP>There were both strengths and limitations to this study. Strengths include that this was the first investigation of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 SNPs in relation to colorectal adenoma recurrence and was conducted in a large sample size that allowed for consideration of gene/environment interactions between specifically-selected polymorphisms and vitamin D metabolite concentrations. Limitations include the relative homogeneity of the study population with regard to race and ethnicity, particularly given the known variation in vitamin D metabolite concentrations and genotype frequencies by racial or ethnic group.<SEP>In summary, the findings of the present study suggest that the CYP24A1 SNP rs927650 may be related to both circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D as well as to odds of recurrent colorectal neoplasia. In addition, there were modest indications that at least one genetic variant with known functional effects may be related to odds for the development of advanced colorectal adenomas. The rarity of this variant would require a larger study population in order to confirm any associations with confidence. Finally, the results of this work highlight the need to continue to clarify the differences between the results of epidemiological studies of circulating vitamin D metabolites and genetic variants, and experimental work at the cellular level.",23917,['VITMIN']
33864587,"Introduction<SEP>The term Idiopathic Infantile Hypercalcemia (IIH, OMIM 143880) first received attention almost 70 years ago in the UK, when symptomatic hypercalcemia was observed in infants after receiving high doses of vitamin D for the prevention of rickets <SEP>Pathogenic variants (PVs) in the CYP24A1 gene, involved in the degradation of vitamin-D, have been identified as being a relevant part of the IIH etiology. In particular, the clinical and biological role of CYP24A1 gene, encoding the vitamin D-24-hydroxylase, lies in the metabolism of the 1,25(OH)2D, the physiologically active form of vitamin D. CYP24A1 enzyme is responsible of the 1,25(OH)2D catabolism and also it enhances the turnover and elimination of the 25(OH)D, the abundant precursor metabolite and storage form of vitamin D. PVs in the CYP24A1 gene can lead to elevated levels of 1,25(OH)2D, cause of pathological absorptive hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. In the affected subjects, this condition may predispose to renal complications such as nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. Moreover, calcium deposition in mitochondrial structures, with a consequent damage of metabolism, may lead to renal epithelium impairment and tubular necrosis, potentially resulting in chronic kidney disease.<SEP>In this context, it is emphasized the importance of evaluation of CYP24A1 gene as a crucial advanced diagnostic tool in the definitive diagnosis of IIH; furthermore, the CYP24A1 PVs identification can be useful for the improvement of target therapeutic strategies, principally aimed to the control of calcium imbalance and the prevention of progression to chronic kidney disease.","Materials and methods<SEP>DNA extraction<SEP>After obtaining a written informed consent from patient’s parents, molecular analysis of CYP24A1 gene was performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by an automatic DNA device (MagCore HF16 Plus, Diatech Lab Line, Jesi, Italy) with MagCore Genomic DNA Whole Blood Kit (RBC Bioscience Corp. TAIWAN). The DNA concentration and purity were tested using QFX Fluorometer (DeNovix Inc., Wilmington, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.<SEP>DNA sequencing<SEP>Samples were amplified using primers selected to cover all coding exons and flanking intronic regions of CYP24A1, as previously reported. PCR products were bi-directionally sequenced using the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit on the Applied Biosystems 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The data were then analyzed with both SeqScape® software v.3 and Sequencing Analysis Software v.6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).<SEP>HRM design, optimization and conditions<SEP>To develop a duplex assay able to detect the two abovementioned variants, the design of new primers pair for the c.1186C > T variant was made taking into account the melting characteristics of the one already used in our laboratory for the c.428_430delAAG detection. Particularly, in order to use the same annealing temperature (Ta) we used the freely available software Primer3 (http://primer3.ut.ee/). The designed primers amplify an amplicon of 59 bp surrounding the c.1186C > T variant and have the following sequence: forward (F) 5′-AGGCTTACGCCGAGTGTAC-3′ and reverse (R) 5′-CCCAGAACTGTTGCCTTGTC-3′. In addition, to avoid overlapping between the two target amplicons, we used Oligo Calc software (biotools.nubic.northwestern.edu/OligoCalc.html) for melting temperature (Tm) prediction. To optimize the test, we firstly performed the PCR-HRMA only for the c.1186C > T variant in order to verify: 1) the Ta, 2) absence of aspecific products or primer’s dimer and finally 3) to confirm the predicted Tm of designed fragment. Subsequently, a duplex-PCR was performed to evaluate the amplification performance of both target amplicons. Consequently, we optimized the primers’ concentration to achieve a balanced amplification. After that, and once the parameters are set for each target, duplex PCR/HRMA was carried out using the LightCycler® 480 Real-Time PCR systems (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) on a 20 μL reaction mixture containing 2X LightCycler® 480 High-Resolution Melting Master (including buffer, Taq polymerase, nucleotides and proprietary ds-DNA saturating binding dye), 2.5 nM of MgCl2, 15 ng DNA template and primers. The rs777676129 and rs114368325 primers were used at final concentration of 0.15 and 0.30 μM, respectively.<SEP>PCR conditions included an initial hold at 95 °C for 10′ followed by 55 cycles with a denaturation step at 95 °C for 10′′ and a combined annealing/elongation step at 59 °C for 15″and 72 °C 10′, respectively. The melting program included denaturation at 95 °C for 1′, renaturation at 40 °C for 1′ and subsequent melting consisting of a continuous reading of fluorescent.<SEP>HRMA<SEP>Melting curve analysis was performed using the Gene Scanning Software (version 1.2, Roche Diagnostics) with “Gene scanning” and “Tm calling” tools. The normalization settings were the following: pre-melting normalization (76.42–77.37 °C), post-melting normalization (86.56–87.51 °C) and temperature shift with a threshold = 1. HRMA of both shape and peak height was performed in duplicate for each sample.","Results<SEP>HRMA<SEP>For HRMA set up, available samples with known CYP24A1 status were used as positive and wild-type (wt) controls. In details, n = 2 samples with the c.428_430delAAG variant and n = 2 samples with the c.1186C > T variant (homozygous and heterozygous). Two samples with no CYP24A1 variants were used as wt controls. Furthermore, we also included n = 1 compound heterozygous sample, carrying both variants tested. As above mentioned, the two sets of primers have been designed ad hoc to amplify two different target sequences and, consequently, each amplicon are indicative of only one common mutant site in CYP24A1 gene. The Tm difference between the two wt amplicons was at least 6 °C and, consequently, the associated Tm profiles did not overlap (Fig. 1). Due to these melting characteristics and behavior, the two HRMA could be performed and analyzed at same time in a duplex assay.<SEP>For all samples, the genotype assignment obtained by dHRMA was concordant with results of single plex HRMA and Sanger sequencing. In fact, we were able to clearly genotype all samples by evaluating their specific melting profiles along with the Tm values. The different CYP24A1 genotypes exhibit a specific melting behavior, as observed in both Normalized and Temperature-shifted and Different Plot (Fig. 2). Because the Tms of the two amplicons were clearly different, in each sample we can observe two different genotyping curves, each related to one locus. In detail, the melting peaks of rs777676129 amplicons were: 85.14 °C, 84.68 °C and 85.35 °C for wt, heterozygous and homozygous genotypes, respectively. The rs114368325 amplicons showed Tm of 79.37 °C, 78.69 °C and 78.81 °C of wt, heterozygous and homozygous genotypes, respectively. Furthermore, we were also able to identify the compound heterozygosis by evaluating its specific melting profile (Fig. 3) as well as the Tm shift compared to the wt ones (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 4, all genotypes were clearly distinguishable from wt sample.<SEP>Moreover, all genotypes obtained from the duplex HRMA were confirmed by sequencing.<SEP>Validation and sensitivity of HRMA<SEP>To validate our protocol, duplex-PCR/HRMA was performed on further 10 DNA samples with the suspicion of IIH. Among of these, we found 1 heterozygous for the c.428_430delAAG and 1 heterozygous for the c.1186C > T variants. All HRMA results were verified by direct DNA sequencing, which confirmed all the genotypes, achieving 100% of concordance.<SEP>We evaluated the intra-assay precision analyzing 5 replicates of one single wild-type and homozygous/heterozygous samples, respectively. Furthermore, the inter-assay precision was assessed running the same wild-type, homozygous and heterozygous samples in triplicates on 3 different PCR/HRM experiments. We achieved a full superimposability and reproducibility of melting profiles and Tm.<SEP>In order to test the sensitivity of HRMA, we evaluated serial dilutions (1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16) of wt, homozygous and heterozygous DNAs, starting from 15 ng/μL. Melting curves of positive samples were still well differentiated as compared to wt ones, until the lowest variant allele frequency investigated (data not shown).","Discussion<SEP>The patient described herein presents typical clinical signs of CYP24A1 loss-of-function variants, as the c.1186C > T, an Italian hot spot PV. The major strength of the current study was to set up an efficient and robust molecular test based on duplex assay coupled with HRMA to screen two Italian hot spot PVS in CYP24A1 gene, implementing the previous our molecular diagnostic workflow for IIH disease. This new approach was able to clearly discriminate the c.428_430delAAG and the c.1186C > T allele in either heterozygous or homozygous status, simultaneously.<SEP>Herein, HRMA strategy proves a flexible methodology that allowed us to develop a sensitive, cost-effective and less-laborious duplex HRM assay to unambiguous genotype the two most frequent CYP24A1 PVs (rs777676129 and rs114368325) in Italian cohort simultaneously within a single tube. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first HRMA approach to rapidly screen the two most frequent CYP24A1 PVs in peculiar cases with typical clinical signs of IIH disease.<SEP>IIH is a rare disease characterized by wide range of clinical signs as failure to thrive, dehydration, vomiting, nephrocalcinosis, and hypercalcemia. In the past, IIH was diagnosed after exclusion of other conditions related to development of hypercalcemia, such as Williams-Beuren syndrome, hyperparathyroidism, diuretic usage, and excess vitamin D intake. Currently, PVs in CYP24A1, which encodes the enzyme 24-hydroxylase responsible for degradation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-OH-D), were associated with IIH. Since the identification that PVs in CYP24A1 are responsible for IIH, many case reports have been reported, leading to an increased insight into clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics of this disease. To date, a total of 41 PVs associated with IIH were identified for the CYP24A1, emphasizing how CYP24A1 genetic test was critical and essential for the final diagnosis of IIH. Nevertheless, many questions remain unanswered as the specific prevalence of the disease, the existence of a genotype–phenotype correlation and the best treatment of hypercalcemia.<SEP>In the first Italian report, performed in a small cohort of patients, Gigante et al. . describes 6 different CYP24A1 mutation, including one small deletion (p.Glu143del), 4 missense mutations (p.Leu148Pro; p.Arg396Trp; p.Pro503 Leu; p.Glu383Gln) and one non sense mutation (p.Tyr220*). Recently, Brancatella et al., screened for CYP24A1 mutations a large Italian family, reporting a nonsense CYP24A1 gene mutation, the (p.Arg223*), previously described by two other research groups. Even if the exact frequencies of these mutations in a large cohort of IIH patients are not currently available, the c.428_430delAAG p.(Glu143del) (rs777676129) and the c.1186C > T p.(Arg396Trp) (rs114368325), detected in about 50% of all Italian patients, represents the two hot spot PVs in CYP24A1 gene in an Italian cohort.<SEP>Given the high prevalence of these PVs in Italian cohort, the development of an efficient molecular screening test for CYP24A1 represents an improvement of clinical laboratory routine.<SEP>Although Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are two of most common mutation detection methods for large-scale genomics sequencing samples, they can be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, NGS method generates a large quantity of data, which is not always necessary; moreover, NGS results usually require validation and complex bioinformatics analysis for interpretation. In this context, alternative method of analysis, as HRMA, might serve as a complementary approach for detecting the presence genetic variants. HRM is an efficient and rapid scanning method that can dramatically reduce the amount of sequencing. HRMA is highly suitable for the detection of single-base variants, deletions, or insertions. In addition, HRMA offers several attractive advantages over other conventional gene scanning methods, such as no post-PCR processing steps, complete closed-tube format, and rapid turnaround time.",12549,['VITMIN']
20799318,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive neurodegenerative disease associated with abnormal copper metabolism. This disorder is caused by loss-of- function mutations in ATP7A, a P-type ATPase with a critical role in copper transport from the gastrointestinal lumen to the bloodstream and subsequently into the brain, as well as in the intracellular delivery of copper to the trans-Golgi compartment, for loading onto secreted copper enzymes such as tyrosinase, dopamine-β-hydroxylase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, and lysyl oxidase. Numerous clinical manifestations of Menkes disease reflect these copper transport defects and include failure to thrive, temperature instability, seizures, hypotonia, global developmental delay, light pigmentation, coarse hair, lax skin, osteopenia, vascular tortuousity, arterial and venous aneurysms, and bladder diverticula. Death by three years of age is typical although very early diagnosis and treatment with copper injections improves survival and neurological outcomes.<SEP>The precise mechanisms that facilitate delivery of copper and other metals into the brain are not completely understood, although the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers are assumed to control these processes. Brain capillary endothelial cells comprise the blood-brain barrier throughout the central nervous system and derive from angioblasts of mesodermal lineage. In contrast, the epithelia of choroid plexuses, which abut the two lateral, the third, and the fourth ventricles of the brain, represent the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and clearly derive from neuroectoderm. Choroid plexus epithelial cells are polarized, with their basolateral surfaces facing a dense core of capillaries and loose connective tissue stroma, and their apical surfaces projecting into the cerebrospinal fluid-filled ventricles. These specialized cells regulate the chemical composition of the cerebrospinal fluid.<SEP>Several known copper transport genes (ATP7A, ATP7B, CTR1) are expressed in mammalian cells that comprise the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers. Animal models support the importance of ATP7A and CTR1 for copper delivery to brain; mice with defects in these genes show markedly reduced brain copper content. Despite this knowledge, many questions remain about copper intake, export, and utilization within both the central and peripheral nervous systems.<SEP>Somatic mosaicism, the occurrence of two or more genetically distinct cell lines in an organism, has been noted in many single gene disorders. This phenomenon may occur via chromosomal abnormalities, epigenetic alterations of DNA, post-zygotic DNA mutations, and spontaneous reversion of inherited mutations. Selection in favor or against cells harboring the mutant allele may impact clinical and biochemical phenotypes. Somatic mosaicism has not been reported in Menkes disease; here we describe and characterize the first known example which, in correlation with the biochemical and clinical phenotype, sheds light on the normal process of copper entry to the developing brain.","PATIENT AND METHODS<SEP>All patients and patient specimens were studied under protocols approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) following informed parental consent.<SEP>Patient<SEP>The proband was a 20-month-old male infant referred to the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health after being diagnosed with Menkes disease. He was evaluated under NIH protocol #09-CH-0059 approved by the NICHD Institutional Review Board. He was born to a 30-year-old gravida 2 para 2 mother (first pregnancy was twin) after an uneventful pregnancy. Normal spontaneous vaginal delivery occurred at 35 weeks gestation with birth weight 2.35 kg. By 7 months of age, clinical seizure activity was suspected and global developmental delays were documented. Comparative genomic hybridization, standard karyotyping, fragile X testing, and DNA methylation analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome were normal. A brain MRI at 8 months of age showed evidence of delayed myelination. Physical stigmata of Menkes disease, osteopenia, and bladder diverticula later suggested Menkes disease. The diagnosis was delayed because the typical biochemical markers of the disease including low copper and abnormal catecholamine levels in blood [White et al., 1992; ] were not evident. At 18 months of age, mutation screening of the ATP7A locus in genomic DNA from whole blood cells revealed a sequence alteration in the heterozygous state at base 3002 in exon 15. Both cytosine (normal) and thymidine bases were detected, indicating somatic mosaicism for a c.3002C>T mutation which predicts a proline to leucine amino acid substitution (p.P1001L). The patient was referred to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).<SEP>Cell Culture<SEP>A primary fibroblast culture was established from a skin biopsy obtained from the patient. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin.<SEP>Other Patients<SEP>Unused cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 11 normal control patients undergoing lumbar puncture for medical reasons was obtained under a protocol approved by the Children’s Research Institute IRB, Children’s National Medical Center, Washington, DC. Baseline cerebrospinal fluid (n=10) and urine (n=9) specimens from Menkes disease patients studied under protocol 90-CH-0149 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00001262), approved by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke IRB, were obtained prior to initiating copper treatment.<SEP>Cerebrospinal Fluid Copper Determinations<SEP>Copper levels in cerebrospinal fluid were determined via atomic absorption spectrometry in a graphite furnace (Model AAnalyst 800, Perkin-Elmer Corporation, New Jersey). Prior to analysis, cerebrospinal fluid samples were thawed from storage at −70°C to room temperature. Samples were diluted two-fold with 0.1% HNO3 (JT Baker). All chemicals were of analytical-reagent grade or higher purity. Deionized water from a Milli-Q system (Millipore) was used for the analyses. The method for determining the calibration curve (linear, through zero) used certified standard reference materials at 2ppb, 5ppb, and 10ppb from High Purity Standards (Charleston, SC). Calibration curves had a correlation coefficient of at least 0.9989. Two dilutions were made for each specimen, and each dilution was measured in triplicate. Measurements were used only if the standard deviation of the three measurements was less than 12%. The resulting data represent an average of two triplicate measurements.<SEP>Catecholamine Levels<SEP>Catecholamine levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid from the proband were measured by high performance liquid chromatography, as previously described and the ratios of dihydroxyphenylalanine: dihydroxyphenylglycol (DOPA:DHPG) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid: dihydroxyphenylglycol (DOPAC:DHPG) were compared to results in normal pediatric and adult controls.<SEP>Molecular Analyses of Somatic Mosaicism<SEP>The c.3002C>T mutation creates a novel BsmAI site in exon 15, which allowed for quantification of normal and mutant cells in tissue specimens from the patient, using two approaches.<SEP>Semi-quantitative assessment<SEP>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify genomic DNA isolated from whole blood and fibroblasts using primers (forward: 5′-AATACGATTTGCTTTCCAAGCCTC-3′; reverse: 5′-AGCACCTACTCCTGTACCC-3′) specific for ATP7A exon 15. The 294 bp PCR products generated were purified using a DNA isolation kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), digested with BsmAI (NEB, Beverly, MA) and electrophoresed through 2% agarose. In the presence of P1001L, BsmAI digestion produces two fragments of sizes 158 bp and 136 bp. To estimate the relative quantities of normal and mutant alleles, the 294 bp and 158 bp fragments were digitized and quantitated by densitometry using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) for each sample. The digestion and quantitation was performed in triplicate for both tissues.<SEP>Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR)<SEP>Q-RT-PCR was carried out in triplicate using SYBR® Green JumpStart™ Taq ReadyMix™ (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) on a DNA Engine Opticon® (Model CFD-3200). Genomic DNA (350 ng) from the patient and a normal male control was digested with 5 units of BsmAI or mock-digested (no enzyme added) for 2 hours at 55°C. Following digestion, the genomic DNA was purified and the ATP7A exon 15 specific primers noted above were used to amplify the region containing the patient’s mutation. Concurrently, a similar-sized region of ATP7A exon 8 without a BsmAI site was amplified (forward: 5′-GAAGCTTCTTTGGTCAAGAAGG-3′; reverse: 5′-TCAAAATCTGTTTTTTACTGACACTCC-3′ primer sequences), as well as a similar-sized region of exon 7 containing a BsmAI site (forward: 5′-AATGACGTGTGCCTCCTGCG-3′; reverse: 5′-GTGCTTTGTTGGTTGCCAGGG-3′ primer sequences). Quantitation of the exon 15 target was normalized to the exon 8 target for both digested and undigested samples using the expression 2CT(exon15)/ 2CT(exon8) where CT represents cycle threshold. The normalized quantity of exon 15 target in the digested sample (i.e., in which the mutant allele is removed by digestion) was divided by that of the undigested sample (in which both alleles are present) to determine the fraction of cells harboring the normal allele, as in the combined expression:  <SEP>Analysis of exon 7 was used to assess efficiency of BsmAI digestion.","RESULTS<SEP>Clinical Outcome and Diagnostic Tests<SEP>At 20 months of age, the patient’s developmental skill levels, as assessed by the Denver Developmental Screening Test II, included gross motor, 5 months; fine motor, 7 months; language, 7 months; and personal-social, 11 months. A brain MRI at 20 months of age showed atrophy and delayed myelination (Fig. 1). Clinical neurophysiology studies were normal, showing median nerve compound motor action potentials of 6.5 mV at the L wrist and 5.5 mV at the L elbow (normal value for 1–2 yr old infants: ≥3.5 mV), and median nerve conduction velocity of 50 m/s (normal value for 1–2 yr old infants: ≥35 m/s). Median nerve sensory action potential was 36 μV (normal value for 1–2 yr old infants: ≥15 μV).<SEP>Biochemical Findings<SEP>Table I summarizes biochemical findings in the proband. His serum copper level was normal. Urine b2-microglobulin, a marker of renal tubular injury due to copper overload that is elevated in patients with Menkes disease, was also normal. Plasma catecholamine ratios, which reflect deficient activity of dopamine-b-hydroxylase, a copper-dependent enzyme, were not consistent with Menkes disease. In contrast, cerebrospinal fluid copper and catecholamine ratios fell within the ranges established for classical Menkes disease (Table I).<SEP>Molecular Analyses<SEP>We confirmed mosaicism for the P1001L mutation in the proband’s genomic DNA (data not shown). The mutant allele was not detected in the mother. P1001L creates a novel BsmAI restriction site (Fig. 2A). PCR and BsmAI digestion indicated a different level of mosaicism in the patient’s blood compared to that in a primary fibroblast culture obtained from his skin biopsy. The wild type allele (294 bp fragment) was markedly less abundant in the latter tissue compared to the patient’s blood DNA and that from a normal control (Fig. 2B). We used densitometry to estimate the relative proportions of fragments associated with the wild type and mutant alleles in both tissues which indicated a wild type: mutant allele ratios of 77:23 in whole blood DNA and 12:88 in fibroblast DNA. We also used quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) experiments to compare mosaicism between tissues, which produced similar results, a wild type: mutant ratio of 69:31 in blood versus 12:88 in primary fibroblasts (Table I). The control for completeness of BsmA1 digestion (ATP7A exon 7) by Q-RT-PCR indicated 99% digestion in these experiments.","DISCUSSION<SEP>We describe the first known example of somatic mosaicism for Menkes disease. Somatic mosaicism is known to affect clinical and biochemical phenotypes in numerous genetic disorders by selection in favor or against cells harboring the mutant allele. The proline 1001 residue is part of a highly conserved cysteine-proline-cysteine (CPC) transmembrane metal-biding site embedded in the sixth transmembrane domain of ATP7A, that is responsible for metal recognition and movement across the membrane permeability barrier. Therefore, it seems likely that P1001L would completely abrogate ATP7A function in cells that harbor it. Selection against mutant ATP7A alleles was suggested in tissue culture studies, and a higher percentage of normal cells might be expected on this basis for tissues that undergo turnover, e.g., blood, gastrointestinal epithelium, renal tubular epithelium.<SEP>The patient’s normal blood copper levels connote adequate copper transport at the level of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, which are derived from embryologic endoderm. The absence of elevated b2-microglobulin in the patient’s urine indicates that ATP7A function in renal tubular epithelial cells, derived from embryologic mesoderm, is also adequate. Since the endothelial cells of brain capillaries that comprise the blood-brain barrier are, like all vasculature, formed from angioblasts of mesodermal lineage, we speculate that copper transport at the blood-brain barrier in this patient was not significantly impaired. However, he clearly manifests neurodevelopmental delays, as well as abnormal brain imaging (Fig. 1), and cerebrospinal fluid biochemical findings (Table I) that are consistent with severe Menkes disease and profound central nervous system copper deficiency.<SEP>The absence of chromosomal abnormalities or epigenetic alterations, the low likelihood of spontaneous reversion of an ATP7A mutation, and the absence of the P1001L allele in the patient’s mother all suggest that this mutation occurred after fertilization during an early stage of embryogenesis. We documented disparate levels of mosaicism in two tissues derived from different embryonic origins: the mutation was present at 23–31% frequency in whole blood (mesoderm-derived), compared with 88% in cultured fibroblasts from skin (ectoderm-derived). These molecular findings imply that the P1001L mutation in the patient preceded formation of the three primary embryonic lineages at gastrulation, with the ectoderm layer ultimately harboring a higher percentage of mutation-bearing cells than mesoderm or endoderm. Since the polarized epithelia of the choroid plexuses are clearly derived from ectoderm, whereas brain capillary endothelial cells derive from mesodermal angioblasts, this infant’s clinical and biochemical findings strongly suggest that copper entry to the developing brain is primarily choroid plexus-mediated.<SEP>The polarized epithelia of choroid plexuses project their apical surfaces into the cerebrospinal fluid, with the basolateral sides facing the underlying capillaries. Although in most epithelial cells, ATP7A localizes to the basolateral surface following copper loading, we have hypothesized that a reversal of protein sorting in choroid plexus epithelia results in ATP7A trafficking to the apical surface where it mediates brain copper delivery. Choroid plexuses clearly mediate brain entry of manganese, another member of the transition metal family. ATP7A could embed in the apical plasma membrane to pump copper across or, alternatively, may be associated with copper-laden vesicles that fuse with the apical surface and release copper into the cerebrospinal fluid. In support of this general concept, the Na+/K+ ATPase localizes to the apical rather than the basolateral membrane of choroid plexus epithelia, while all other polarized cells express Na+/K+ ATPase basolaterally.<SEP>Our biochemical and molecular findings provide new evidence that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier is the primary route of copper delivery to the developing brain. If mesodermally derived tissues possess 69–77% levels of wild type ATP7A (Table I), brain capillary endothelial cells would not block copper entry. However, copper entry clearly was impaired throughout infancy in this patient and likely explains his Menkes disease phenotype. Thus, the ectodermally derived choroid plexus epithelia, presumably possessing only about 12% of the wild type allele, represents the location at which copper transport was likely defective.<SEP>In summary, we identified a Menkes disease patient with somatic mosaicism for a missense mutation, P1001L, in ATP7A that varied quantitatively between tissues from different embryonic lineages. The patient manifested a classic severe Menkes disease phenotype presumably due to the relatively higher frequency of cells harboring the disease-causing sequence variant in ectoderm, from which the choroid plexus epithelia are derived.",17046,['VITMIN']
21459128,"Introduction<SEP>There is increasing evidence that genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can alter nutrient metabolism and responses to changes in nutrient supply. The interaction between such functional genetic variants and diet is likely to underlie many multifactorial diseases [e.g. ]. Sub-optimal intake of the micronutrient selenium (Se) has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and prostate and colorectal cancers. The metabolic functions of Se are thought to be due to its presence as selenocysteine in ~ 25 selenoproteins in mammals. Many of these proteins, including the glutathione peroxidases (GPx) and thioredoxin reductases (TR), are thought to have antioxidant and redox functions and protect cells from oxidative stress and cell damaging agents. As a result, SNPs in selenoprotein genes may be expected to affect antioxidant functions.<SEP>Se is incorporated into selenoproteins during protein synthesis using UGA as the codon for selenocysteinyl-tRNA; this requires a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in the 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) of the mRNAs and specific proteins that bind to these RNA structures . When Se supply is limiting there is a tissue-specific prioritisation of selenoprotein synthesis so that synthesis of certain proteins is maintained at the expense of synthesis of others and this leads to differential effects of Se supply on the levels of both the selenoproteins and their corresponding mRNAs. This prioritisation, often referred to as the selenoprotein hierarchy, is partly dependent on differences in the ability of the different 3′UTR sequences to interact with the selenocysteine incorporation machinery. As a result, SNPs in the selenoprotein gene regions corresponding to the 3′UTR could have functional effects, potentially affecting not only the synthesis of the selenoprotein coded by the gene containing the SNP but also the synthesis of other selenoproteins.<SEP>A T/C variation (rs713041) in the region of the GPX4 gene that corresponds to the 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) of the mRNA has been found in Caucasian and Asian populations. Using a transfected cell model expressing a selenoprotein iodothyronine deiodinase (IDI) reporter gene the variants have been shown to drive selenoprotein synthesis to different extents. Furthermore, results from a human supplementation trial suggest that this SNP affects expression of lymphocyte GPx1 and GPx4, and in vitro assays with Caco-2 cell extracts indicate that the T and C variants of the 3′UTR show different protein binding characteristics, suggesting that the variants differ in their ability to interact with the Se incorporation machinery. However, it is not known if the SNP affects either the cells' ability to respond to an oxidative challenge or the hierarchy of selenoprotein synthesis.<SEP>The aim of the present work was to investigate whether the T and C variants of this SNP differ in their ability to affect these parameters. To do this we produced stable clones of transfected Caco-2 cells over-expressing comparable amounts of transcripts encoding the selenoprotein iodothyronine deiodinase linked to the GPX4 3′UTR containing either T or C variant. These transfected cells were used to assess the impact of the presence of T and C variant transcripts on selenoprotein expression and response to a tert-butylhydroperoxide challenge. The results are consistent with over-expression of transcripts containing the C variant of rs713041 having a greater effect on the selenoprotein hierarchy than the T variant.","Methods<SEP>Cell culture<SEP>Caco-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% foetal calf serum and penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For growth of cells in a specific concentration of selenium, cells were grown in serum free DMEM with added insulin (5 μg/ml) and transferrin (5 μg/ml) and varying concentrations of sodium selenite, as described previously. Caco-2 cells are heterozygous C/T for rs713041.<SEP>DNA transfection<SEP>The construction of the pCDNA3.1/Zeo (+) plasmids containing the coding region of rat type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (IDI) with the 3′UTR of GPX4 containing either a T (IDI-GPX4(T)) or a C (IDI-GPX4(C)) at position 718 was described previously. Caco-2 cells were transfected at 90–95% confluency with endotoxin-free IDI-GPX4(T) or IDI-GPX4(C) plasmids (μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (μl) (Invitrogen) in a 1:3.5 ratio according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 hours, the cells were split (1:5) and grown for an additional 24 hours in normal media. Cells were then grown in a selective media containing 200 μg/ml of the antibiotic zeocin and stably transfected colonies isolated for both IDI-GPX4(T) or IDI-GPX4(C) transfected cells. Two IDI-GPX4(T) and two IDI-GPX4(C) clones were selected for use in further experiments based on their IDI expression levels.<SEP>Cell viability assays<SEP>Ninety-six well plates were seeded with 6 × 104 cells/well, and after 24 hours half the cells were treated with varying concentrations of tert-butylhydroperoxide diluted in media. After 4 hours the medium containing tert-butylhydroperoxide was removed and fresh medium added to the cells. Cell viability was assessed by the addition of 20 μl of CellTiter-Blue® reagent (Promega) and after 4 hours absorbance was measured at 560 nm.<SEP>ROS measurement<SEP>Cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in 96 well plates and grown for 2 days. To induce ROS production, cells were incubated for 4 hours with 100 μM tert-butylhydroperoxide, following instructions from the manufacturers of the detection kit. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red (HBSS; from Invitrogen) before incubation with 25 μM 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen)) and 0.5 μM Hoechst 33342 dye diluted in HBSS . After 15 minutes incubation the cells were then washed twice with HBSS after which 50 μl of HBSS was added to each well. Florescence of the two dyes was measured by excitation at 485 nm and detection of emitted fluorescence at 520 nm for carboxy-H2DCFDA, and by excitation at 355 nm and detection of emitted fluorescence at 460 nm for Hoechst 33342.<SEP>RT-PCR<SEP>Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline before total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) and purified using PureLink™ columns (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesised at 55 °C for 30 minutes from 1 μg of total RNA using Oligo-dT primers and transcriptor reverse transcriptase (Roche). Endogenous mRNA levels were measured on equivalent amounts of total RNA by real-time using a Roche LightCycler 480 and SYBR Green PCR master mix (Roche). Primers used for the real time PCR were as follows:<SEP>The thermal profile for PCR consisted of 94 °C for 2 minutes, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 seconds, 59 °C for 45 seconds, 72 °C for 1 minute and finally 2 minutes at 72 °C. Samples and negative controls were analysed in triplicate and the amount of mRNA normalised to GAPDH mRNA. Relative quantification was carried out from a standard curve using dilutions of purified PCR products obtained with appropriate primer sets.<SEP>Selenoprotein assays<SEP>Caco-2 cell extracts were prepared by resuspending cell pellets into 0.1% Triton (peroxide-free) in PBS, sonication for 10 seconds and centrifugation at 3500g for 10 minutes. GPx activity in the supernatant fluid was determined by the method of Paglia and Valentine as modified by Brown et al. using hydrogen peroxide as a substrate. One unit of GPx activity is defined as that which oxidises 1 μmol of NADPH/min. GPx4 protein levels were measured by a competitive ELISA using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (raised against the whole human recombinant GPx4 protein) and human recombinant GPx4 protein (both LabFrontier (Seoul, Korea)). The ELISA was performed in 96-well plates that were coated with the polyclonal anti-human GPX4 antibody at 1:10,000 dilution. The ELISA used the principle of competitive binding whereby calibrator/sample and biotinylated human GPX4 competed for binding to the GPX4 antibody-coated wells. For the signal reagent, NeutrAvidin (Perbio, Cramlington, UK) horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:10,000 in 0.5% casein was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. The plates were then washed three times with PBS/Tween. Tetramethylbenzidine was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for up to 15 minutes. The reaction was stopped with 0.18 M of H2SO4 and the absorbance read at 450 nM. TR1 protein levels were also measured by competitive ELISA using rabbit anti-TR1 antiserum (a gift from Dr Forbes Howie, University of Edinburgh) at a final dilution of 1:30,000 and recombinant TR1 protein obtained from Labfrontier (Seoul, Korea). TR1 protein was biotinylated using a commercial kit (Sigma, UK) and a calibration curve prepared over a range of concentrations (0.3–40 ng/ml).","Results<SEP>Caco-2 cells do not express deiodinase at a level detectable by enzyme assay. Following transfection of Caco-2 cells with rat IDI coding sequences linked to the GPX4 3′UTR with either the T (IDI-T) or C (IDI-C) variant corresponding to rs713041, IDI transcripts were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time PCR using primers specific to rat IDI that did not detect human IDI sequences in untransfected Caco-2 cells (results not shown). For both variants there was an up to 10-fold range of expression of the transgene between the various clones. Since the two variants differ only in the 3′UTR, assessment of their relative effects was carried out in clones selected on the basis that they expressed IDI-T and IDI-C transcripts at comparable levels. In the first series of experiments two clones expressing IDI-T and two expressing IDI-C transcripts at similar levels were selected and the mean IDI transcript levels (as arbitrary units relative to GAPDH) in the clones studied were 0.51 ± 0.1 and 0.30 ± 0.1 for the IDI-T and IDI-C cells respectively.<SEP>Overall cell viability of the cells was assessed after an oxidative challenge without distinguishing between necrotic and apoptotic cell death. In order to allow us to carry out such experiments without lengthening periods of altered Se supply, viability was measured within hours of the challenge. When grown in normal medium untransfected Caco-2 cells showed considerable resistance to tert-butylhydroperoxide and a concentration of 3 mM was chosen as the challenge since it led to approximately 50% cell viability under these conditions. In Se-depleted medium a lower concentration of tert-butylhydroperoxide was used as the challenge because of the additional sensitivity of the cells. Viability was measured in cells grown in normal culture medium 4 hours after challenge with tert-butylhydroperoxide. In unchallenged conditions, cells over-expressing either IDI-T or IDI-C transcripts showed lower cell viability compared with untransfected cells (data not shown). The transfected cells showed lower viability over a range of tert-butylhydroperoxide concentrations with 40–60% viability when challenged with 1–5 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide. The fall in cell viability after a challenge with 3 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide was significantly greater in cells expressing IDI-C compared with those expressing the IDI-T (p = 0.006, Fig. 1A). One explanation of this effect is that the T and C variant 3′UTRs compete for available Se and selenocysteine incorporation machinery to different extents and so divert Se from synthesis of antioxidant selenoproteins to synthesis of the IDI transgene (which has no antioxidant function) differentially. To test this, measurements of ROS and selenoprotein levels were carried out.<SEP>In order to measure ROS levels following tert-butylhydroperoxide treatment it was necessary to use a lower concentration of the oxidant. Challenge of the cells with 100 μM tert-butylhydroperoxide led to measurable increases in total reactive oxygen species (ROS) after 4 hours but retained cell viability. When IDI-C and IDI-T cells were grown in normal culture medium and challenged with tert-butylhydroperoxide there was a greater increase in levels of ROS in IDI-C cells compared with IDI-T cells (p = 0.053; Fig. 1B) and this difference suggested that the IDI-C cells were under greater oxidative stress. When grown in normal medium the IDI-C cells showed a significantly lower GPx activity compared with the IDI-T cells but levels of TR1 and GPx4 were similar (Fig. 2A). Real-time PCR showed mean levels of TR1, GPx1 and GPx4 mRNAs to be similar in the IDI-T and IDI-C cells but levels of selenoprotein H mRNA were significantly lower in IDI-C cells compared with IDI-T (Fig. 2B).<SEP>To assess the impact of the T/C variants on the selenoprotein hierarchy under conditions of different Se supply, measurements of selenoprotein expression were made in clones grown in Se-depleted and Se-supplemented media. As shown in Fig. 3, in both sets of transfected cells GPx activity, TR1 protein and GPx4 protein levels were 80–90% lower in Se-depleted compared with Se-supplemented cells. Notably the levels, particularly for GPx activity, were similar in cells grown in Se-depleted and cells grown in normal media (DMEM with 10% serum), and we speculate that since GPx1 activity is a sensitive marker of Se status the normal medium used in these experiments was low in Se. In Se-depleted conditions there was no significant difference in GPx activity, TR1 protein or GPx4 protein levels between ID1-C and IDI-T cells. When the cells were grown in Se-supplemented medium the IDI-C cells showed a higher content of GPx4 protein compared with the IDI-T cells (Fig. 3). This suggests that when sufficient Se is present there is a greater increase in GPx4 in IDI-C cells. Real-time PCR showed mean levels of TR1, GPx1 and GPx4 mRNAs to be similar in the IDI-T and IDI-C cells grown in either Se-depleted or supplemented medium but levels of selenoprotein H mRNA were significantly lower in IDI-C cells compared with IDI-T whether the cells were grown in either Se-depleted or supplemented medium (Fig. 3).<SEP>Since selenoprotein expression appeared different in IDI-C and IDI-T cells depending on the Se supply, experiments were carried out to assess how the Se content of the medium affected cell viability following challenge with tert-butylhydroperoxide. In these experiments, where cells were grown under serum-free conditions to deplete Se, cells were more sensitive to the oxidant and so 0.5 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide was used as the challenge. As shown in Fig. 4 in Se-depleted medium IDI-C cells were less viable than the IDI-T cells and this was also the case when a very low concentration of Se (1 nM) was added to the medium. As the Se concentration was increased further there was no difference in viability at 5 nM Se and then at higher concentrations of Se (10–40 nM) the difference in viability was reversed and IDI-C cells showed greater viability than IDI-T after the tert-butylhydroperoxide challenge. These data suggest that when Se supply is low IDI-C cells are under greater oxidative stress than IDI-T cells after a challenge with tert-butylhydroperoxide but that this is not the case when cells are grown in Se supplemented medium when IDI-C cells show greater viability.<SEP>Finally, to exclude the possibility that the observed differences in ROS and selenoprotein expression could have been due to differences in levels of expression of the transgene, effects on single clones were compared. First, ROS levels were measured in IDI-T and IDI-C clones expressing comparable mean IDI transcript levels (0.37 and 0.30, as arbitrary units relative to GAPDH) and exposed to 100 μM tert-butylhydroperoxide. As shown in Fig. 5, mean ROS levels showed a greater increase in the IDI-C clone (2.4-fold) than in IDI-T clones (1.4 fold) and the difference between clone T5 and C4 was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In contrast two IDI-T clones showing a 2-fold difference in IDI expression (0.37 and 0.64, as arbitrary units relative to GAPDH) showed no statistically significant difference in response to tert-butylhydroperoxide. Second, the two IDI-T clones showing differences in IDI expression showed no significant difference in GPx activity whereas the IDI-T and IDI-C clones expressing similar levels of the transgene showed marked difference in mean GPx activity, with the difference between clone C4 and T1 being statistically significant (p = 0.023). These data support those in Figs. 1–3 in indicating that expression of IDI-C has a greater impact on endogenous GPx activity and ROS levels in response to an oxidative challenge.","Discussion<SEP>Previous work has suggested that a T/C variation (rs713041) in the region of the GPX4 gene that corresponds to the 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) of the mRNA has functional consequences. The variants have been shown to lead to transcripts with different protein binding properties, to drive selenoprotein synthesis to different extents and to alter lymphocyte GPx1 and GPx4 expression in vivo. The data from the present work extend these observations suggesting that this SNP is functionally significant by providing evidence that over-expression of transcripts containing the GPX4 3′UTR with either the T (IDI-T) or C (IDI-C) variant leads to altered selenoprotein expression and sensitivity of Caco-2 cells to oxidative challenge and Se-depletion.<SEP>Two observations suggest that the IDI-C cells were more sensitive to an oxidative challenge. First, measurement of ROS levels after challenge with tert-butylhydroperoxide showed a greater increase in IDI-C cells compared with IDI-T cells (Figs. 1B and 5), indicating that the IDI-C cells are under greater oxidative stress. Second, cells expressing the IDI-C variant showed a greater fall in cell viability after a challenge with tert-butylhydroperoxide compared with those expressing the IDI-T. Together these observations indicate that not only are the cells expressing the IDI-C transgene under greater oxidative stress but that the T and C variants at rs713041 in the GPX4 3′UTR have a differential impact on cell function. Furthermore, measurements of viability in cells grown in different Se concentrations showed that the effect of the IDI transgene on cell viability was modulated by Se supply, with IDI-C cells being more susceptible than IDI-T cells to oxidative challenge when Se-depleted but less susceptible when the Se supply was adequate. These data suggest that when Se supply is low IDI-C cells are under greater oxidative stress than IDI-T cells after a challenge with tert-butylhydroperoxide but that this is not the case when cells are grown in Se supplemented medium when IDI-C cells show greater viability. One explanation of these effects is that the T and C variant 3′UTRs compete for available Se and selenocysteine incorporation machinery to different extents and so divert Se for synthesis of the IDI transgene (which has no antioxidant function) differentially. Our hypothesis is that this then alters the balance of expression of endogenous selenoproteins that have redox and antioxidant functions.<SEP>Selenoprotein levels and expression of selenoprotein mRNAs have both been found to respond to Se supply and the effects differ between selenoproteins, leading to the concept of the selenoprotein hierarchy in which the level of selenoproteins and their mRNAs, and mRNA stability, are differentially affected by Se supply. GPx1 synthesis is known to be very sensitive to Se supply and GPx1 is low in the selenoprotein hierarchy in many cell types including Caco-2 cells. In comparison, GPx4 and TR1 are high in the hierarchy and less affected by Se depletion. GPx1, TR1 and GPx4 are key selenoproteins that react with ROS and regulate redox state. SelH mRNA levels are highly sensitive to Se intake in the mouse colon suggesting it is also low in the hierarchy. In the present experiments measurement of GPx1, GPx4, TR1 protein and mRNA levels, as well as SelH mRNA expression, indicated that IDI-C cells have lower expression of two selenoproteins (GPx1 and SelH) that are low in the hierarchy and sensitive to Se supply. This suggests that the T and C variant of the GPX4 3′UTR compete differently in the selenoprotein hierarchy with the C variant competing more strongly.<SEP>The impact of the transgene on selenoprotein expression was affected by Se supply, with GPx activity being lower in IDI-C cells than IDI-T cells when cells were grown in normal medium but this difference was not observed when cells were grown in Se supplemented medium. However, GPx activity was similar in Se-depleted IDI-C and IDI-T cells. The explanation for this is not clear but may reflect an effect of the insulin or transferrin present in the low Se medium compared with that of foetal calf serum in normal medium.<SEP>In addition, IDI-C and IDI-T cells showed similar levels of GPx4 protein when grown in normal or Se-depleted medium but the IDI-C cells had a higher GPx4 level when medium was supplemented with Se. When grown in medium supplemented with Se, IDI-C cells also showed greater cell viability after oxidative challenge and this may be due to the increased GPx4 protein levels in the IDI-C cells. We hypothesise that when the transfected cells are grown in an adequate Se supply, synthesis of selenoproteins high in the hierarchy (e.g. GPx4) is able to compensate for the reduced synthesis of those lower in the hierarchy, such as SelH and GPx1.<SEP>In summary, the present results indicate that expression of transgenes incorporating the T/C variant GPX4 (rs713041) sequences in Caco-2 cells leads to alterations in both cell viability and ROS levels after an oxidative challenge and to changes in selenoprotein expression. Previous work has shown that this T/C variation in the 3′UTR of GPX4 has altered RNA-protein binding properties and an altered ability to promote selenoprotein synthesis. The present findings complement this earlier work by providing further evidence that rs713041 is an SNP with functional consequences and by indicating that its effects include alterations in the pattern of selenoprotein expression. Binding of the different selenoprotein 3′UTRs to proteins involved in selenoprotein synthesis is thought to be a major factor in determining the pattern of selenoprotein synthesis and how this changes with Se supply, so leading to the selenoprotein hierarchy. Further experiments are needed to define how the SNP affects this selenoprotein hierarchy and overall selenoprotein function in the colonic epithelial cell and to define its impact on disease susceptibility.",22784,['VITMIN']
21786365,"Introduction<SEP>Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are heterogeneous disorders in which the safety margin of neuromuscular transmission is compromised by one or more specific mechanisms. The disease proteins are presynaptic, synaptic, or postsynaptic. To date, the CMS have been traced to 10 genes coding for postsynaptic proteins (CHRNA1, CHRNB, CHRND, CHRNE (reviewed by, RAPSN, DOK7, MUSK , SCN4A, GFPT1, PLEC1) and to 3 genes coding for proteins located in the synaptic basal lamina (COLQ, LAMB2, AGRIN) proteins, but only one CMS has been traced to a presynaptic protein, choline acetyltransferase encoded by CHAT (MIM # 118490).<SEP>ChAT (EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes the synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh) by transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) to choline in cholinergic neurons. The enzyme consists of a binding domain and a catalytic domain with an interfacial 16-Å-long active-site tunnel and a key histidine for catalytic activity at the center of the tunnel (Fig. 1). Each domain consists of a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. The affinity for AcCoA is much higher than for choline, and the two-substrate reaction follows sequential kinetics with AcCoA as the leading substrate of the forward reaction. Although cholinergic neurons are widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system, all mutations in CHAT identified to date manifest as CMS. Because the clinical hallmark of the disease is sudden apnea, it was initially referred to as CMS with episodic apnea. In vitro electrophysiology studies of neuromuscular transmission in these patients revealed a progressive decrease of ACh release during subtetanic stimulation followed by prolonged recovery and pointed to CHAT as the candidate gene. During the past decade other disease-associated mutations of CHAT were reported but only the first study by Ohno and coworkers examined the biochemical effects of the mutant enzymes. We here identify 1 nonsense and 12 missense mutation of CHAT in 11 patients. Nine mutations are novel We determine expression of the recombinant mutants, analyze their kinetic properties and thermal stability, and interpret their functional effects in the context of the atomic structural model of human ChAT at 2.2 Å resolution.","Patients, Material and Methods<SEP>Patients<SEP>All human studies described here were in accord with the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of the Mayo Clinic. Eleven patients diagnosed with ChAT deficiency were enrolled in this study. Supp. Table S1 details the clinical features and lists the identified mutations in the 11 patients. Clinical features of Patient 7 and the mutations detected in this laboratory were previously published by. Patients 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 presented with apnea and variable other myasthenic symptoms at birth and five (5, 8, 9, 10, 11) had their first apneic attack or experienced severe respiratory distress during the first 5 months of life. The three most severely affected patients (2, 6, and 7) were permanently ventilator dependent. Life support was withdrawn from Patient 6 at age 10 weeks but Patients 2 and 7 are still alive at 13 and 3 years of age. Patient 4 was born with multiple joint contractures. Three siblings of Patient 6 and one sibling of Patient 3 died suddenly, and one sibling of Patient 3 was stillborn. Ten patients were treated with the cholinergic agonist pyridostigmine; six responded favorably (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10) but the three permanently ventilator dependent patients and patient 11 did not.<SEP>Mutation Analysis<SEP>DNA was isolated from blood by standard methods. We directly sequenced all exons and flanking noncoding regions as well as the unique S, R, N, and M exons of CHAT. Nucleotide numbering reflects cDNA numbering with +1 corresponding to the A of the translation initiation codon ATG of M type CHAT (RefSeq. NM_020549.4) encoding 83 kDa ChAT. Codon numbers start from the translation initiation codon according to the reference sequence NP_065574. We used the 83-kDa human ChAT protein encoded by the M transcript for numbering amino acids because it covers all coding regions of CHAT and allows designation of any mutation in the three open reading frames of the transcript. We searched for the identified mutations in family members by DNA sequencing and in normal controls by allele specific PCR. In Patient 5 and his family members relative quantitation of CHAT exons S, 11 and 17 was performed by a quantitative RT-PCR. The primer sequences are available upon request.<SEP>Construction of Expression Vectors<SEP>We used the S transcripts of CHAT for expression studies because its open reading frame is encoded by all CHAT transcripts, it harbors all identified mutations, and was previously cloned by us from a spinal cord cDNA library predicting it is the transcript used by motor neurons. Construction of the mammalian cell expression vector pRBG4 containing the 74-kDa S-transcript (NM_ 001142933; nucleotides 470-2470) and the bacterial-expression vector pRT7/NT containing the 70-kDa S-transcript (NM_001142934.1; nucleotides 578-2470) of wild-type ChAT were previously described. The identified mutations in CHAT were introduced into both vectors using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent). Presence of desired mutations and absence of unwanted mutations was confirmed by sequencing the entire inserts.<SEP>Protein Expression in Bosc 23 Cells<SEP>Bosc 23 cells were transfected with 1 μg of the long S isoform of wild-type and mutant CHAT cDNA and 1 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega) per 35 mm dish using TransIT-LT1 (Mires Bio) following the manufacturer’s instruction. Bosc 23 cells were extracted 2–3 days after transfection and the cell lysates were immunoblotted as previously described. Plate to plate variations of transfection efficiency were corrected by monitoring the expression of β-galactosidase in the immunoblots.<SEP>Expression and Purification of Recombinant CHAT Expressed in Bacteria<SEP>BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria (Invitrogen) were transformed with wild-type and mutant CHAT cDNA in pCRT7/NT and grown at 37°C in 2 ml LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After an overnight growth, the bacterial lysates were purified on a Ni-agarose column and then further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography. Details of the procedure are shown in Supplemental File 1.<SEP>Measurement of Enzyme Activity and Treatment of Kinetic Data<SEP>ChAT velocity was measured under steady state conditions over a range of choline and AcCoA concentrations in a 36-point assay using the radiochemical method of. We first analyzed the two-substrate ChAT reaction by assuming an ordered random bi-bi mechanism described by the steady state equation.<SEP>  where v is the initial reaction velocity, A corresponds to AcCoA, B to choline, and E to ChAT, kcat represents the turnover number (Vmax/[E]), KiA the dissociation constant for the E-A complex, and KmA and KmB the Michaelis-Menten constants. The initial steps of the reaction are schematically represented by the scheme below,<SEP>and according to the law of equilibrium<SEP>  where KiB is the dissociation constant for the E-B complex.<SEP>Examination of Lineweaver-Burke plots of 1/v as a function of 1/[AcCoA] revealed that for 8 mutations (p.Val136Met, p.Met202Arg, p.Ala235Thr, p.Trp421Ser, p.Ser498Pro, pAla631Thr, p.Ile689Ser, and p.Ser704P) high concentrations of AcCoA inhibited the reaction at low choline concentrations. To correct for this, Equation 1 was modified to allow for the formation of a ChAT-(AcCoA)2 dead-end complex <SEP>  where KiA is the dissociation constant for the E-A complex and KisA the dissociation constant for the dead-end complex. Comparison of the results obtained by Equation 1 and 2 by the F-test on chi-square indicated that the additional term added to the Equation 1 significantly improved the fits except for three mutants (p.Thr553Asn, p.Ala557, and p.Ser572Trp) discussed below.<SEP>The kinetic activities of the p.Thr608Asn mutant were analyzed using Equation 1.<SEP>For the p.Thr553Asn and p.Ala557Thr mutants, the choline concentration obtainable in the reaction system was much lower than KmB. Therefore Equation 1 reduces to<SEP>Similarly, for the p.Ser572Trp mutant the obtainable concentration of AcCoA is much lower than KmA, and Equation 1 reduces to<SEP>Here KiB is substituted for KiAKmB/KmA according to Equation 2..<SEP>Sigmaplot 10 computer program (SPSS, Chicago) and weighted nonlinear regression were used to generate the kinetic constants for each enzyme by fitting the data to the above equations.<SEP>Thermal Denaturation Studies<SEP>Prior to measuring thermal denaturation values, ChAT samples were diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM DTT. Thermal denaturation was monitored by increasing the temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min and measuring the circular dichroism signal at 222 nm with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD) as a function of sample temperature in the range of 10–70 °C. Tm values were determined by fitting thermal denaturation curves to a Boltzmann sigmoid function.","Results<SEP>Mutation Analysis<SEP>We identified 12 missense and one nonsense mutations in CHAT in 11 kinships (Table 1, Fig. 1, and Supp. Figure S1). Nine mutations are novel; p.Thr553Asn and p.Ser704Pro detected in this laboratory were published but not functionally characterized by. p.Ala557Thr was previously reported by. None of the mutations was detected in 200 to 400 alleles of unrelated control subjects. All mutated residues are conserved in dog, mouse, rat, and chicken. Four residues (Met202, Trp421, Thr553, and Ala557) are also conserved in Drosophila and C. elegans.<SEP>p.Val136Met was observed in three patients (2, 6, and 9) and p.Ala557Thr in five (3, 5, 8, 9, and 10). Patient 8 is homozygous for p.Ala557Thr. Patient 5 showed apparent homozygosity for p.Ala557Thr but the mutation was transmitted by the unaffected mother and not carried by the father (see Supp. Figure S1). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed the patient, her father and one brother are hemizygous for CHAT. One unaffected sibling inherited the wild-type allele from both parents; the other unaffected sibling inherited only the maternal wild-type allele (see Supp. Figure S2). p.Ala557Thr also determines the phenotype in patient 10 who carries a nonsense mutation on her second allele. Patient 11, born to consanguineous parents, is homozygous for p.Ile689Ser.<SEP>Expression, Kinetic Properties, and Thermal Stability of Wild-Type and Mutant ChATs<SEP>To examine the expression of the missense mutants at the protein level, we genetically engineered mutant and wild-type CHAT cDNAs into Bosc 23 cells and analyzed immunoblots of cell lysates. The spinal cord (S-type) ChAT transcript has two alternative start sites that yield 70 kDa and 74 kDa proteins at a constant ratio. Eight mutants expressed at significantly lower levels than wild-type, and five of these (p.Trp421Ser, p.Ser498Pro, p.Thr553Asn, p.Ala557Thr, p.Ser572Trp) expressed at <50% of wild-type (Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2).<SEP>To evaluate the kinetic parameters and thermal stability of wild-type and mutant ChATs, we transformed E. coli with histidine-tagged CHAT cDNAs and purified the enzymes recovered from the bacterial cell lysates on a Ni-NTA column followed by fast protein liquid chromatography. Ten mutations alter one or more rate constants of ChAT activation and two mutations compromise the thermal stability of the mutant protein (Tables 1 and 2). The Discussion analyzes the effects of each mutation and interprets them in the context of the atomic structural model of ChAT.","Discussion<SEP>Mutations Lining the Active Site Tunnel<SEP>Four mutations, p.Met202Arg, p.Ala557Thr, p.Glu555X and p.Thr553Asn involve residues that line the active-site tunnel (Fig. 3). p.Glu555X is predicted to abrogate enzyme activity. p.Met202Arg reduces the kcat ~40-fold and the overall catalytic efficiency ~100-fold (Table 2 and Fig. 3A). The mutated methionine is separated only by Tyr203 from the key catalytic His442. Moreover, Met202 along with Tyr203 are on a coil region that connects the binding to the catalytic domain and is subject to conformational change during catalysis. Replacement of the neutral side chain of Met by the longer and basic side chain of Arg likely disrupts the local structure of the active site, including the conformation of the side chain of the catalytic His442, and hinders conformational change during catalysis.<SEP>The p.Thr553Asn and p.Ala557Thr mutants show only slight saturation with AcCoA concentrations and no saturation with choline, indicating an extremely low affinity for AcCoA and choline (Table 2 and Fig. 3A). The mutated residues are in the splayed β sheet 11 that forms part of the active-site tunnel. Their side chains point away from the active-site tunnel but mutation of either residue likely perturbs the local environment by disrupting the conformations of the nearby Tyr554 and Ser558 essential for choline and AcCoA binding.<SEP>Mutation Near the Substrate Binding Site<SEP>p.Ser572Trp dramatically curtails affinity and catalytic efficiency for AcCoA and choline (Table 2). Ser572 is located in the core of the enzyme below the sheet that contains Tyr554 and Ser558 which are directly involved in substrate binding (Fig. 3B). Conversion of Ser to bulky Trp disrupts the core and likely affects positions of these critical residues.<SEP>p.Thr608Asn enhances dissociation of AcCoA from the enzyme complex by 3.5-fold and reduces the overall catalytic efficiency to 39% of wild-type (Table 2). Although Thr608 does not interact with AcCoA directly, it is positioned just below the binding site for the nucleotide portion of CoA (Fig. 4A). It is also 4 Å from Gln262, which interacts with CoA phosphates in the P loop covering the CoA binding site, and is 3.7 Å from Ser530 and 3.3 Å from Thr611 which interact with CoA.<SEP>Mutations Distant from Active or Substrate Binding Sites<SEP>The mutations in this group include p.Trp421Ser and p.Ile689Ser with severe kinetic effects, and p.Val136Met, p.Ala235Thr and p.Thr608Asn with milder kinetic effects..<SEP>Although Trp421 is 19Å from the catalytic His442, the kcat of the mutant enzyme is <1% of wild-type and the dissociation constant of AcCoA from the enzyme-substrate complex is enhanced 4-fold (Table 2). We postulate the structural perturbation caused by the p.Trp421Ser affects the active site allosterically because it is adjacent to Tyr422 which is only 3.3 Å from Glu441 that links to His442 (Fig. 4B). The side chain of Trp421 points into hydrophobic/aromatic core of the enzyme and accepts a hydrogen bond from the nearby γ-oxygen of Tyr280. Also, the serine replacing Trp421 cannot make the hydrogen bond nor fill the pocket left by tryptophan. This may alter folding and account for the reduced expression of the mutant enzyme.<SEP>Ile689 is 18 Å from the catalytic His442 but p.Ile689Ser reduces kcat to 27% of wild-type (Table 2). Ile689 is at the beginning of β strand 16 which is antiparallel to β strand 15 (Fig. 4C). The side chain of Ile689 extends into hydrophobic core, and replacement of Ile689 by Ser likely disrupts the packing locally. We postulate the mutation exerts its effect by altering positioning of β strand 16 that forms one side of the active site cavity. Beta strand 16 is linked by a bridge between Cys692 to Cys681 on antiparallel β strand 15, or with Cys668 on β strand 14, and both residues are in the cluster of cysteine residues involved in the formation of the active complex. Thus a small change in positioning of β strand 16 likely affects alignment of the bound substrates relative to the catalytic histidine residue and thereby the catalytic rate.<SEP>The p.Val136Met mutant has a Tm is 2°C lower than wild-type, indicating a mild decrease in thermal stability. Val136 is close to the N-terminal end of ChAT and remote from substrate binding or catalytic sites. However, the mutation enhances dissociation of AcCoA from the enzyme complex and thereby reduces the overall catalytic efficiency of ChAT to ~25% of wild-type (Table 2). A plausible explanation for this would be an energetic link between Val136 and residues contributing to the AcCoA binding site via Val136-Trp193-Asn622-Val567-Ser558 with interresidue distances ranging from 3.4 to 4.4 Å (Fig. 5A).<SEP>p.Ala235Thr is in α helix 7 and 25 Å from the catalytic His442 (Fig. 5B). The mutation has only a slight effect on thermal stability but decreases the kcat to 43%, and the overall catalytic efficiency to ~45%, of wild-type (Table 2). Ala235 is 4.2 Å from Val430 on β strand 7 which is antiparallel to β strand 8 that connects to His442. Replacement of neutral Ala235 by the larger and polar Thr likely displaces the antiparallel β strands and consequently His442.<SEP>p.Ala631Thr reduces expression, affinity for AcCoA, and overall catalytic efficiency of ChAT to 70% of wild-type. Ala631 is 27 Å from the active site and a path to the active site is not apparent. A possible explanation for the observed kinetic effects would be altered folding of the mutant enzyme but its Tm is unaltered.<SEP>Mutations Affecting the Thermal Stability of ChAT<SEP>This group includes two mutations that introduce a Pro residue into an α helix. p.Ser498Pro is 23 Å from the active site. It expresses at ~30% of wild-type and decreases kcat to ~70% of wild-type (Table 2). In addition, Ser498 is in α helix 15 which is only 2.9 Å from Asp356 that links α helix 10 to 11 (Fig. 6A), predicting an effect on the stability of ChAT, and thermal denaturation studies reveal a large decrease in Tm relative to wild-type (Table 2 and Fig. 6C).<SEP>p.Ser704Pro is 18 Å from the active site. It is located at the beginning of α helix 24 and its side chain forms a hydrogen bond with Ser695 in β strand 16 (Fig. 6B). The mutation does not significantly change the expression or kinetic properties of ChAT but its position in an α helix predicts an effect on the folding or thermal stability of ChAT. We confirmed this by thermal denaturation studies that reveal a large decrease in Tm relative to wild-type (Table 2 and Fig. 6C).<SEP>Genotype-Phenotype Correlations<SEP>Genotype-phenotype correlations are hindered in patients with biallelic mutations. However, it is noteworthy that the most severely affected Patients (2, 6, and 7) with life-long apnea and severe weakness refractory to pyridostigmine harbor one mutation near the active-site of the enzyme (p.Ser572Trp, p.Met202Arg, and p.Thr553Asn) (Fig. 3A). The second mutation in Patients 2 and 6, p.Val136Met, expresses at <50% of wild-type and reduces the overall catalytic efficiency of the enzyme to 24% (Table 2). The second mutation in Patient 7, p.Ser704Pro, renders the enzyme conformationally unstable (Fig. 6B and C).<SEP>Patient 1 is heterozygous for p.Thr421Ser (Fig. 4B) and p.Ala631Thr. The p.Thr421Ser mutation reduces the kcat of the enzyme to <1% of wild-type; therefore p.Ala631Thr, which reduces the expression and overall catalytic efficiency to ~70 % of wild-type, dominates the clinical phenotype (Table 2). The patient was severely affected as an infant but responded well to pyridostigmine.<SEP>The p.Ile689Ser mutation also has severe kinetic consequences (Fig. 4C). Patient 11 is homozygous for this mutation and is severely affected; he is refractory to pyridostigmine and has frequent episodes of hypoventilation. On the other hand, Patients 5, 8, and 10 whose phenotype is determined by the p.Ala557Thr mutation, which is also near the active site, are less severely affected and remain responsive to pyridostigmine.<SEP>Clinical Implications<SEP>Among the genetically distinct CMSs identified to date, ChAT-CMS is one of the most disabling and lethal. Five of the 11 patients in our series did not respond or responded poorly to pyridostigmine, while in five similar treatment was beneficial. Therefore a trial of cholinesterase inhibitors must be part of the initial management of all CMS-ChAT patients.<SEP>The permanent paralysis and refractoriness to therapy of the three most severely affected patients indicates that the amount of ACh released from the nerve terminal during activity generates endplate potentials subthreshold for triggering propagated action potentials even when cholinesterase inhibition by pyridostigmine prolongs the lifetime of ACh in the synaptic space.<SEP>Other types of CMS can also be highly disabling. These include endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency caused by mutations in COLQ, fast-channel mutations of AChR subunits that severely impede gating, and low-expressor or null mutations of both alleles of CHRNA1, CHRNB, CHRND coding for non-ε subunits of AChR as well as defects in rapsyn encoded by RAPSN and in Nav1.4 encoded by SCN4A. However, if correctly diagnosed, these CMS can be at least partially improved by pharmacotherapy.",20986,['VITMIN']
27884142,"Background<SEP>CVD is the most common cause of death globally. Risk factors of CVD include high blood pressure, smoking, hyperglycaemia, T2D and obesity. Previous studies have suggested that increased oxidative stress as a consequence of obesity and T2D may contribute to the increased risk of CVD. Furthermore, CVD and risk factors of CVD have been associated with changes in levels of oxidative stress markers.<SEP>Some of the oxidative markers have also been associated with sub-phenotypes of CVD and T2D. For example, oxLDL, elevated in CVD, plays a role in atherosclerosis through its role in maturation of macrophages contributing to inflammation and foam formation. Furthermore, oxLDL is associated with insulin resistance indicating a role of oxidative stress in progression to insulin resistance and T2D. The amino acid HCY has been associated with inflammation in blood vessels, progression to atherosclerosis and development of CVD, particularly ischemic stroke; however, the causal role of homocysteine has been challenged.<SEP>While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying numerous common genetic sequence variants associated with metabolic disease and CVD, so far these only explain a small proportion of the variability of these phenotypes. In addition, environmental factors also influence disease susceptibility. Such contributions may be partly mediated through changes in epigenetic marks (e.g. DNA methylation), affecting transcription through mechanisms independent of DNA sequence. Thus, studies relating differential methylation with intermediate phenotypes and disease endpoints may be useful in identifying additional candidate genes and mechanisms involved in these diseases. Previous studies support a role for DNA methylation in common complex diseases and in mediation of environmental exposures of importance for CVD and T2D, such as cigarette smoking and oxidative stress.<SEP>In this study, we aimed to examine epigenetic variation in blood cells in relation to oxidative stress and development of T2D and CVD. Blood-derived cells play a role in several processes relating to cardiometabolic disease. Furthermore, previous studies have shown methylation variation in blood to reflect differential methylation in various tissues. We performed analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation, ten markers of oxidative stress (TGSH, GSH, GSSG, GSSG/GSH ratio, HCY, oxLDL, OLAB, CD, BCD-LDL and TAOC) and incident disease in 966 individuals from the general population.","Methods<SEP>Study sample<SEP>The Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) is a prospective community-based cohort of participants from Uppsala, Sweden. All men and women at age 70 living in Uppsala in 2001 were invited to participate. The 1016 participants (50% women) have been extensively phenotyped, as described previously, and on the Internet (www.medsci.uu.se/pivus/). The participants have been re-examined at ages 75 and 80, and their morbidity and mortality has been followed via national registers and journal review. Clinical diagnoses by journal review of CVD and/or T2D at 80 years (10 years after baseline) were used to define disease events. For analysis of CVD outcomes, we included myocardial infarction (ICD-10 code: I21), stroke (ICD-10 code:I63) and heart failure (ICD-10 code: I50). During the 10 year follow up period (between ages 70 and 80), there were 142 deaths; 34 of these due to CVD related disease.<SEP>Markers of oxidative stress<SEP>The methods of collection and validation of oxidative markers have previously been described. Briefly, TGSH, GSH, CD and TAOC were determined using a method described and validated in Annuk et al.. HCY levels were measured using an Enzyme Immunoassay method (Axis-Shield Diagnostics Ltd, UK). BCD-LDL were measured using a method described in detail in. Enzyme-linked immuno-absorbent assays were used to determine levels of serum oxLDL (Mercodia AB, Sweden) and OLAB (BioMedica, Austria).<SEP>Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling<SEP>Blood for the DNA methylation assay was collected at the baseline examination. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples and bisulphite conversion of 500 ng genomic DNA was performed using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation Gold Kit (Zymo Research Product, Germany). The equivalent of approximately 200 ng of bisulphite converted DNA was removed, evaporated to a volume of < 4 μl, and used for methylation profiling using the Illumina Infinium assay and the Illumina HumanMethylation450_v.1.2 bead chip according to the protocol from the supplier (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The results were analysed with GenomeStudio 2011.1 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). After exclusion of replicates, a total of 1002 study participants had methylation data available for quality control procedures. Three samples were excluded based on poor bisulphite conversion efficiency, twelve samples due to low pass rate of CpG sites (<98.5% with a detection P-value > 0.01) and a further six samples based on low SNP genotype match (>1 SNP mismatches) between genotypes from the methylation array and Omni/Metabochip genotyping chips leaving 981 samples. Following additional removal of participants with high leukocyte cell counts (>10x109 cells/L; n = 14) and one individual with no data on oxidative stress markers, 966 individuals remained for downstream analysis. The signal intensities for the methylated and unmethylated states were then quantile normalised for each probe type separately, and beta values were calculated. Mapping and annotation of the 485,764 probes on the HumanMethylation450K BeadChip has previously been described. Briefly, probes mapping to multiple locations (with at least two mismatches) in the human reference genome (GRCh37) were excluded leaving 459,433 uniquely mapping autosomal probes. Furthermore, probes were filtered based on sequence polymorphisms as follows: those with a common SNP (minor allele frequency [MAF] > 5%) within 10 bp of the methylation site and those overlapping copy number variants were excluded from analysis. This resulted in a final set of 455,127 probes which were then assigned to CpG islands and RefSeq transcripts downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (September, 2012). Probes within 2 kb away from borders of a CpG island were defined as shores and those within 2 kb of shores as falling within shelves. The rest were assigned to others/open sea. Probes were mapped in relation to transcripts as follows: TSS1500 (1500 bp to 200 bp upstream of transcriptional start site [TSS]), TSS200 (200 bp upstream of TSS), the 5'-UTR, the first exon, the gene body or the 3'-UTR.<SEP>Genotyping and imputation<SEP>Individuals were genotyped using the Illumina OmniExpress and Illumina Metabochip microarrays. Prior to imputation, quality control was performed as described below. Exclusion of samples were performed based on the following criteria: genotype call rate <95%; heterozygosity >3 standard deviations (SD); gender discordance; duplicated samples; identity-by-descent match; and ethnic outliers. Monomorphic SNPs; or SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value < 1E10-6; genotype call rate < 0.99 (SNPs with MAF <5%) or <0.95 (SNPs with MAF ≥ 5%); MAF < 1% were excluded from analysis. Data were imputed to the 1000G (version: March 2012) multi population reference panel using Impute v.2.2.2. A plot of the PIVUS data with the data from the multi - population reference panel are included in Additional file 1: Figure S1.<SEP>Statistical analyses<SEP>Association of methylation of blood cell-derived DNA with phenotypes and disease outcomes<SEP>Transformed or raw phenotypes were used (details in Table 1). All models were adjusted for age, sex, batching (clinical visit date), bisulphite conversion efficiency mean (calculated from control probes), bisulphite conversion plate and predicted white cell counts (estimated from the DNA methylation data using the Houseman algorithm, as implemented in R package minfi for Illumina HumanMethylation450, with reference data on sorted blood cell populations from Reinius et al.). To determine whether BMI confounds the relationship between the oxidative marker and DNA methylation, we performed secondary models additionally adjusted for BMI for those oxidative markers that showed association with BMI in sex adjusted models (nominal p-value < 0.01). For continuous phenotypes, the associations between normalised DNA methylation beta values and phenotypes were modelled by a linear model, using R and the lm function, fitted by maximum-likelihood assuming a normally distributed error term. For binary phenotypes (case/control), we fitted a logistic regression in R using the glm function (binomial family [link function, logit]), to model the association between standardised DNA methylation and case/control status. Disease was used as the outcome variable, and technical covariates (as above), age, sex, predicted white cell count and standardised methylation as independent variables as follows: Disease status (1/0) ~ standardised methylation + age + sex + predicted white cell counts + technical covariates. In secondary models, we also included BMI and smoking as covariates in the model. In all cases, a likelihood ratio test was used to assess the significance of the phenotype effect. The p-value of the phenotype effect in each model was calculated from the Chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom using -2log(likelihood ratio) as the test statistic. FDR were estimated based on Q-values. For CVD and T2D outcomes, significance was assessed using permutations of case/control status (10,000 permutations). A permutation p-value of < 0.01 was considered as significant. <SEP>meQTL and SNP-phenotype analyses<SEP>Associations between normalised DNA methylation beta values and genotypes were modelled by a linear model, using R and the lm function, fitted by maximum-likelihood assuming a normally distributed error term. We assumed an additive genetic model. A likelihood ratio test was used to assess the significance of the SNP effect. The p-value of the SNP effect in each model was calculated from the Chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom using -2log(likelihood ratio) as the test statistic. We only performed cis analysis, which was limited to SNPs located within 100 kb either side of the probe location. To perform analyses in R, genotype probabilities (from IMPUTE) were transformed to posterior mean genotypes (MACH format). Further, we only included SNPs with a MAF <5% and INFO (from imputation) >0.8 in down-stream analyses. Since we did not perform a array-wide cis-meQTL scan, and were therefore concerned of potential bias in the p-value distribution, we estimated FDR from permutations, rather than using Q-values. We permuted SNP data, performed cis-meQTL analysis on the permuted data, and repeated this for ten replicates selecting the most associated SNP per methylation probe in each round of permutation. FDR of 0.05 was calculated as the nominal p-value threshold which gave less than 5% significant associations (i.e. false discoveries) in the permuted data. Associations between oxidative markers and meQTL genotypes were modelled by a linear model, using R and the lm function, fitted by maximum-likelihood assuming a normally distributed error term. We assumed an additive genetic model. A likelihood ratio test was used to assess the significance of the SNP effect. The p-value of the SNP effect in each model was calculated from the Chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom using -2log(likelihood ratio) as the test statistic. Significance was assessed using permutations of genotype data (10,000 permutations). Using a one-sided Fisher exact test we tested for over representation of significant meQTL SNPs in nominally significant GWAS associations (p-value < 0.05) using GWAS data from the CARDIoGRAM consortium for CHD and the DIAGRAM consortium for T2D.<SEP>Enrichment in genomic location, regulatory regions, transcription factor binding and biological processes<SEP>Using annotation data described above we tested whether CpGs associated with oxidative markers were enriched in genomic locations with respect to genes and CpG islands. Enrichment was assessed using a two-sided Fisher exact test. Overlap of associated CpGs with functional regulatory elements across cell types were assessed using data available at RegulomeDB. We determined if the overlap was more than expected by chance by comparing this to random set of CpGs. To assess whether genes annotated to phenotype-associated CpGs are likely to be regulated by a common set of transcription factors (TFs), we utilised PSCAN with the JASPAR database. To place our data in the context of biological processes or pathways, we subjected genes annotated to CpGs associated with phenotypes or genotypes to pathway analysis using DAVID and PANTHER. We used only genes on the array as background and considered terms with a p-value < 0.05 following adjustments for multiple testing (to the number of pathways or ontology terms) as significant.","Results<SEP>Identification of DNA methylation patterns of oxidative stress<SEP>We characterised genome-wide blood DNA methylation patterns at 459,235 CpGs mapping uniquely across the genome in 966 70-year old individuals from the PIVUS cohort. We performed genome-wide association scans to determine DNA methylation patterns associated with ten markers of oxidative stress: TGSH, GSH, GSSG, GSSG/GSH ratio, HCY, oxLDL, OLAB, CD, BCD-LDL and TAOC (Table 1). In total, we observed 66 CpGs for which levels of methylation were associated with one or more oxidative markers at a-per-trait FDR of <0.05; 18 of these were also associated with at least one oxidative marker at a Bonferroni-corrected alpha threshold <0.05 (taking the number of CpGs into account; ﻿Additional file 2: Figure S2). Figure 1 shows the associations of CpGs with oxidative stress markers. <SEP>Glutathione<SEP>Glutathione is an important antioxidant and the balance between the reduced and oxidised form is indicative of the oxidative state of an individual. We investigated the association between genome-wide methylation patterns and TGSH, GSH and GSSG and found 18, 25 and one significant CpGs, respectively (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S1–S3). As should be expected, a large proportion of CpGs associated with TGSH and GSH was shared (14 CpGs; Fig. 1), including sites annotated to BCL2L11 (cg07547695; BCL2-like 11 [apoptosis facilitator]), NDUFS7 (cg19054833; NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] Fe-S protein 7, 20 kDa) and EIF3J (cg08637583; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit J). The ratio of GSSG to GSH can be used as a marker of oxidative stress. We found methylation at 21 CpGs to be significantly associated with GSSG/GSH ratio (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S4). Methylation in the promoter region of ZNF761 (cg02892660; zinc finger protein 761) and PSMG3 (cg23970891; proteasome assembly chaperone 3), showed the strongest associations with GSSG/GSH ratio.<SEP>Homocysteine<SEP>In our analysis, methylation at nine CpGs were significantly associated with levels of the amino acid HCY (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S5), including sites annotated to genes with a role in signal transduction (ENTHD1 [cg00044729], LRIG1[cg25230917], RIPK3 [cg13796295], RPS6KC1 [cg10578681], ATP2B4 [cg17850539]) and lipid-related processes (RPS6KC1 [cg10578681]).<SEP>Lipid-related oxidative markers<SEP>In genome-wide methylation analysis, oxLDL was associated with methylation in the 5'-UTR of SEMA6A (cg06650664; sema domain, transmembrane domain [TM], and cytoplasmic domain, [semaphorin] 6A), a protein with anti-angiogenic function (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S6). Oxidation of LDL can also be monitored by markers CD and BCD-LDL which measure products of lipid peroxidation. In our analysis, CD was found to associate with higher methylation at a CpG site located in the 3'-UTR of TAPBP (cg09899712; TAP binding protein [tapasin]) and the promoter region (TSS1500) of RGL2 (cg09899712; ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator-like 2 (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S7). Methylation levels at six CpGs were associated with BCD-LDL (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S8). These were annotated to CKAP5 (cg09822824; cytoskeleton associated protein 5), FOSL2 (cg11133114; FOS-like antigen 2), FAM20C (cg21913519, cg05969038; family with sequence similarity 20, member C) and FRMD6 (cg18894781; FERM Domain containing 6). We observed no overlap in significant CpGs between the three lipid-related oxidative markers. As CD (p-value = 0.00011) and BCD-LDL (p-value = 0.0091) were found to be associated with BMI in sex-adjusted models in our study, secondary models adjusted for BMI were also performed for these two phenotypes (Additional file 3: Tables S7–S8). None of the phenotype-associated CpGs showed a large change in the regression coefficient for the oxidative marker after adjustment with BMI, indicating that BMI did not confound the relationship between DNA methylation and these oxidative markers (Additional file 1: Figure S3).<SEP>Functional characterisation of methylation sites associated with oxidative stress<SEP>We explored the functional role of CpGs associated with oxidative markers through investigation of their genomic location with respect to genes, CpG islands and functional regulatory elements. Phenotype-associated CpGs were enriched in CpG island shores compared to all CpGs on the array (enrichment p-value = 0.04, Fig. 2). A larger proportion of phenotype-associated CpGs (as compared to all CpGs) were located in promoters of genes (45% vs. 36%; enrichment p-value = 0.06, Fig. 3); thus having the potential to affect transcription from adjacent genes. We assessed the overlap of associated CpGs with functional regulatory elements across cell types using RegulomeDB. Twenty-three percentages of sites showed strong evidence of being located in a functional regulatory region (RegulomeDB score 1a-2c; Additional file 3: Tables S1–S8). This was more than expected by chance (permutation p-value = 0.01).  <SEP>To assess whether genes annotated to phenotype-associated CpGs are likely to be regulated by a common set of TFs, we used PSCAN with the JASPAR database. We found significant enrichment of four TF binding sites (adjusted p-value <0.05; Additional file 1: Table S9), including binding sites of E2F1, a gene/protein with a potential role in atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD).<SEP>To further place our findings in biological context, we performed gene set enrichment analysis on the 64 genes annotated to CpGs associated with oxidative markers. Using the Functional Annotation Clustering Tool in DAVID, we found evidence of genes clustering into annotations (enrichment score > 1) relating to functional terms phosphorylation and phosphate/phosphorous metabolic processes and pleckstrin domains (Additional file 1: Table S11).<SEP>Genetic associations of oxidative stress-associated DNA methylation<SEP>Genetic sequence variants have been shown to contribute to DNA methylation variation, so called meQTLs. We examined the presence of such loci for the 66 CpGs associated with oxidative markers, and found 28 (41.8%) of phenotype-CpGs with a significant cis-meQTL (FDR < 0.05, nominal p-value <2.07E-4, Additional file 1: Table S12). To assess whether genetic associations with markers of oxidative stress may be mediated by epigenetics, we examined whether genotype-phenotype, genotype-CpG and CpG-phenotype associations overlapped (an overview of the analysis are available in Additional file 4: Figure S4). Overall, we investigated whether cis-meQTL SNPs associated with the oxidative markers and found modest suggestive evidence of association (p-value <0.001) for 171 SNPs (0.56%) with at least one of the oxidative markers. We found two instances (at cg07547695 in the 5'-UTR of BCL2L11, associated with both TGSH and GSH) for which associations of genotype-phenotype (p-value <0.001), cis-meQTL (FDR < 0.05) and CpG-phenotype (FDR < 0.05) overlapped (Additional file 1: Table S13; Additional file 4: Figure S4). A proxy of rs6750142 (rs726430, r 2 = 1) associated with methylation at cg07547695 was nominally associated (p-value <0.05) with both CHD and T2D in GWAS.<SEP>We investigated the behaviour of 1599 significant meQTL SNPs (FDR < 0.05) in GWAS data from the CARDIoGRAM consortium for CHD and the DIAGRAM consortium for T2D. We found no evidence of overrepresentation of nominally significant associations (p-value <0.05) for CHD (one-sided Fisher exact p-value = 0.99) or T2D (one-sided Fisher exact p-value = 0.93) among significant meQTL SNPs. One or more significant meQTL SNPs of nine CpG sites were nominally associated with CHD in GWAS data from the CARDIoGRAM consortium (p-value < 0.05). These were annotated to AMDHD1 (cg15351688: rs10777751, rs7955450, rs7486703), BCL2L11 (cg07547695: rs726430), FAM20C (cg05969038: rs7786461; cg21913519: rs7786461), HSP90AB1 (cg26241416: rs6905285, rs7758726, rs666462), SEMA6A (cg06650664: rs10077506, rs17139825), WNK2 (cg14396800: rs2991377,rs10992689, rs10821105) and intergenic sites on chr. 5 (cg15609272: rs17057846) and chr. 12 (cg17173663: rs1354156) (Additional file 5). In analogous analysis on GWAS data from the DIAGRAM consortium, we found nominal associations for SNPs associated with methylation at CpG sites annotated to BCL2L11 (cg07547695: rs726430), CEP55 (cg24371383: rs12782691), CPB1 (cg04072156: rs16861015) and an intergenic site on chr. 4 (cg14532755: rs1665364, rs2236786, rs3752749, rs732754, rs744658, rs798719, rs798726, rs798727, rs798741, rs798744, rs798751, rs798754, rs798755, rs798756, rs798766, rs811316, rs8389) (p-value < 0.05; Additional file 5).<SEP>The relationship between oxidative stress-associated CpGs and disease incidence<SEP>As markers of oxidative stress have been associated with both CVD and T2D, we sought to assess the role of epigenetics in this process. Methylation levels at the 66 CpGs associated with oxidative markers were tested for association with incident CVD (n = 180) and T2D (n = 71) events during a 10-year follow-up using logistic regression models to examine their potential role in disease. Epigenetic variation in the 3'-UTR of HIST1H4D (cg08170869; histone cluster 1, H4d) and in the body of DVL1 (cg03465880; dishevelled-1) were associated with incident T2D (permutation p-value <0.01; Table 2). For every SD decrease in methylation β value at cg08170869, the risk of T2D was 39% higher (nominal p-value = 0.0034; permutation p-value = 0.0044; odds ratio [OR] per SD decrement = 1.39 [95% CI, 1.15–1.57]). Similarly, hypomethylation in DVL1 was associated with higher risk of T2D (nominal p-value = 0.0073; permutation p-value = 0.0080; OR per SD decrement = 1.31 [95% CI, 1.10–1.47]). <SEP>Analogous analysis of CVD revealed no significant association of methylation levels at the phenotype-associated CpGs with incident CVD events (permutation p-value <0.01). The strongest association was to methylation levels at cg11842944 in the body of ZNF341 (nominal p-value = 0.013; permutation p-value = 0.016; OR per SD decrement = 1.23 [95% CI, 1.05–1.42]). Analysing myocardial infarction (n = 55), heart failure (n = 76) and ischaemic stroke (n = 47) separately, methylation at this CpG showed the strongest association to heart failure (nominal p-value = 0.0087; permutation p-value = 0.0126; OR per SD decrement = 1.28 [95% CI, 1.06–1.50]). This gene lies in a region previously associated with height in GWAS and encodes a gene product involved in transcriptional regulation.","Discussion<SEP>Oxidative stress has previously been associated with development of cardiometabolic disease. In this study, the role of epigenetic changes in blood cells for oxidative stress and development of CVD and T2D was examined through analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation data and ten markers of oxidative stress, CVD and T2D in up to 966 individuals of the same age.<SEP>We identified numerous blood CpGs for which levels of methylation correlated with markers of oxidative stress. Enrichment of associations to DNA methylation in CpG island shores, previously noted to be dynamic and correlated with gene expression, indicates that differential methylation with oxidative stress may play a role in transcriptional regulation. Overlap with functional regulatory elements for one-fourth of associated CpGs support a functional role for these methylation changes with oxidative stress. Enrichment of TF binding sites in regions upstream of genes annotated to phenotype-associated CpGs indicates a common set of regulatory signals. TFs included E2F1 with prior evidence of a function in processes relating to atherosclerosis and CHD, connecting genes for which CpG methylation changed with oxidative stress to CVD.<SEP>Methylation variation in the 3'-UTR of HIST1H4D (cg08170869) and in the body of DVL1 (cg03465880) associated with GSH were also associated with incident T2D. Previous evidence indicates changes in levels of GSH in individuals with T2D. Evidence from previous studies implicates DVL1 in processes related to T2D. DVL1 encodes a gene product with an important role in Wnt signalling, important in adipogeneis, and has, for example, been found to be down-regulated in adipocytes from non-obese insulin resistant individuals compared to controls.<SEP>Roughly forty percent of oxidative stress-associated CpGs were regulated by genetic sequence variation in cis. We found evidence of genotype-phenotype associations acting via epigenetic variation at gene BCL2L11 (BCL2-like 11 [apoptosis facilitator]). Genetic variants close to this gene have previously been associated with the biological ageing marker dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate in GWAS. Integration of meQTLs with GWAS data on CHD and T2D showed no significant enrichment in nominal associations for meQTL SNPs of oxidative stress-associated CpGs.<SEP>Previous evidence indicates a role for some of the genes annotated to oxidative stress marker-associated CpGs in metabolic or cardiovascular disease, indicating that epigenetic changes with oxidative stress may reflect important disease processes. Lipid-related oxidative markers such as oxLDL has previously been shown to play a role in atherosclerosis and to associate with insulin resistance. In agreement with this, we found methylation at genes involved in some of these processes to associate with lipid-related oxidative markers. RGL2 (for which promoter methylation was higher with higher CD) has been shown to have a protective role in response to cardiac stress in vitro. Furthermore, previous results implicate RGL2 in atherosclerosis pathogenesis. RGL2 in complex with SAMD9 have an inhibitory function on expression of the transcription factor EGR1, which is highly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions and has been shown to be involved in induction of the coagulation protein tissue factor in response to oxLDL. Earlier studies suggest a role of the transcription factor FOSL2 (for which intragenic methylation was higher with BCD-LDL) in processes relating to cardiac fibrosis of ischaemic tissue through its oxygen-sensitive induction of TGFβ in cardiac fibroblasts. FOSL2 also regulates leptin expression in adipocytes. The association of BCD-LDL to promoter methylation of this gene in blood was not driven by obesity as the signal still remained following adjustment for BMI. Additionally, genetic studies of QRS duration, which has been associated with increased risk of heart failure, indicate a role of LRIG1. In our study, methylation at this gene associated with HCY, an amino acid previously associated with inflammation in blood vessels, progression to atherosclerosis and development of CVD, particularly ischemic stroke. However, the causal role of homocysteine in CVD has been challenged.<SEP>The main strengths of the present study include the large sample size that underwent measurements of genome-wide DNA methylation, ten markers of reflecting different aspects of oxidative stress and the 10 years of follow-up allowing analyses of incident disease endpoints. The study also has some limitations. First, we acknowledge that the most important limitation is the lack of replication of oxidative stress-associated DNA methylation. To our knowledge, there are no other study samples with the needed data available making replication impossible, but we have done our best to avoid false positive findings via strict correction for multiple testing and integration with data on gene function, regulation and on related phenotypes from external data sources. Second, gene expression data for the same individuals were not available to assess the effect of epigenetic variation with oxidative markers on transcription in blood. Third, while blood is easily accessible and thus attractive for biomarker discovery, clinical diagnostics and translation, blood derived cells may not be the most relevant tissue for drawing biological conclusions about oxidative stress, CVD and T2D. However, previous studies have shown methylation variation in blood to be a good proxy of differential methylation in various tissues.",29314,['VITMIN']
23631824,"1. Introduction<SEP>Disorders of mitochondrial dysfunction, a group of disorders that display both clinical and genetic heterogeneities, develop as a result of dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and can be caused by mutations in any of over 900 genes in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Most mitochondrial diseases involve multiple organ systems and may present with prominent neurologic and myopathic phenotypes, some of which can present as life threatening medical crises. Mitochondrial disorders are commonly classified as clinical syndromes based upon characteristic constellations of clinical features. For example, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS, OMIM #540000) is a separate syndrome from myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF, #545000). Other kindred conditions are Kearns–Sayre syndrome (KSS, OMIM #530000), and Leigh syndrome (LS, OMIM #256000). However, due to significant clinical variability many individuals do not fit perfectly into one particular syndrome. Frequent features of mitochondrial disease are diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, proximal myopathy, ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, sensorineural deafness, optic atrophy, pigmentary retinopathy and can exhibit central nervous system manifestations including seizures, encephalopathy, stroke-like episodes, ataxia, and spasticity.<SEP>Mitochondrial disorders may be caused by defects of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) or nuclear genome. mtDNA mutations are transmitted by maternal inheritance, whereas, nuclear gene mutations may be inherited in an autosomal recessive, dominant or X-linked manner. The mitochondrial genome is a circular double stranded DNA of ~16,569 nucleotides that has 37 genes, encoding 13 essential subunits of the respiratory chain, 22 transfer RNAs, and 2 ribosomal RNAs. Each human cell contains hundreds to thousands of copies of mtDNA. While most individuals carry identical copies of mtDNA (homoplasmy), some inherit more than one mtDNA type from their mother (heteroplasmy) and others may develop heteroplasmy secondary to a new mutation within the mtDNA. The ratio of heteroplasmic mtDNA types can vary among individuals within the same maternal lineage, and also among organs and tissues within the same individual. At least 77 nuclear genes have been linked to mitochondrial diseases, but over 1000 genes are implicated in mitochondrial function, many of which may also cause clinical manifestations if defective. Overall, a conservative estimate for the prevalence of all mitochondrial diseases is 1 in 5000 live births.<SEP>Given the clinical variability and large number of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes in which mutations can occur and result in disease make specific diagnoses of mitochondrial diseases at the molecular level challenging. Any possible inheritance pattern is possible, including autosomal dominant, recessive, X-linked, mitochondrial (maternal) or sporadic. In addition, there is pleiotropy, with the same mutation potentially exhibiting diverse phenotypes in different individuals, even within the same family. An ideal test for mitochondrial disease would include testing both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes concurrently. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recently released a policy statement that stated whole exome and genome sequencing should be considered in the clinical diagnostic assessment of patients when the disorder has a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. Clearly, mitochondrial diseases fit this description. Accordingly, we report the use of exome sequencing using a commercially available exome kit without specific enrichment or amplification of the mtDNA to definitively diagnose one patient with Leigh syndrome (LS, OMIM #256000), two siblings with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (OMIM #252010), and one patient with coenzyme Q10 deficiency (OMIM #607426). In each of the cases presented herein, conventional molecular testing had failed to produce a molecular diagnosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to detect both homoplasmic and heteroplasmic variants in the mitochondrial genome from exome sequencing without specifically targeting the mtDNA.","5. Methods<SEP>5.1. Consent<SEP>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Children's Mercy Hospital (CMH). Informed written consent was obtained from all adult subjects and parents of living children.<SEP>5.2. Targeted exome sequencing<SEP>The Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine (CPGM) at CMH performed exome sequencing on a research basis. Isolated genomic DNA was prepared for sequencing using the Kapa Biosystems library preparation kit and 8 cycles of PCR amplification. Exome enrichment was conducted with the Illumina TruSeq Exome v1 kit (62.2 megabases) following a slightly modified version of the manufacturer recommended protocol. The enrichment protocol was modified to use the Kapa Biosystems PCR amplification kit for the post-enrichment amplification step to limit polymerase induced GC-bias. Successful enrichment was verified by qPCR of 4 targeted loci and 2 nontargeted loci of the sequencing library pre- and post-enrichment prior to sequencing. The enriched library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 using v3 reagents and 1 × 101 basepair sequencing reads.<SEP>5.3. Next generation sequencing analysis<SEP>Sequence data was generated with Illumina RTA 1.12.4.2 & CASAVA-1.8.2, aligned to the human reference NCBI 37 using GSNAP and variants were detected and genotyped using GATK. The GATK Unified Genotyper discards reads with a low mapping quality score so that only reads that aligned unambiguously to a single place in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome were kept and analyzed. We have previously reported a high concordance of variants detected with GSNAP/GATK and those detected using BWA/GATK. Sequence analysis employed FASTQ files, the compressed binary version of the Sequence Alignment/Map format (bam, a representation of nucleotide sequence alignments) and Variant Call Format (VCF, a format for nucleotide variants). Variants were characterized with the CPGM's Rapid Understanding of Nucleotide variant Effect Software (RUNES v1.0). RUNES incorporates data from the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) software, and produces comparisons to NCBI dbSNP, known disease mutations from the Human Gene Mutation Database and performs additional in silico prediction of variant consequences such as the effect of the variant on amino acid translation or splicing using ENSEMBL and UCSC gene annotations. RUNES categorizes each variant according to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG's) recommendations for reporting sequence variation as well as an allele frequency derived from CPGM's Variant Warehouse database. Mitochondrial variants were further characterized by using mitoMap.<SEP>5.4. Capillary sequencing<SEP>Primers and PCR conditions are available upon request. PCR products were purified using Exo-Sapit (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) according to manufacturer's instructions. Both the forward and reverse strands of the purified PCR product were sequenced using fluorescent dye-terminator sequencing. Sequencing reactions were purified using the BigDye XTerminator Purification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Results were analyzed on an ABI 3130 analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequence results were compared to published reference sequences using Sequencher 4.5 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).<SEP>5.5. Data and materials<SEP>The genomic sequence data for this study have been deposited in the database dbGAP. Please contact authors for accession numbers.","3. Results<SEP>Exome enrichment and sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 was performed on CMH000067 and her two healthy parents (CMH000068 & CMH000069). The exome sequencing of CMH000067 generated a total of 7.7 gigabases of sequence resulting in a mean nuclear exome coverage of 59.6× and 86.0% of exome targets were covered at 16× or greater (Table 1), a suitable value for accurate heterozygous variant genotyping. Sequencing reads were aligned using GSNAP and only unambiguous, uniquely aligned reads which aligned best to a single location in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome were evaluated for variant calls. Despite nuclear exome enrichment, the mitochondrial genome remained present and was sequenced concomitantly to an average depth of 25.5× resulting in 99.06% covered at 10× or greater (Table 1). The parental exomes were sequenced to >6 gigabases and had 88.05% and 88.52% of nuclear exome targets and 81.6% and 95.69% mtDNA covered at 10× or greater respectively (Table 1). A total of 105,487 variants including 10 mtDNA variants were discovered in CMH000069. Analysis revealed an apparently homoplasmic de novo mutation in mtDNA 8993T>G (c.467T>G, p.Leu156Arg) in the ATP synthase 6 gene (MT-ATP6, OMIM #516060; Fig. 2A). The variant was seen in 21 of 21 sequencing reads covering the base. This is a known disease causing variant responsible for 10–20% of Leigh syndrome (OMIM #256000) cases due to deficient activity of complex V (ATP synthase) in the electron transport chain, however previous clinical sequencing of mtDNA in this patient did not include MT-ATP6. A clinically validated restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay as well as capillary sequencing was used to confirm these findings on DNA from both blood and urine from the child (Fig. 2B). The 8993T>G mutation was not seen in maternal DNA from blood by next-generation exome sequencing, but coverage (15×) was likely insufficient for the detection of low levels of heteroplasmy. Although the 8993 mutation is usually well-represented in blood, we tested DNA isolated from both maternal urine and blood using capillary sequencing and PCR/RFLP analysis. Although the mutation was undetectable, these methods may fail to detect heteroplasmy of less than 10%. Consequently, as most cases of Leigh syndrome due to the 8993 mutation are maternally inherited, we cannot rule out that the mother may have a low level of heteroplasmy.<SEP>Exome sequencing was conducted on the proband (CMH000254), her deceased sibling (CMH000255), and both parents. All samples were sequenced to a depth of at least 8 gigabases resulting in greater than 87% of the targeted regions receiving 10× or greater coverage (Table 1). Less than 4% of the exome received 0× coverage. A total of ~3500 variants for each sample were characterized as category 1–3 by RUNES (Supplement Table 2,). Briefly, category 1 variants are those previously described as disease causing, category 2 are those variants of the type likely to disrupt protein function and be disease causing if they are in a gene associated with disease and category 3 are variants of unknown significance that may or may not cause disease. Filtering variants to exclude those present at an allele frequency of > 1% in the Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine internal database, which includes all variants ever detected from samples sequenced at the center and the corresponding frequency, resulted in nearly an 8-fold reduction in the number of variants (Table 2). Using a recessive inheritance model, variants were filtered to only include homozygous variants or genes in which there were two or more variants inherited on different alleles. Further filtering of variants was accomplished by limiting variants to those that were shared by both affected siblings and resulted in a total number of 29 variants to investigate in 18 genes (Table 3). Of the 18 genes only six were associated with disease in OMIM, with NDUFV1 being the only gene associated with metabolism. Both infants were found to be compound heterozygotes for two missense variants in the NDUFV1 gene c.736G>A, p.Glu246Lys (Fig. 3A) and c.349G>A, p.Ala117Thr (Fig. 3B). The parents each carry one variant, confirming they are present on opposite alleles. While neither variant has been previously reported, both affect highly conserved codons and are predicted to be damaging by in silico analysis. Furthermore, the Ala117Thr variant has been found by clinical testing in addition to a second novel missense mutation in a patient with confirmed mitochondrial disease (personal communication—Renkui Bai). This genotype was interpreted as being likely pathogenic and confirmed clinically by capillary sequencing (Figs. 3A & B). NDUFV1 encodes a 464 amino acid long protein that functions to release electrons from NADH via complex 1 of the electron transport chain, with resultant movement of the electrons to ubiquinone. The protein contains NADH, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and iron–sulfur cluster binding sites that are predicted to be necessary for proper functioning of complex I. The Glu246Lys mutation occurs in the FMN binding site and could potentially be involved in binding of NADH.<SEP>DNA isolated from peripheral blood cells from CMH000036 was enriched for the nuclear exome and sequenced to 8.7 gigabases, producing mean target nuclear exome coverage of 71.9× and mtDNA coverage of 30.1× (Table 1). A total of 150,740 nuclear and 32 mtDNA variants were found. Of these variants 3242 were classified as category 1–3 by RUNES (Table 2). Applying a variant filter of less than 1% frequency in our internal database reduced the number of variants to 790. Due to lack of parental samples all genes with homozygous variants and genes with two or more variants were considered to be consistent with a recessive inheritance pattern, which limited the total variants to 141 in 67 genes. Of these variants, three were categorized 1 (Table 3) as previously reported disease causing mutations including c.437G>A (Ser146Asn) in coenzyme Q2 homolog, prenyltransferase (COQ2). The c.437G>A mutation was seen in 41 of 63 reads covering the position (Fig. 4A). Mutations in COQ2 have been reported to cause coenzyme Q10 deficiency (OMIM #609825). Further analysis of variants in COQ2 revealed a second variant c.1159C>T present in 14 of 30 sequencing reads (Fig. 4B), which causes an arginine to change to a premature stop codon at amino acid position 387 (Arg387X). Taken together, these variants in combination with the clinical phenotype are consistent with a diagnosis of coenzyme Q10 deficiency. In addition, we found a novel variant (3754C>A) in the mitochondrial genome-encoded NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, MT-ND1 gene (Supplement Fig. 1). This variant was found in 8 of 36 sequence reads aligned to this nucleotide in the mitochondrial genome, implying ~22% heteroplasmy in peripheral blood. The variant was not found in more than 1400 other samples sequenced at CMH and was not reported in MitoMap, suggesting it to be a novel variant. Unfortunately, a sample from the mother could not be obtained. Subunit 1 is one of seven mtDNA encoded subunits included among the approximately 41 polypeptides of respiratory complex I. Mutations in MT-ND1 cause a wide range of disorders, including Leber optic atrophy (OMIM #535000), mitochondrial complex I deficiency (OMIM #252010) and MELAS (OMIM #540000). Subsequent capillary sequencing of DNA isolated from the blood, lung, and heart confirmed the 3754C>A mutation and was estimated to be ~25% heteroplasmic on the basis of relative dideoxynucleotide peaks (Supplement Fig. 2).","4. Discussion<SEP>Genomic medicine, empowered by whole exome and whole genome sequencing, has been widely heralded as potentially transformational for medical practice. Many of the early successes of genomic medicine have come from monogenic disease discovery and diagnosis, particularly in disorders that feature clinical and genetic heterogeneities. Mitochondrial diseases have both types of heterogeneity. Clinical features are often shared between multiple diseases making it difficult to arrive at a singular clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, mitochondrial disease may be inherited either as mutations in nuclearly encoded genes or in a homoplasmic or heteroplasmic manner with the respect to the mitochondrial genome. These attributes greatly complicate accurate diagnosis of individuals suspected to have one of these disorders. Herein we present four cases where exome sequencing yielded a molecular diagnosis after none were identified using conventional methods.<SEP>The diagnosis of Leigh syndrome (LS, OMIM #256000) in CMH000067 was made through the identification of an apparently homoplasmic known disease-causing mutation (8993T>G) in MT-ATP6. Although whole exome sequencing is not normally needed to detect this specific variant, the fact that MT-ATP6 gene sequencing had not been included in the more than 30 genes clinically sequenced exemplifies the difficulty in ordering clinical sequencing for mitochondrial disorders. LS is an early-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a characteristic neuropathology consisting of focal, bilateral lesions in one or more areas of the central nervous system, including the brainstem, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The lesions are areas of demyelination, gliosis, necrosis, spongiosis, or capillary proliferation. Clinical symptoms depend on which areas of the central nervous system are involved. The most common underlying cause is a defect in oxidative phosphorylation. About 50% of children with LS die by 3 years of age; however, clinical progression can be variable and long-term outcomes cannot be predicted based on genotype alone. For example, in individuals harboring the 8993T>G mutation, higher 8993G heteroplasmy is often associated with LS while moderate heteroplasmy is associated with less severe manifestations (weakness with ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP)). While there is no cure for LS, there are treatments that may improve cellular energetics. Obtaining a definitive molecular diagnosis allowed for improved medical management for this patient by the patient's treating physician, including the administration of sodium bicarbonate for chronic lactic acidemia, treatment of seizures with antiepileptic medications, and carnitine supplementation to aid excretion of abnormal byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation.<SEP>Respiratory chain deficiencies have been increasingly recognized in individuals presenting with a wide range of clinical problems, including encephalopathy, intransigent lactic acidemia and early death. The electron transport chain consists of four membrane associated complexes that function to ultimately provide reducing substances for oxidative phosphorylation of ADP by ATP synthase (complex V). Approximately 30% of respiratory chain disorders are caused by deficiency of complex I, the largest complex of the respiratory chain. Complex I is a multi-subunit complex of which 7 are encoded by mitochondrial DNA and at least 38 are encoded by nuclear DNA. It functions to channel electrons from NADH to ubiquinone and has, in addition to an NADH binding site, a flavin mononucleotide and Fe–S binding sites. NDUFV1 is a core subunit of complex I and is necessary for catalytic activity. To date, seventeen distinct mutations in the gene NDUFV1 have been described (Supplement Table 3) with clinical effects ranging from early infantile death to more classic features of Leigh syndrome. CMH000254 and CMH000255 presented with fulminate metabolic acidosis and lactic acidemia complicated by a neonatal encephalopathy which was highly suggestive of an inborn error of energy metabolism. Using this information to direct analysis of sequence data generated by exome sequencing, we were able to identify two mutations in the NDUFV1 gene, c.349G>A(A117T) and c.736G>A(Q246K), both of which are predicted to be deleterious by SIFT and/or PolyPhen2 conservation analysis models. These mutations have only been found in this family within the CMH variant database that houses data from over 1400 patients sequenced. These changes were confirmed by capillary sequencing in both affected infants and their parents. The mother is heterozygous for the c.349G>A(A117T) variant while the father carries the c.736G>A(Q246K) change, confirming they were present on opposite alleles in the affected offspring. While in vitro studies have not been completed, these variants are similar to other known mutations in the NDUFV1 gene. NDUFV1 is a core subunit in the N module of complex I. The N module functions as the electron input module and has flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as well as Fe–S clusters. This module binds NADH and oxidizes it, resulting in the transfer of electrons via FMN to the Fe–S clusters. Electrons are then transferred from the N module to the Q module which transfers them to ubiquinone. The complex also includes a P module which translocates protons across the membrane. Several mutations (E214K, Y204C, C206G) have been predicted to possibly disrupt FMN binding with resultant decreased electron transfer, while others (A211V, A341V, R257Q, R386C, T423M) affect NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, chain F. In our patients, one amino acid change is found proximal to residues felt to be involved in FMN binding while the second is near residues predicted to be involved in oxidoreductase activity. This could explain the more severe phenotype observed as failure of electron transfer and resultant deficiency of energy production in combination with diminished oxidoreductase activity.<SEP>In the last patient, CMH000036, we were able to diagnose the patient with coenzyme Q10 deficiency due to two mutations in COQ2. Similar to previous reports of COQ2 mutations our patient exhibited oligohydramnios and renal disease. In addition, we also discovered an apparently heteroplasmic variant in MT-ND1 (3754C>A). This variant was novel in our internal database of greater than 1400 sequenced individuals and has not been reported in MitoMap. Previous case reports of patients with MT-ND1 mutations exhibit significant overlap with the clinical features seen in CMH000036 and are consistent with the severe manifestations. Lacking viable tissue from the patient for functional studies or access to a maternal sample, we used the scoring system for determining the pathogenicity of mtDNA variants established by Mitchell and colleagues, which puts significant weight on heteroplasmy, conservation of the residue (Supplement Fig. 3), and demonstration of a biochemical defect in affected tissues. The 3754C>A variant scores in the 18–21 range, which is in the high possible/low probable range for being pathogenic. Additional functional studies, such as mitochondrial cybrid studies are needed to confirm the pathogenicity of this variant. As such, this variant is considered a variant of unknown significance. Importantly, it was detectable in the heteroplasmic state without specifically targeting the mitochondrial genome, highlighting the potential of exome sequencing to detect this type of pathogenic variant. We are unable to completely rule out the possibility that CMH000036 had two distinct disorders, CoQ10 deficiency and one of the disorders associated with MT-ND1 mutations such as Leber optic atrophy (OMIM #535000), mitochondrial complex I deficiency (OMIM #252010) or MELAS (OMIM #540000). However, we feel that it is highly likely due to the severity of the phenotype that the CoQ10 deficiency was the primary cause of the clinical phenotype caused by the mutations in the COQ2.<SEP>While the identification of pathogenic changes in these patients did not result in significant changes in management or outcome, in the future, early identification of such conditions will likely play a major role. In mitochondrial disorders in general, there is little other than anecdotal evidence to support the use of therapies such as carnitine, creatine, vitamins or bicarbonate. Confirming that individuals have primary mitochondrial disorders could be the first step in developing thoughtful clinical trials of these compounds to assess their efficacy. For example, knowing that complex V ATPase activity is diminished allows for the thoughtful addition of creatine as an alternative source for the generation of GTP. In other cases, early diagnosis will allow for parents to make educated decisions about painful, life-prolonging interventions that will ultimately prove futile. Knowing the recurrence risk is also important for those making reproductive choices including the possibility of the identification of carrier status in biologically related individuals, prenatal diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies or choosing different reproductive options, such as egg or sperm donor or adoption.<SEP>Several recent reports have demonstrated the efficacy of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders. A panel that enriched ~1000 nuclear mitochondrial genes and the mt genome identified known disease causing mutations in 24% of patients and novel candidate mutations in an additional 31% of patients with mitochondrial phenotypes. A separate study used a targeted approach to analyze nuclearly encoded mitochondrial genes and was able to identify several pathogenic mutations in known genes as well as identifying novel candidate mutations and genes, yet did not analyze the mtDNA in their study. A benefit of using deep NGS of the mtDNA is the potential ability to detect lower levels of heteroplasmy and more accurately impute the percentage of heteroplasmy. To this end, using a targeted approach similar to Calvo et al. allows for far greater depth of coverage (e.g. >1000×) and sensitivity as compared to using a standard exome enrichment (~50×), but requires the use of a custom targeted panel. Our findings clearly demonstrate the utility of using a standard exome kit for examining the mtDNA and discovery of both homoplasmic and heteroplasmic variants. However, in our experience there are multiple factors that affect the level of coverage obtained by target enrichment. Specifically, we have observed, as reported by others, that there is a difference in the coverage of the mtDNA given the same amount of sequence using exome kits from different manufactures (unpublished data,). For example, in our lab more consistent and deeper mtDNA coverage is obtained with Illumina exome kits as compared to NimbleGen or Agilent, using DNA isolated from cell culture versus blood, using smaller targeted panels of ~2 megabases that do not specifically target the mtDNA, and using different alignment algorithms (unpublished data). Consequently, we recommend that the coverage of the mtDNA and the sensitivity and specificity of mtDNA variant detection should be analyzed for each protocol and method used. In this study we specifically chose to use Illumina exome enrichment because using our methods we consistently obtain greater than 50× coverage of uniquely aligning reads with 6 gigabases or more of sequencing, which allows for analysis of both the nuclear and mtDNA genomes. It should be cautioned, however, that there are multiple limitations to next generation exome sequencing for clinical and molecular diagnostic purposes that we and others have reported. For example, many bioinformatic pipelines are not well suited for detection of large insertions or deletions. The pipeline used in this manuscript cannot accurately detect insertions over 40 nts or deletions larger than 25 nts (Saunders et al., manuscript in prep). Copy number variations are also not automatically detected, but can be identified.<SEP>In conclusion, we show that the identification of nuclearly-encoded disease causing mutations and both homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mitochondrial variants may be detected using exome sequencing without specifically enriching for mitochondrial sequences. This is highly useful given the locus heterogeneity of mitochondrial disorders that extends to two separate genomes. In both of these cases, although mitochondrial disease was suspected, multiple diagnostic tests failed to identify the molecular basis of the disease. The broad net cast by exome and gene panel sequencing appears to be able to detect cases of nuclearly and potentially mitochondrially-encoded diseases, and is likely to offer a higher yield than testing small panels of genes based on clinical or biochemical phenotype. We show in three unrelated families, that exome sequencing can indeed be effective; however, we propose that additional studies to examine the specificity and sensitivity in a larger number of samples are needed before it is considered as a primary diagnostic tool for patients with mitochondrial diseases.",28587,['VITMIN']
29265379,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>The endogenous opioid system is involved with the acute behavioral effects of alcohol and is a pharmacological target for treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD; for review,). Alcohol increases endogenous opioid transmission in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system which mediates both the hedonically rewarding and motivationally salient effects of alcohol. Blocking this endogenous opioid activity with opioid receptor antagonists, such as naltrexone, or via mu-opioid receptor knockout reduces alcohol self-administration and preference in rodents. In humans, naltrexone reduces alcohol’s acute, pleasurable subjective effects (e.g., stimulation, liking, high, etc.), alcohol self-administration in the laboratory, and alcohol consumption in the real world. Despite the robust translational evidence implicating the endogenous opioid system in the pharmacology of alcohol, treatment outcomes with naltrexone appear to be modest in effect size and highly variable at the individual level. Accordingly, a sizable line of research has sought to identify biobehavioral factors associated with successful naltrexone treatment outcomes in order to optimize its clinical benefits.<SEP>Genetic variation in the endogenous opioid system has been identified as one potential source of individual variability in naltrexone treatment outcomes. As reviewed in detail elsewhere, the majority of naltrexone pharmacogenetic studies have focused on a particular single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1; rs1799971; commonly known as the Asn40Asp SNP) with decidedly mixed results. After alcohol administration in the laboratory, carriers of the minor Asp40 allele have self-administered more alcohol, reported greater subjective stimulation, reward, and positive mood, and demonstrated greater striatal dopamine response compared with Asn40 homozygotes. Because of such laboratory findings, the minor Asp40 allele has been referred to as a “risk” allele for the development of AUD, and it has been speculated that Asp40 carriers may find alcohol more rewarding and drink more heavily in the real world. Furthermore, preclinical studies using humanized mice and human laboratory studies have both reported that naltrexone was more effective in reducing alcohol reward and/or consumption in Asp40 carriers vs. Asn40 homozygotes. Recent meta-analyses of retrospective pharmacogenetic trials have found that the Asp40 allele is moderately associated with naltrexone’s reduction in heavy drinking. Although these positive results, when taken as a whole, suggest that individuals with at least one Asp40 allele, compared with Asn40 homozygotes, may be more sensitive to the acute effects of alcohol and more responsive to naltrexone pharmacotherapy, other laboratory studies and prospective pharmacogenetic trials have failed to replicate these associations, leaving the potential of personalizing naltrexone treatment based on OPRM1 uncertain.<SEP>Many factors may underlie the inconsistent findings related to the Asn40Asp SNP, including the probable small effect size of OPRM1 on responses to alcohol and naltrexone, the heterogeneity of AUD, and the poor understanding of the molecular significance of the Asn40Asp SNP on mu-opioid receptor function. Additionally, the majority of AUD studies that have assessed the effects of the Asn40Asp SNP on response to naltrexone have been retrospective or secondary analyses that were confined to Caucasian samples due to concerns about population stratification effects. As the minor allele frequency of the Asn40Asp SNP is approximately 20% in Caucasian populations, post hoc analysis of this variant has often been performed in underpowered sample sizes. Further, as research samples in North America are predominantly composed of Caucasian individuals, retrospective genetic studies are often underpowered to address whether the findings can be extended to other ethnic groups, and prospective genetic studies generally only include one race. The frequency of the OPRM1 Asp40 allele is imbalanced across ethnicity, such that the minor allele frequency is approximately 20% in Caucasians, 5% in individuals of African ancestry, and up to 50% among individuals of East Asian descent (i.e., Chinese, Korean, or Japanese). Thus, in light of the overall mixed findings regarding the Asn40Asp SNP in predominantly Caucasian samples with AUD, there is a need for replication and extension of the role of OPRM1 variation in naltrexone treatment outcomes to ethnically diverse populations.<SEP>Despite the high prevalence of the Asp40 allele in East Asian populations, only two studies have examined naltrexone pharmacogenetics in East Asian individuals with AUD. First, a small naltrexone clinical trial in Korean alcohol-dependent patients reported that Asp40 carriers who were medication compliant had a significantly longer time to relapse than Asn40 homozygotes. Second, a preliminary study from our group examined the effects of naltrexone in heavy drinkers of East Asian descent. In this pilot randomized, crossover laboratory study, a total of 35 participants completed an intravenous alcohol (up to 0.06 g/dl) administration session after taking naltrexone or placebo for four days. We found that Asp40 carriers, vs. Asn40 homozygotes, experienced greater alcohol-induced sedation, subjective intoxication, and lower alcohol craving on naltrexone compared with placebo. As alcohol-induced sedation and intoxication are believed to capture the aversive dimension of subjective response to alcohol, these preliminary results may provide initial evidence for the biobehavioral mechanism by which naltrexone may be particularly effective in reducing alcohol use in Asp40 carriers of East Asian descent. The present study seeks to replicate and extend upon our previous findings.<SEP>These preliminary results, if supported and extended in larger studies, may be especially useful in targeting the use of naltrexone in Asian populations in the US and worldwide. While there are genetic protective factors against AUD in Asian populations, recent studies have suggested that AUD is a significant public health problem in East Asian countries. Individuals of East Asian descent are more likely to possess variants of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase genes that increase aversive responses to alcohol and are protective against development of AUD. Despite these protective factors, South Korea has comparable or higher rates of AUD than the U.S.A., and the World Health Organization has characterized high risk drinking as reaching epidemic levels in China. One factor that may contribute to problematic drinking in East Asian populations is that the OPRM1 Asp40 variant may increase the likelihood of developing AUD in Asians but not Caucasians. Thus, AUD patients of East Asian descent may stand to benefit from the pharmacogenetic optimization of naltrexone for AUD on the basis of OPRM1 genotype to a greater extent than other ethnic groups due to the variant’s high prevalence and risk predisposition. However, not all studies support this notion: one laboratory study found that OPRM1 modulation of HPA-axis response to a naloxone challenge was only observed in Caucasian healthy controls and not individuals of Asian descent.<SEP>The goal of the present study is to replicate and extend our preliminary findings by testing the effects of naltrexone on subjective response to alcohol and alcohol self-administration in individuals of East Asian descent genotyped for the OPRM1 Asn40Asp variant. Based on our previous findings, we hypothesized that naltrexone, compared with placebo, would potentiate the aversive and sedative effects of alcohol and reduce alcohol self-administration to a greater extent in Asp40 carriers vs. Asn40 homozygotes.","METHOD<SEP>Study Overview<SEP>Participants across all three OPRM1 genotypes (Asn40Asn, n = 29; Asn40Asp, n= 34, and Asp40Asp, n = 14) completed two double-blinded and counterbalanced experimental sessions: one after taking naltrexone (50 mg/day) for five days and one after taking matched placebo for five days. In each experimental session, participants received a priming dose of IV alcohol up to the breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) target of 0.06 g/dl which was immediately followed by a 1-hour alcohol self-administration period.<SEP>Participants<SEP>Participants were recruited between July 2013 and December 2016 from the community through fliers, online and print advertisements, and social media (i.e., advertisement in blogs targeting the Asian American community) in the Los Angeles area between December 2013 and September 2016. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) a score of 8 or higher on the Alcohol-Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), indicating a heavy drinking pattern; (2) East Asian ethnicity (i.e., Chinese, Korean, Japanese, or Taiwanese); and (3) between the ages of 21 and 55. In all, 87 (29 females) non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers were randomized in this trial. The average age was 26.8 (SD 6.15; range 21–47), and of the 77 participants enrolled in this study, the following ethnic background was reported: 25 (32.5 %) Chinese descent, 35 (45.5%) Korean descent, 8 (10.4%) Japanese descent, and 9 (11.7%) Taiwanese descent. Participants with a history of depression with suicidal ideation, lifetime psychotic disorder, lifetime substance use disorder (except marijuana), or ≥10 on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment-revised (CIWA-R), indicating clinically significant alcohol withdrawal were excluded. All female participants tested negative for pregnancy and all subjects had a BrAC of zero before each session. The study was approved by the University of California Los Angeles Institutional Review Board.<SEP>Screening Procedures<SEP>Initial assessment of the eligibility criteria was conducted through a telephone interview. Eligible participants were invited to the laboratory for additional screening. Upon arrival, participants read and signed an informed consent form and provided a saliva sample for DNA analyses. Participants then completed a series of individual differences measures and interviews, including a demographics questionnaire and the Timeline Follow-back (TLFB) to assess for quantity and frequency of drinking over the past 30 days. All participants were required to test negative on a urine drug test (except for marijuana, which was allowed to be positive). Prospective genotyping was not utilized in this study due to the anticipated allele frequency of nearly 50% and the successful utilization of this approach by our group previously. Eligible participants attended a physical examination at the UCLA Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) conducted by the study physician (KM). A total of 199 participants (78 women) were screened in the laboratory, 106 completed the physical exam, 5 of whom were ineligible for medical reasons and 14 of whom decided not to participate in the trial, leaving 87 participants who enrolled and were randomized. Of the 87 individuals randomized, 77 completed at least one alcohol administration session, and 72 completed the entire study. No demographic, genotype, or drug and alcohol-related differences were observed between those ten participants who dropped-out post randomization and those who completed one or more experimental sessions (p’s ≥ 0.14). Participants were assigned to a medication sequence based on the simple randomization pattern of ABBA. See Figure 1 for a CONSORT Diagram for this trial.<SEP>Medication Procedures and Alcohol Administration<SEP>Participants completed one alcohol infusion session after taking naltrexone for 5 days (25 mg for days 1 and 2 and 50 mg for days 3–5) and one infusion session after taking a matched placebo for 5 days (minimum of 7-day wash-out period between conditions). Active medication and placebo were delivered in a counterbalanced and double-blinded fashion. Participants were asked to report any side effects to the study physician. Six participants dropped out of the study as a result of anticipated medication side effects. Active medication and placebo capsules were packaged with 50mg of riboflavin allowing for medication compliance to be examined via urine samples collected immediately prior to each infusion session. Analyzed under ultraviolet light, all samples tested positive for riboflavin content.<SEP>The testing session consisted of two portions, intravenous alcohol administration and oral alcohol self-administration. All participants tested negative for drugs (except marijuana) and women tested negative for pregnancy prior to the experimental session. Participants were asked to fast for two hours before arrival and were given a standardized meal before the alcohol administration began. Smokers were allowed to smoke a cigarette immediately prior to the alcohol infusion procedures to mitigate cigarette-induced craving. Approximately 2 hours prior to the alcohol infusion, participants ingested the final dose of medication (day 5) under observation, were seated in a recliner chair, and the IV was placed in their non-dominant arm. After completing the baseline assessment, participants received intravenous infusions of alcohol. The intravenous route of administration was chosen in order to reduce and control BAC variability between subjects as well as eliminate alcohol cues and expectancies. The intravenous alcohol administration procedure was consistent with methods our group has previously developed. Infusion rates were 0.166 ml/min × weight (in kg) for males and 0.126 ml/min × weight for females. Target BrACs were as follows: 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06 g/dl. Upon reaching each of the target levels of BrAC, participants’ infusion rates were reduced to half, to maintain stable BrAC during testing. The ethanol infusion yielded highly controlled BrACs, such that the observed mean (SD) BrACs were as follows: 0.022 (0.002), 0.042 (0.002), and 0.062 (0.003) g/dl across medication conditions. Time to each target BrAC was, on average, 16.56 (5.12), 48.76 (13.14), and 88.08 (21.02) minutes, respectively. Upon completion of the alcohol infusion, participants immediately began an oral self-administration session (1-hour long). Participants were offered four mini-drinks of their preferred beverage and allowed to watch a movie. The mini-drinks allowed participants to consume up to .04 g/dl (i.e., .01 g/dl per mini-drink) alcohol over the one-hour period. Drink sizes were determined by participant’s gender, weight, height, and alcohol content. Participants had one hour to either consume the mini drinks, or receive one dollar for every drink remaining. Participants notified study team before consuming a mini-drink and were breathalyzed before drinking in addition to every 10 minutes. As a precaution, if BrAC ≥.100 g/dl, participants had to wait until BrAC dropped before consuming the drink (n.b.: this event was not encountered in the study). Participants were then given a meal and asked to stay at the CTRC for a 4-hour period allowing their BrAC to drop below 0.020 g/dl or to 0.000 g/dl if driving. See Figure 2 for Study Design Flow Chart.<SEP>Measures<SEP>As specified a-priori on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02026011), the primary outcome measures were the subjective effects of alcohol and the secondary outcome measures were related to alcohol self-administration. During the intravenous alcohol administration, measures of subjective responses to alcohol and alcohol craving were administered at baseline, at each target BrAC, and after 30 minutes and 60 minutes of self-administration. As a check-on-blind, participants reported which medication (naltrexone vs placebo) they believed to have received before each infusion session. The following measures were used: (1) The Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE) was administered before each infusion session to assess for 24 common drug side effects and has been recommended for use in clinical trials; (2) Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) consists of eight items assessing the urge to drink, each rated on a seven-point Likert scale (‘Strongly Disagree’ to ‘Strongly Agree’). Across various studies, the AUQ shows high internal consistency; (3) The Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES), a valid and reliable measure, assesses stimulation and sedation induced by alcohol, and consists of 14 items rated on a 0–10 scale. The secondary measures obtained from the self-administration session were (a) total number of drinks consumed, and (b) latency to first drink (in seconds).<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>Oragene saliva kits were used to collect samples for DNA analysis at the in-person screening visit. The UCLA Genotyping and Sequencing (GenoSeq) Core assayed OPRM1 (rs1799971), alcohol dehydrogenase gene (ADH1B, rs1229984), and aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH2, rs671). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were labeled with fluorescent dye (6-FAM, VIC, or NED), and PCR was performed on Applied Biosystems dual block PCR thermal cyclers. An AB 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System ran the SNP sequencing and analyzed using the Sequence Detection Systems software version 2.3. Each run included two positive control samples (individual 2 in CEPH family 1347; Coriell Institute). Allele calling software automatically scored the genotypes and verified by visual inspection. The average call, reproducibility, and concordance rates are 96%, 99.7%, and 99.8%, respectively, at the UCLA GenoSeq Core.<SEP>Data Analytic Plan<SEP>Analyses for the alcohol infusion session were conducted using a multilevel mixed modeling framework with the mixed modeling procedures in SAS version 9.4 to examine genotype group differences on medication response. Due to participants receiving multiple alcohol infusion sessions, a linear mixed model with random intercepts was used to address the issues of non-independence of observations in the data. For each multilevel model, Medication, and BrAC were within subject measures (nested within subjects), while Genotype was a between subject measures. The analyses examined the effects of Medication, a two-level within subjects factor (Placebo vs Naltrexone, coded 0 and 1), Genotype, a two-level between subjects factor (Asn40 homozygotes vs. Asp40 carriers, coded 0 and 1), BrAC, a three-level within subjects factor (BrAC = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 g/dl, coded 0–2) and their interactions. The dependent variables were alcohol craving (AUQ) and subjective response to alcohol (BAES). All models included robust estimation for standard errors to account for heteroscedasticity amongst dependent variables.<SEP>For the self-administration session, the outcome measures were (a) total number of drinks consumed, and (b) latency to first drink. Poisson regression models were used to examine the effects of medication, genotype, and their interactions on total number of drinks consumed, while a series of Cox proportional hazard regressions were conducted to examine these effects on latency to first drink. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for medication, genotype and their interaction.<SEP>In all analyses, reports of main effects were derived from models that did not include the Medication × OPRM1 Genotype interaction term.","RESULTS<SEP>Baseline and Demographic Comparisons<SEP>Pre-test comparisons were conducted to determine whether the OPRM1 groups differed based on demographic and drinking variables. There were no significant OPRM1 genotype group differences across demographic variables (p’s > 0.05). Results revealed significant genotype group differences across drinking variables, specifically AUDIT score, number of drinking days, and drinks per drinking day in the past 30 days. Table 1. All subsequent analyses controlled for these variables found to differ across OPRM1 genotype. Notably, coefficients did not change in statistical significance when comparing models including AUDIT score, drinking days, or drinks per drinking day as covariates. Therefore, all models included only drinking days as the representative covariate for OPRM1 genotype group differences in drinking. To further validate the main results, all analyses controlled for ALDH2 (rs671) and ADH1B (rs1229984) markers. Analyses of subjective response during the alcohol infusion session controlled for baseline (i.e. BrAC = 0.00 g/dl) levels of subjective response on the corresponding outcome variable.<SEP>A series of Fisher’s exact tests, non-parametric tests accounting for small cell sizes, were conducted to examine 24 possible side effects from the medication as indicated by the SAFTEE checklist. Results revealed a significant association between medication and drowsiness, which occurred in 20% of participants while on naltrexone in comparison to 7% while on placebo (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.05). There was also a significant medication association on ringing in the ears, which occurred in 3% of participants when taking naltrexone in comparison to 1% while taking placebo (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.03). There were no significant medication associations on the remaining 22 side effects measured by the SAFTEE (Fisher’s exact test, p > 0.05), including nausea. There were also no significant differences in side effects as a function of OPRM1 genotype (Fisher’s exact test, p > 0.05).<SEP>Pharmacogenetic Effects: Alcohol Craving<SEP>Analyses of alcohol-induced craving revealed no simple effect of genotype (b = 0.20, SE = 0.21, t = 0.96, p = 0.34), medication (b = −0.15, SE = 0.17, t = −0.86, p = 0.39), or medication × genotype interaction (b = 0.15, SE = 0.21, t = 0.73, p = 0.47). There was not a significant medication × genotype × BrAC interaction (b = −0.20, SE = 0.13, t = −1.52, p = 0.13). As expected, there was an effect of BrAC (b = 0.13, SE = 0.06, t = 2.10, p = 0.04), such that participants reported higher levels of alcohol craving across rising BrAC levels. Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = 0.02) and baseline AUQ values (p < 0.01). Current cigarette smoking status, defined using a binary variable (i.e., 0 = non-smoker and 1 = smoker), was not a significant moderator of any of these effects (p ≥ 0.28).<SEP>Pharmacogenetic Effects: Subjective Response to Alcohol<SEP>Analyses of alcohol-induced sedation revealed no simple effect of genotype (b = −0.11, SE = 0.37, t = −0.30, p = 0.77), medication (b = 0.14, SE = 0.23, t = 0.61, p = 0.55), or medication × genotype interaction (b = −0.21, SE = 0.29, t = −0.72, p = 0.47). There was not a significant three-way interaction across medication × genotype × BrAC (b = 0.28, SE = 0.21, t = 1.30, p = 0.19). There was an effect of BrAC (b = 0.30, SE = 0.15, t = 2.02, p = 0.04) with participants reporting greater sedation across rising BrAC levels. Significant covariates included ADH1B genotype (p = 0.01) and baseline sedation values (p < 0.01). Nicotine smoking status was not a significant moderator of any of these effects (p ≥ 0.11).<SEP>Analyses of alcohol-induced stimulation revealed no simple effect of medication (b = 0.16, SE = 0.13, t = 1.20, p = 0.23), genotype (b = 0.37, SE = 0.22, t = 1.69, p = 0.09), or medication × genotype (b = 0.04, SE = 0.21, t = 0.20, p = 0.84). There was however a significant three-way interaction across medication × genotype × BrAC (b = −0.32, SE = 0.16, t = −1.93, p = 0.05); see Figure 3. Follow-up post-hoc analyses examined the effect of BrAC in each of the four medication × genotype groups. These post-hoc tests revealed significant positive effects of BrAC effects in all groups (p’s < 0.01), with the exception of the Asn40 homozygotes + placebo group (p = 0.10). Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = 0.03) and baseline stimulation values (p < 0.01). Nicotine smoking status was not a significant moderator of any of these effects (p ≥ 0.14).<SEP>Pharmacogenetic Effects: Alcohol Self-Administration<SEP>Poisson regression analyses for total number of drinks consumed revealed no significant main effect of medication (F (1,71) = 2.24, p = 0.14, naltrexone mean = 0.93, SD = 1.35 versus placebo mean = 1.19, SD = 1.43). There was a significant main effect of genotype (F (1,71) = 5.79, p = 0.02) such that Asp40 carriers consumed significantly fewer drinks (mean = 0.80, SD = 1.27) in comparison to Asn40 homozygotes (mean = 1.51, SD = 1.49). There was no significant medication × genotype interaction (F (1,70) = 0.68, p = 0.41). Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = .05). Smoking status was trending towards predicting greater self-administration (F(1,68)=3.87, p = 0.053), such that non-smokers consumed 0.83 (SD = 1.27) drinks versus 1.41 (SD = 1.50) for smokers. Smoking status did not moderate or affect any medication or genotype effects (p ≥ 0.25).<SEP>The distribution of latency to first drink was non-normal. Collapsed across medication conditions and genotype groups, 29% consumed their first drink immediately (within the first three minutes), 18% consumed their first drink at some point during the session (but not immediately), and 53% abstained during the entire session. Cox proportional regression models revealed no significant main effect of medication on latency to first drink (Wald χ2 = 2.58, p = 0.10, HR = .67); however, there was a significant main effect of genotype on latency to first drink (Wald χ2 = 3.39, p = 0.03, HR = 1.89) such that Asn40 homozygotes had a significantly shorter latency to first drink, Figure 4. When medication × genotype interaction was added to the models (Figure 5), the effect of genotype was no longer significant (p = 0.12) nor was the medication × genotype interaction (p = 0.63). There were no significant covariates across either model (p’s > 0.09). Smoking status was associated with marginally shorter latency to drink (Wald χ2 = 2.61, p = 0.07) but did not moderate the effects of genotype or medication (p ≥ 0.40).<SEP>Treating OPRM1 genotype as a three-level variable did not significantly alter the pharmacogenetic results reported above.","DISCUSSION<SEP>The literature on the pharmacogenetics of naltrexone, while initially promising, has not been conclusive and, as such, has limited translation to treatment. This human laboratory study examined individuals of East Asian descent, an ethnic group most likely to express the Asp40 allele of OPRM1, in order to advance the field of pharmacogenetics by identifying outcomes thought to predict a more favorable treatment response to naltrexone. Based on our previous findings, we hypothesized that naltrexone, compared with placebo, would potentiate the aversive and sedative effects of alcohol and reduce alcohol self-administration to a greater extent in Asp40 carriers vs. Asn40 homozygotes. As discussed in detail elsewhere, incorporating underrepresented groups in pharmacogenetics studies is critical addressing health disparities in the context of personalized medicine.<SEP>The results of our study have offered no support for an OPRM1 pharmacogenetic effect of naltrexone in individuals of East Asian descent. Specifically, medication and genotype effects on subjective responses to alcohol were notably absent in this trial. One may argue that differences in subjective responses in individuals of East Asian descent may result in an overall blunted craving and stimulant response to alcohol in the laboratory. Nevertheless, in this trial, there was a robust response to alcohol administration and a sufficient “slope” of alcohol-induced stimulation and craving for alcohol to detect meaningful genotype, medication, and pharmacogenetic effects. Further, while the IV alcohol administration effectively controls BrAC levels, it also removes relevant alcohol cues (e.g., alcohol taste, visual cues) which in turn may be relevant to capturing naltrexone effects on subjective craving for alcohol. Taken together, the lack of such significant findings suggests that OPRM1 pharmacogenetic effects may be small in magnitude and therefore difficult to replicate on a consistent basis.<SEP>In addition to measuring subjective responses to alcohol, this trial sought to measure alcohol intake in the laboratory by combining alcohol challenge (to a target BrAC of 0.06 g/dl) with a subsequent alcohol self-administration session. The target level of BrAC in this trial is higher than the 0.03 g/dl priming dose used in previous studies. Nevertheless, there was sufficient variability in drinking behavior, particularly with regard to latency to first drink, in order to detect any genetic or medication effects on alcohol self-administration. The self-administration data suggested a main effect of genotype such that Asp40 carriers consumed fewer drinks and had a longer latency to first drink in this study than Asn40 homozygotes. This is contrary to the expected “risky” value of the Asp40 allele and suggests that since the Asp40 carriers in this trial were less likely to self-administer, there was also less opportunity for naltrexone to exert its putative beneficial effects among this group. This result is consistent with our reported OPRM1 genotype differences on a host of drinking variables such that Asp40 carriers drank less and had lower AUDIT scores. Nevertheless, drinking variables were consistently accounted for in our models and controlling for these variables, as well as alcohol metabolizing genetic markers (ADH1B, rs1229984 and ALDH2, rs671), did not significantly alter the results reported herein.<SEP>In conclusion, this study found no support for interactive pharmacogenetic effects of the OPRM1 Asn40Asp SNP and naltrexone among individuals of East Asian descent. There were no pharmacogenetic effects observed for alcohol-induced stimulation, sedation, craving for alcohol, or alcohol self-administration in the laboratory. Notably, there were no medication main effects on those phenotypes, and the genetic main effect on alcohol self-administration suggested that the Asp40 allele was protective in the context of alcohol self-administration. These findings in East Asians add to the rather mixed literature on naltrexone pharmacogenetics in predominantly Caucasian samples and highlight the complexity of these effects and their overall limited replicability. In brief, despite the high prevalence of the Asp40 allele of the OPRM1 in individuals of East Asian descent, our study suggests that these individuals may not experience a disproportionate clinical benefit from naltrexone for AUD, insofar as the human laboratory methodology captures underlying mechanisms of clinical efficacy.<SEP>The current trial included a functional neuroimaging component (data not yet reported) which may be useful in elucidating pharmacogenetic effects at the neural levels of analyses, as elegantly reported by. Although a more recent fMRI study found that OPRM1 gene did not moderate the effects of naltrexone on cue-elicited activation of the ventral striatum among treatment seekers for AUD. Recent studies have suggested a cis-eQTL in OPRM1 that may be a causal variant within OPRM1, including its effects on subjective response to alcohol. As such, additional analyses of informative genetic markers within the OPRM1 gene may be warranted. Furthermore, consideration of pharmacogenetic effects within the context of ethnic diversity may be useful in elucidating population-specific effects and this may particularly useful for studies of naltrexone pharmacogenetic in individuals of East Asian ancestry.<SEP>Ultimately, however, the clinical application of this putative pharmacogenetic effect hinges on its clinical significance and whether it increases the precision of naltrexone treatment in the real world. As argued elsewhere, it plausible that a robust effect in tightly controlled preclinical and experimental medicine models “fades” as it is confronted with the complexities of real world clinical application as well as the heterogeneity of AUD. Nonetheless, the naltrexone pharmacogenetics line of inquiry has taught us that the more consistent implication of the Asn40Asp SNP of the OPRM1 gene may be in reward-related phenotypes and potentially the blunting of reward by naltrexone. To that end, identifying reward drinkers, whether via genotype or other reliable and clinically useful markers, may be a way to harness these findings into a potentially meaningful application to benefit those seeking care for AUD.<SEP>           DISCLOSURES         <SEP>None of the authors have conflicts of interest to disclose.",32516,['EATBTS']
34342185,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation is associated with stress adaptation. Stress-induced HPA axis activation may result in cortisol elevation. Excessive cortisol levels are responsible for hypertension, reduced immunity, metabolic changes and, death. Many factors can modify the HPA axis, such as smoking, nutrition, sleep, and disease. Drinking alcohol is one of the most important lifestyle factors affecting the HPA axis.<SEP>Recent studies of various aspects of the HPA axis have suggested a relationship between HPA axis function and alcohol use. Hospitalized patients with alcohol-use disorders have higher cortisol levels than patients without such disorders. In a population of climacteric women, alcohol was also positively correlated with cortisol levels. In addition to studies examining serum cortisol concentrations, studies of healthy males using overnight urinary cortisol gave similar results. However, some studies failed to find a significant relationship. Alcohol consumption is associated with many factors, such as sex, age, and chronic disease status, making it difficult to control all confounders in observational studies. Previous studies have adjusted for different confounders and some studies failed to show a relationship between alcohol consumption and serum cortisol levels. Therefore, there is some difficulty establishing a causal relationship between alcohol consumption and cortisol levels.<SEP>Mendelian randomization (MR) is widely used to avoid problems such as confounding effects and reverse causation, which prevents relationship estimation and assessment of the true causality among variables. Germline variants are randomly distributed in the general population with respect to phenotype. By using a variable that satisfies the three conditions in Table 1 as an instrumental variable (IV), a population can be divided into randomized subgroups with various phenotype levels. Therefore, MR using genetic variants as a proxy for risk factors of interest affects the random allocation in a randomized controlled study. These features make the results of the MR study more reliable than the observational study.<SEP>A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene, rs671, is common in East Asians and rare or absent in other ethnicities. Minor allele frequency of ALDH2 has strong ethnic heterogeneity; a previous study reported the minor allele frequency of ALDH2 as 17.4% in East Asians and 0% in South Asians, Americans, and Europeans. The genetic variant results in the inability to eliminate acetaldehyde. Consequently, after alcohol consumption, the blood acetaldehyde level is higher in AG heterozygotes and AA homozygotes than in GG homozygotes. The accumulation of aldehyde due to the nonfunctional ALDH2 variants causes facial flushing, nausea, headache, etc., a syndrome called ‘Oriental flushing.’ These symptoms prevent people with ALDH2 variants from drinking heavily. Therefore, ALDH2 rs671 may be a good instrumental variable for showing the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and serum cortisol. Consequently, we performed MR analysis using ALDH2 rs671 to examine the causal relationship between alcohol and serum cortisol concentrations in Korean adults (Fig. 1).","METHODS<SEP>Subjects<SEP>The subjects were from the Dong-gu Study, which was conducted in Dong District, Gwangju, Republic of Korea. The baseline survey was conducted from May 2007 to July 2010. Although there were 9,260 cohort participants, 338 were excluded because of missing values for the ALDH2 rs671 genotype, alcohol consumption, age, physical activity, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and education status. This analysis included the 8,922 participants with no missing values.<SEP>Covariates<SEP>All variables in the dataset were obtained from the Dong-gu Study. Age, physical activity, drinks per day, smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, and education status were surveyed using a questionnaire. Physical activity was defined as moderate physical activity performed for at least 30 minutes, five times a week, or high-intensity physical activity performed for at least 20 minutes, three times a week. Drinks per day were calculated using the number of drinking days per week and the number of standard drinks per drinking day. Smoking history was classified into never, former, and current smokers. Hypertension was defined as taking antihypertensive drugs or when the blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg or higher. Diabetes was defined as taking diabetic medication or when the plasma glucose level was 126 mg/dL or higher. Education was categorized into middle school or lower and high school or higher. Height and weight were measured in light clothing, without shoes, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated from the measured height and weight. Cortisol was measured with an immunoassay (ARCHITECT i2000; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). The coefficient of variation for the total analytic precision of this assay was less than ≤ 10%. The lower detection limits of this assay were 0.4 g/dL.<SEP>Genotyping the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism<SEP>PCR<SEP>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood with the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's protocol. rs671 was genotyped by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia), as previously described. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers (forward, 5′ TTGGTGGCTACAAGATGTCG 3′; reverse, 5′ CAGGTCCCACACTCACAGTTT 3′) produced a 97-bp amplicon. The reaction mixture for HRM contained 200 nM PCR primer, 1 µM SYTO 9 fluorescent dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 0.5 U F-Star Taq polymerase (BioFACT), and 40 ng genomic DNA in 10 µL reaction volumes. The  started at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 seconds and 58°C for 30 seconds.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>All analyses were performed separately for each sex because the sex difference of alcohol consumption is significant. The subjects' characteristics are shown as the mean ± standard deviation or number (%). One-way analysis of variance or χ2 tests were used to show the statistical significance of the difference in variables between each ALDH2 genotype. In the observational analysis, multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between drinks per day and serum cortisol levels after adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking status, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and education status. The two-stage least squares method of MR analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between the predicted daily alcohol consumption by ALDH2 genotypes and blood cortisol concentration. In the first stage, genetically predicted daily drinking was calculated for the ALDH2 genotypes. In the second stage, serum cortisol level was predicted from the genetically predicted alcohol consumption after adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking status, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and education status. All analyses were performed using R (ver. 4.0.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).<SEP>Ethics statement<SEP>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Chonnam National University Hospital (IRB No. I-2008-05-056). Informed consent was obtained from each participant.","RESULTS<SEP> Table 2 presents the baseline characteristics of the study population according to the ALDH2 rs671 genotypes in each sex. The mean daily drinks in men were 1.95, 0.39, and 0.12 for the GG, GA, and AA genotypes, respectively, and 0.14, 0.03, and < 0.01 in women. In both sexes, GG genotypes had the highest daily alcohol consumption. However, the difference of drinks per day between GG genotype and GA genotype was higher than between GA genotype and AA genotype. The pattern of cortisol levels according to genotypes varied by sex. The GA group had the lowest levels in men, and the AA group had the lowest levels in women, but the difference between groups was not significant in women. The difference of distribution of age between the genotypes are significant and the GA genotype group were older than other genotypes in both sexes. And BMI differed according to the rs671 polymorphism significantly in men.<SEP>Table 3 presents the results of the univariate and multivariate linear regression models in each sex. Daily alcohol consumption was positively associated with blood cortisol levels in the univariate model in both sexes. After adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and education status, the strength of the association between daily alcohol consumption and blood cortisol level was similar to the results of the univariate analysis in men but was higher in women.<SEP>Table 4 shows the association between the genetically predicted alcohol consumption and blood cortisol level in each sex. The MR results except for ex-drinkers, are presented as a sensitivity analysis. In men, all models showed a positive association of genetically predicted daily alcohol consumption and blood cortisol level. In the MR analysis, the genetically predicted one standard drink/day increases cortisol by 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21–0.51). In sensitivity analysis genetically predicted one standard drink/day elevates cortisol by 0.27 (95% CI, 0.14–0.41). However, there was no significant association between alcohol and cortisol in all models for women.","DISCUSSION<SEP>This MR study examined the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and cortisol levels. In the observational analysis, alcohol consumption was associated with increased cortisol levels in both sexes. In the MR analysis, the genetically predicted alcohol consumption was associated with increased serum cortisol levels in men.<SEP>Several observational studies have examined the association between alcohol consumption and cortisol levels. In hospitalized patients, an alcohol use disorder group had higher cortisol levels than a non-alcoholic group. There was a positive correlation between alcohol consumption and the serum cortisol levels in climacteric women. In male workers at an airplane manufacturing plant in southern Germany, the group who consumed more than 20 g of alcohol per day had higher cortisol levels than those who did not. By contrast, in retail workers, alcohol consumption had no effects on the salivary cortisol concentration. In college students, binge drinkers had lower cortisol levels than the control group. This inconsistency may be due to the difference in how alcohol consumption was measured and the difference in the adjusted confounders in each study.<SEP>In this study, MR analysis in men showed a positive relationship between alcohol consumption and the serum cortisol level. The effect size of drinks per day on serum cortisol was greater in the MR analysis than in the observational analysis. This difference in effect size between the MR analysis and the observational analysis may be due to unknown confounding factors that affect the cortisol level and alcohol consumption. In the MR analysis of women, there was no significant association between genetically predicted alcohol consumption and the serum cortisol level. The sex difference may be due to the strength of the instrumental variable in each sex. In men, there was a difference of more than two drinks per day according to the ALDH2 rs671 genotypes, while in women the difference was lower than 0.2 drinks per day. Therefore, the rs671 polymorphism may be a weak instrumental variable for MR in women. The ‘weak instrument’ problem must be considered when interpreting the results. This problem occurs when the association of the instrumental variable and phenotype is not strong statistically. The generally used criterion for a weak instrument is an F statistic less than 10 in the regression model of phenotype on genotype. Although the F statistics was 207.5 in men and 32.79 in women, the satisfaction of criteria means that the study results are less biased below a certain level and does not mean that there is no bias. To assess potential bias, the sensitivity analysis was conducted of the population excluding ex-drinkers.<SEP>It is not fully known how drinking affects the HPA axis in humans, but some biological explanations have been based on preclinical experiments. When an organism is exposed to stressful situations, the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) secretes corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone. Finally, cells in adrenal gland release glucocorticoids. Acute alcohol administration directly elevates PVN cellular activity, the onset of the stress hormone response in a rodent model, and in vitro. In an acute alcohol administration experimental study of healthy people, HPA axis activation occurs when the blood alcohol concentration is ≥ 0.1 µg/dL. When this stressful-like situation due to alcohol ingestion has become chronic, the responsiveness of organs included in the stress hormone response changes. As a result, a blunted HPA axis response to stress challenge and upregulation of the central CRF pathway occur, suggesting elevated HPA axis hormone concentrations. In an experimental study that investigated the interaction between acute alcohol administration and chronic alcohol use, short-term ethanol administration increased the cortisol level in the non-alcoholic population, but not in heavy drinkers or alcoholics. HPA axis responses are prominent when the blood alcohol concentration exceeds a certain level, although the threshold is influenced by chronic drinking, genetic factors, and so on. Some chronic drinkers develop the clinical features of Cushing's syndrome.<SEP>There are some limitations to this study. First, the serum cortisol level changes with the circadian rhythm. In the observation study, the cortisol level had a nadir around midnight and peaked at around 8:30 am. In this study, serum was obtained between 8:00 and 9:00 am, so the peak cortisol level was measured. Second, the alcohol intake may not have been measured accurately because alcohol consumption was measured using a standard glass and by roughly converting it according to beverage type.<SEP>In conclusion, the MR study showed that the genetically predicted alcohol consumption was positively associated with elevated serum cortisol levels in Korean men. This suggests a causal relationship between alcohol consumption and cortisol levels.<SEP>Disclosure: The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.<SEP>Conceptualization: Shin MH.<SEP>Formal analysis: Yang JH, Shin MH.<SEP>Investigation: Kweon SS, Lee YH, Choi SW, Ryu SY, Nam HS, Park KS, Kim HY, Shin MH.<SEP>Methodology: Shin MH.<SEP>Supervision: Shin MH.<SEP>Writing - original draft: Yang JH, Shin MH.<SEP>Writing - review & editing: Yang JH, Kweon SS, Lee YH, Choi SW, Ryu SY, Nam HS, Park KS, Kim HY, Shin MH.<SEP>Author Contributions:  ",15109,['EATBTS']
32183743,"Background<SEP>Hyperuricemia (HUA) is defined by high serum uric acid (sUA) levels due to an imbalance of purines from food, urate synthesis, and/or urate excretion into the urine or gastrointestinal tract, which is related to gout, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. The cause of HUA is multi-factorial, including age, gender, obesity, diet, alcohol consumption, insulin resistance, hypertension, and medication. sUA, however, is under strong genetic control, and more than ten sUA associated genes have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including three main risk genes: ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), glucose transporter type 9 (GLUT9, also known as SLC2A9), and urate anion transporter 1 (URAT1, also known as SLC22A12).<SEP>ABCG2 encodes a high-capacity urate efflux transporter. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2231142 (Q141K) located in exon 5 of ABCG2 leads to a Glu141Lys amino acid substitution. The T allele of rs2231142 has been associated with increased serum urate levels, and its frequency is approximately 3-fold higher in East Asian populations compared to European populations. The ABCG2 rs2231142 SNP is reported to be the most significant genetic variant associated with HUA and gout in East Asia compared to other sUA-risk genes. However, the association between HUA and the ABCG2 variants interacting with SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 has not been investigated in a Chinese population. In addition, few studies have identified an association of lifestyle-related risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, Aspirin use) or disease conditions (hypertension, obesity) with ABCG2 rs2231142-related HUA risk. Therefore, in this study, we determined if SNPs of three major sUA genes (ABCG2 rs2231142, SLC2A9 rs3733591, and SLC22A12 rs893006), individually and/or in combination were associated with HUA risk and sUA level. We also investigated the association between HUA and cardiovascular risk factors within the ABCG2 risk allele carriers, to better understand interactions of gene-cardiovascular risk factors and to develop personalized treatment strategies for ABCG2 rs2231142-related HUA.","Methods<SEP>Ethics statement<SEP>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xuanwuu Hospital (Beijing, China) and all participants signed informed consent before enrolling into this study.<SEP>Study design and subjects<SEP>Subjects were recruited from the Beijing Community-dwelling Study on Aging cohort between 2015 and 2016. The study was designed to explore the health status in older adults. Using a stratified multiphase sampling design, a total of 1260 individuals who included representative samples from the urban district in Beijing were enrolled. Subjects with missing sUA data (n = 5) or DNA sequencing data (n = 30), as well as history of severe chronic kidney disease [endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) < 30 ml/min] (n = 19) were excluded. To ensure that estrogen did not influence sUA levels in females, we recruited both males (n = 699) and females (n = 507) who were ≥ 65 years old. HUA was defined as a serum urate acid level > 417 μmol/L (7.0 mg/dl) in males and > 357 μmol/L (6.0 mg/dl) in females according to a previous study. The criteria for the controls included individuals without history and/or current treatment of HUA or gout, and sUA levels of ≤417 (7.0 mg/dl) in males and ≤ 357 μmol/L (6.0 mg/dl) in females.<SEP>Collection of laboratory test and physical examination data<SEP>Venous blood was collected from each subject in the morning after fasting for at least 12 h. Samples were analyzed for fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and sUA using IPE (www.ipe-bio.com) in Beijing. sUA levels were assessed using uricase/peroxidase methods. Resting blood pressure (BP) was measured by well-trained personnel using the auscultatory method and the phase I and V (sudden reduction/disappearance) Korotkoff sounds to identify systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. Each participant was seated comfortably in a quite environment for 5 min before BP measurements. BP levels were measured in both upper arms at the first office visit to detect possible difference between arms, and the arm with the higher BP value was used for subsequent measurements with an appropriate cuff size for the arm circumference. Three BP measurements were recorded within 1–2 min of each measurement and the average of the three measurements was used for data analysis. The office hypertension was defined as office SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg in any individual, and subjects who had been receiving antihypertensive medication were also defined as hypertensive. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed based on the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) / height (m2) and obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2. High levels of TG and LDL were defined as ≥1.7 mmol/L and ≥ 3.4 mmol/L, respectively, and low HDL levels were defined as < 1.0 mmol/L according to a previous study. Other lifestyle information, such as tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, was recorded through face-to-face questionnaires.<SEP>SNP selection and genotyping<SEP>Three SNPs, including ABCG2 rs2231142, SLC2A9 rs3733591, and SLC22A12 rs893006, were selected based on previously reported associations with sUA levels, especially in Asian populations. The minor allele frequencies (MAF) of these selected SNPs were ≥ 5% in Chinese populations according to the 1000 Genomes Projects (http://www.internationalgenome.org/) database.<SEP>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of each participant using a standard procedure, genotyped for the three SNPs using the TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and then analyzed for allelic discrimination using the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System and SDS software (Applied Biosystems).<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>Continuous variables are summarized as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using Student’s t-test for normal data distributions or the Mann-Whitney U test for non-normal data distributions. Comparisons of categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-square test. The association of risk allele frequencies of these three loci with HUA was analyzed based on gender. The association between the risk allele of three loci and sUA level or HUA was analyzed using the linear regression model and logistical model, respectively, with justification for age, gender, hypertension, serum creatinine, BMI, TG, HDL, and LDL. The association of three SNP genotypes and sUA levels was analyzed using the one-way ANOVA with a posthoc Bonferroni test and a Bonterroni correction of p < 0.0167 (equivalent to p < 0.05 significance). The genetic risk score of individuals was generated by counting the number of risk alleles of high sUA levels in the study population, ranging from 0 to 6 (C allele of SLC2A9 rs3733951, T allele of ABCG2 rs2231142, and G allele of SLC22A12 rs893006). The association between genetic risk score and sUA levels was analyzed using a linear regression model after adjusting for the above listed covariates. To assess the effects of cardiovascular risk factors on the risk of HUA associated with the ABCG2 T allele, multiple logistic regression analysis was also conducted. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were then calculated. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.<SEP>Availability of data and materials<SEP>According to the Chinese policy of “National regulation on the management of human genetic resources” released by State Council (Index No. 000014349/2019–00063; Serial No. 171), availability of the data and materials is confidential.<SEP>Ethics approval and consent to participate<SEP>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xuan Wu Hospital (Beijing, China), and all participants signed informed consent before enrolling in this study.<SEP>Consent for publication<SEP>Not Applicable.","Results<SEP>Characteristics of study population<SEP>A total of 1026 individuals, including 699 males and 507 females, were enrolled in this study. The average age of the participants was 76.64 ± 6.40 years (range, 65–94 years) and all were from an elderly Beijing community-dwelling population. The prevalence of HUA was 14.71% in the study population, with 151 HUA cases and 1055 controls. Table 1 indicates that individuals in the HUA group had higher levels of serum creatinine, TG, LDL, and BMI, but lower levels of HDL, compared to controls (p < 0.05). The percentage of hypertensive patients in the HUA cases was also higher compared to the control group (47.7% vs 38.8%, p = 0.041), but there was no significant difference in SBP and DBP between the two groups, which may be related to hypertension treatment (e.g., 31.8% of the HUA cases and 18.8% of the controls, p = 4.9 × 10− 5). However, the ratio of diuretics was relatively low and did not reach statistical significance between the two groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference in FBG, alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, or history of diabetes between the case and control groups. <SEP>Distribution of ABCG2, SLC2A9, and SLC22A12 polymorphisms between two groups<SEP>The three tested SNPs (SLC2A9 rs3733591, ABCG2 rs2231142, and SLC22A12 rs893006) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.30, 0.70, and 0.33, respectively). The genotype and allele frequencies of these three SNPs are shown in Table 2 and stratified by gender. In the general population, the genotype frequencies of ABCG2 rs2231142 among HUA cases were 11.9% (T/T), 53.6% (T/G), and 34.4% (G/G), respectively, while the genotype frequencies were 8.0% (T/T), 40.4% (T/G), and 51.7% (G/G) in the controls, respectively. The minor T allele of the ABCG2 variants reached 28.2% in the controls and 38.7% in the HUA cases. The distribution of ABCG2 variants showed statistical significance in males and when combining males and females for the Chi-square test, there was no significant association in females (p = 0.053). The distribution of SLC2A9 rs3733591 was only significantly different in females (p = 0.003), with a frequency of 17.8% for C/C and 52.1% for C/T in the HUA cases. There was no significant difference in genotype frequency of SLC22A12 rs893006 between HUA cases and controls in both males and females. <SEP>Association between risk alleles of uric acid genes with sUA levels and HUA risk<SEP>In all samples, there was a significant association of increased sUA levels (μmol/L) with each copy of risk allele of the three SNPs (Beta = 0.08, p = 0.002 in rs3733591 SLC2A9, Beta = 0.16, p = 6.75 × 10− 9 in rs2231142 ABCG2, Beta = 0.07, p = 0.006 in rs893006 SLC22A12; Table 3). There was also a significant association HUA with the risk alleles of these three SNPs [OR (95% CI): 1.34 (1.03–1.74), p = 0.029 in rs3733591 SLC2A9, OR (95% CI): 1.63 (1.27–2.11), p = 1.65 × 10− 4 in rs2231142 ABCG2]; however, there was no significant association of HUA with SLC22A12 rs893006 variants [OR (95% CI): 1.33 (0.99–1.78), p = 0.061]. After we separated the subjects by gender, the T allele of rs2231142 ABCG2 was associated with sUA level and HUA in both males and females (all p < 0.05), but the C risk allele in rs3722591 SLC2A9 was only associated with sUA level and HUA in females. The SLC22A12 rs893006 G risk allele was only associated with sUA level in males. <SEP>Association between different genotypes of three SNPs and sUA level<SEP>sUA level (μmol/L) was associated with the ABCG2 rs2231142 polymorphism in all populations (T/T: 337.46 ± 71.25, T/G: 317.51 ± 80.53, G/G: 287.46 ± 75.13; p = 6.98 × 10− 8) and sUA levels of the G/G genotypes were significantly lower compared with those of the T/T genotypes (p = 4.40 × 10− 6). There was also a significant difference in sUA levels in the G/G and T/T male carriers (G/G vs. T/T: 313.32 ± 73.83 vs 348.20 ± 68.85; p = 0.003) and female carriers (G/G vs T/T: 276.18 ± 71.65 vs 323.32 ± 72.67; p = 2.67 × 10− 4). The sUA level was higher in SLC2A9 C/C carriers of the whole population and females compared with T/T carriers (p = 0.005 and 0.015, respectively), but there was no association in male subjects. There was also no significant difference in sUA levels between each genotype of the SLC22A12 rs893006 polymorphism analyzed using the posthoc Bonferroni test (Table 4). <SEP>Association of sUA levels and genetic risk scores<SEP>The genetic risk score of an individual was generated by counting the number of risk alleles of high sUA levels in the study population, ranging from 0 to 6 (C allele of SLC2A9 rs3733951, T allele of ABCG2 rs2231142, and G allele of SLC22A12 rs893006; Fig. 1). Using linear regression analysis, we found that the mean sUA level in both males and females significantly increased with the number of risk alleles (Beta = 0.17, p = 6.24 × 10− 7 in males and Beta = 0.20, p = 7.39 × 10− 7, respectively). In the whole population, the mean sUA level also increased linearly with the number of risk alleles (Beta = 0.18, p = 1.94 × 10− 12). <SEP>Association between rs2231142 ABCG2 variants and HUA risk according to cardiovascular risk factors<SEP>Table 5 summarizes the association between ABCG2 rs2231142 polymorphisms and HUA risk with or without cardiovascular risk factors. In all study populations, the OR of HUA with each copy of the T allele in rs2231142 increased significantly when accounting for cardiovascular risks (such as obesity, hypertension, higher levels of TG and LDL, and lower levels of HDL) compared to those without cardiovascular risk factors. The OR of HUA with high TG levels and low HDL levels had a strong increase in HUA risk associated with each copy of T alleles in 2,231,142 in males (OR (95% CI): 2.41 (1.06–4.53), p = 0.035 and OR (95% CI): 2.50 (1.12–5.67), p = 0.026, respectively). Among females, the association was statistically significant in individuals with obesity [OR (95% CI): 1.59 (1.04–3.04); p = 0.045], hypertension [OR (95% CI): 1.83 (1.09–3.08); p = 0.021], and high TG levels [OR (95% CI): 2.57 (1.10–6.01); p = 0.030] and LDL levels [OR (95% CI): 1.98 (1.20–3.34); p = 0.008] compared with those with non-cardiovascular risk factors, but not those with low HDL levels (p = 0.156). <SEP>We further assessed the association between cardiovascular risk factors and HUA risk or sUA levels among the ABCG2 rs2231142 T allele carriers (Table 6). BMI and TG levels were associated with higher sUA levels (Beta = 0.21, p = 3.40 × 10− 8 and Beta = 0.24, p = 6.18 × 10− 9, respectively) in the whole population, and this association was also significant in males (Beta = 0.23, p = 1.14 × 10− 5 for BMI and Beta = 0.25, p = 8.95 × 1 0− 6 for TG level, respectively) and females (Beta = 0.20, p = 0.002 for BMI and Beta = 0.24, p = 4.00 × 10− 4 for TG level, respectively). The association of BMI and TG level with HUA risk was also significant in males [OR (95% CI) = 2.01 (1.62–2.50); p = 1.75 × 10− 10 and OR (95% CI) = 1.88 (1.28–2.74); p = 0.001, respectively] and females [OR (95% CI): 1.22 (1.08–1.37); p = 0.001and OR (95% CI): 1.95 (1.26–2.55); p = 0.003, respectively]. However, other cardiovascular risk factors were not associated with sUA level and HUA risk among rs2231142 T allele carriers. ","Discussion<SEP>In the current study, we confirmed that ABCG2 rs2231142 is the most important sUA genetic variant compared to two other sUA genetic polymorphisms, SLC2A9 rs3733591 and SLC22A12 rs893006, in the Chinese population. Our data also showed that the combination of the ABCG2 rs2231142 risk allele with two other sUA genetic variants was significantly associated with an increase in sUA level in an elderly Chinese population. Our data are consistent with findings reported by Torres et al., although the studies included different SNPs for SLC2A9 and SLC22A12. In a single-locus analysis, the SLC22A12 SNP rs893006 was reported to be associated with HUA in Japanese men. This locus was related to sUA levels only in males, but there was no significant association with HUA in males or females in the present study, which was in accordance with the findings of a previous study. SNP rs3733591 in SLC2A9 was also identified as being associated with sUA levels and gout in the Han Chinese population, but the association was only significant in females in our study. However, the combined effect of the alleles on sUA level was enhanced for carriers of these genetic variants, which indicates that three urate transporter genes interact in the cortical cells in renal tubules. Although our study should be validated with a larger cohort, our findings revealed that assessing the combined effect of genetic factors is more valuable for developing a treatment strategy based on inter-individual differences, rather than merely testing for single genotype variants to predict HUA or gout risk.<SEP>Genetic factors play an important role in HUA risk, but these factors do not change in a given individual. Thus, our results further demonstrated that cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, combined with the ABCG2 rs2231142 risk allele, greatly modified the risk of HUA and increased sUA levels. Most importantly, we revealed that ABCG2 rs2231142 T allele carriers with high TG levels have a significantly increased risk of HUA and sUA levels. Associations with sUA levels and lipid metabolism were not clearly reported in a previous study, but Fu et al reported that TG, LDL, and HDL levels were significantly associated with HUA risk (OR = 1.17, 1.20, and 0.62, respectively) in a Chinese community-dwelling population. Another Chinese prospective study suggested that TG level was a significant and independent risk factor for HUA. The associations found in our study were greatly higher than those reported in previous Chinese studies, possibly due to the older population included in our study. Our findings suggest that more attention should be given to controlling serum TG levels and that appropriate diet recommendations or lipid-lowering therapy should be provided to elderly Chinese patients, given the high frequency of the ABCG2 rs2231142 risk allele among Asians.<SEP>The association of hypertension with HUA risk has been inconsistently reported in the literature. In our current study, HUA risk was associated with hypertension, but not with DBP or SBP measured at office visits, which could be mainly due to BP measurements that were possibly affected by anti-hypertension medicine. Furthermore, the proportion of diuretic intake in this the cohort of participations was low and there was no difference between HUA cases and controls; thus, the influence on sUA should be relatively small. Our study also established that HUA risk was increased in ABCG2 rs2231142 risk allele carriers in the hypertensive patients compared to non-hypertension patients. A previously published rodent model demonstrated that hypertension could induce renal arteriosclerosis and tubulointerstitial disease, leading to reduced uric acid excretion and HUA. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association remain to be determined.<SEP>A previous study using a mouse model showed that ABCG2 expression increased significantly, suggesting a link between enhanced urate reabsorption and obesity-associated HUA. Our current data further confirmed that both obese males and females carrying the rs2231142 T allele has an associated increased HUA risk, which was consistent with other Asian population studies. However, a previous study in a European population only showed a significant association in males, not in females, possibly due to ethnic differences. Estrogen levels can affect ABCG2 expression, thus we excluded postmenopausal women to eliminate the effect of estrogen on allelic associations with HUA.<SEP>Our current study does have some limitations. For example, we did not include all cardiovascular risk factors that could impact sUA levels and HUA risk, such as lifestyle and dietary factors. In addition, more samples from different districts need to be included in future analyses to better investigate the association of ABCG2 polymorphisms and other genetic variants and cardiovascular risk factors with the risk of developing HUA.",20486,['EATBTS']
27588450,"Introduction<SEP>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health burden and affects nearly 10% of the global population. Reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function used to define CKD, is associated with premature cardiovascular disease and mortality, acute kidney injury, and progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD). Although individuals of African and Hispanic descent suffer the largest burden of CKD, the largest genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to search for kidney-function loci have been undertaken in populations of European and East Asian ancestry. Many of these loci are characterized by common variant association signals that map to large genomic intervals, which contain many possible causal genes for eGFR, thereby limiting understanding of the downstream pathogenesis of CKD.<SEP>To address this challenge, we have undertaken a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of nine GWASs comprising 71,638 individuals from four ancestries (African American, Hispanic, European, and East Asian), each imputed up to the phase 1 integrated (March 2012 release) multi-ethnic reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project, from the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network (COGENT)-Kidney consortium. With these data, we aimed to (1) assess the evidence for heterogeneity in allelic effects on eGFR for lead SNPs at kidney-function loci across ethnic groups; (2) fine-map these loci by taking advantage of high-density imputation and by leveraging differences in the pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between diverse populations to localize “credible sets” of variants driving eGFR association signals; (3) define potential molecular mechanisms through which eGFR association signals at these loci impact kidney function through overlap of credible variants with genomic annotation; and (4) assess possible markers for biological processes that impact kidney function and CKD in humans through targeted experimentation in model organisms.","Subjects and Methods<SEP>Ethics Statement<SEP>All human research was approved by the relevant institutional review boards and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent.<SEP>Study Overview<SEP>We aggregated five GWASs of individuals of European ancestry (23,553 individuals from Europe, the USA, and Australia), two GWASs of Hispanic Americans (16,325 individuals from the USA), one GWAS of individuals of East Asian ancestry (23,536 individuals from Japan), and one GWAS of African Americans (8,224 individuals from the USA). Study sample characteristics are presented in Table S1.<SEP>Genotyping, Quality Control, and Imputation<SEP>Samples were genotyped with a variety of GWAS arrays, and quality control was undertaken within each study (Table S2). Sample quality control included exclusions on the basis of genome-wide call rate, extreme heterozygosity, sex discordance, cryptic relatedness, and outlying ethnicity. SNP quality control included exclusions on the basis of call rate across samples and extreme deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Non-autosomal SNPs were excluded from imputation and association analysis.<SEP>Within each study, the autosomal GWAS genotype scaffold was first pre-phased with genetic maps from the International HapMap Consortium to model recombination rates. The scaffold was then imputed up to the phase 1 integrated (March 2012 release) multi-ethnic reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project via IMPUTE2 or MaCH/Minimac (Table S2). Imputed variants were retained for downstream association analyses if they attained established GWAS quality control thresholds: IMPUTE2 info ≥ 0.4 or MaCH/Minimac r2 ≥ 0.3.<SEP>Calculation of eGFR and Association Analysis<SEP>Within each study, eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine (mg/dL), with adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity by means of the four-variable MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease) equation to be comparable with published GWASs of kidney function. Within each study, we tested association of eGFR with each variant passing quality control in a linear regression framework under an additive dosage model and with adjustment for study-specific covariates to account for confounding due to population structure (Table S2). Association summary statistics were subsequently corrected in each study for residual population structure through a first round of genomic control where necessary (Table S2).<SEP>Trans-ethnic Meta-analysis<SEP>Association summary statistics were combined across studies via fixed-effects meta-analysis (inverse-variance weighting) implemented in the GWAMA software. Variants passing quality control in fewer than 50% of the total sample size across studies were excluded from the meta-analysis. Association summary statistics from the meta-analysis were then corrected for a second round of genomic control (λGC = 1.028). Heterogeneity in allelic effects between studies at each variant was assessed by means of Cochran’s Q statistic. We extracted association summary statistics for eGFR from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis for previously reported lead SNPs at established GWAS loci.<SEP>LD Calculations<SEP>LD, as measured by the correlation coefficient r2, was calculated on the basis of haplotypes in each ancestry group from the 1000 Genomes Project via LDlink.<SEP>Conditional Analyses<SEP>To assess the evidence for distinct association signals at each locus attaining nominal significance (pCOND < 10−5, Bonferroni correction for ∼5,000 variants per locus) in our trans-ethnic meta-analysis, we performed conditional analysis in a 1 Mb genomic interval flanking the lead SNP. Within each study, we tested association of eGFR with each variant passing quality control in the flanking region in a linear regression framework under an additive dosage model and with adjustment for genotypes at the lead SNP, in addition to other study-specific covariates used in unconditional analysis (Table S2). Association summary statistics were subsequently corrected in each study for residual population structure, via the same genomic control correction employed for unconditional analysis (Table S2). These association summary statistics were combined across studies via fixed-effects meta-analysis (inverse-variance weighting) implemented in GWAMA. Variants passing quality control in less than 50% of the total sample size across studies were excluded from the meta-analysis. Association summary statistics from the conditional meta-analysis were then corrected for a second round of genomic control, making use of the same adjustment as defined in the unconditional analysis (λGC = 1.028).<SEP>Association with CKD<SEP>We defined CKD by an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated with the MDRD equation defined above) and/or incidence of ESRD, if available. Any individual who was prospectively initiated on dialysis or received a kidney transplant (self-reported or obtained from medical records or registries) was defined as having ESRD. Individuals who did not develop ESRD at follow-up were considered control subjects. We considered the lead eGFR SNP identified at each locus attaining genome-wide significance in our trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Within each study, we tested association of CKD with each SNP in a logistic regression framework under an additive dosage model and with adjustment for study-specific covariates to account for confounding due to population structure (Table S2). Association summary statistics were combined across studies via fixed-effects meta-analysis (sample size and inverse-variance weighting) implemented in METAL and GWAMA.<SEP>Association with eGFR in Diabetic Individuals from the SUMMIT Consortium<SEP>We considered the lead eGFR SNP at each locus attaining genome-wide significance in our trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We performed a look-up of association summary statistics for eGFR in 13,158 subjects with diabetes (9,197 with type 2 diabetes [T2D] and 3,961 with type 1 diabetes [T1D]) from five studies of individuals of European ancestry from the SUMMIT Consortium. Within each study, the outcome variable was defined as the last measured eGFR, calculated with the MDRD equation (defined above). Each study was imputed up to the phase 1 integrated (March 2012 release) multi-ethnic reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project. Estimated allelic effects on eGFR were obtained from a linear mixed model and implemented in EMMAX with an empirical genetic relationship matrix, assuming an additive dosage of the minor allele and including sex, age at diabetes onset, and duration of diabetes as covariates. Association summary statistics for eGFR were combined across studies via fixed-effects meta-analysis (inverse-variance weighting) implemented in GWAMA. Combined allelic effect estimates across studies were reported for T1D and T2D subjects, both separately and for all diabetic individuals combined. Heterogeneity in allelic effects between T1D and T2D subjects at each variant was assessed by means of Cochran’s Q statistic, as implemented in GWAMA.<SEP>For lead SNPs, we tested for a difference in the allelic effect on eGFR in the general population (from our trans-ethnic meta-analysis) and in diabetic indivuduals (combined T1D and T2D from the SUMMIT Consortium) by using a two-sample Z-test.<SEP>MANTRA Fine Mapping and Credible Set Construction<SEP>We performed trans-ethnic fine mapping of each locus in a 1 Mb genomic interval flanking the lead SNP. Association summary statistics for each variant in the flanking region were combined across studies with a Bayesian hybrid of fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis, as implemented in MANTRA. MANTRA allows for heterogeneity in allelic effects between ancestry groups arising as a result of differences in the structure of LD between diverse populations by assigning studies to clusters according to a Bayesian partition model of relatedness between them, defined by pairwise genome-wide mean allele frequency differences (Figure S1). MANTRA has been demonstrated, both empirically and by simulation, to improve fine-mapping resolution, as compared to either a fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis. Variants passing quality control in less than 50% of the total sample size across studies were excluded from the fine-mapping analysis.<SEP>We calculated the posterior probability that the jth variant, πCj, is driving the association signal at each locus bywhere the summation is over all variants in the flanking interval. In this expression, Λj is the MANTRA Bayes factor in favor of association from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis. For each distinct association signal, a 99% credible set was then constructed by (1) ranking all variants according to their Bayes factor, Λj, and (2) including ranked variants until their cumulative posterior probability exceeds 0.99.<SEP>Genomic Annotation<SEP>For each locus attaining genome-wide significance in our trans-ethnic meta-analysis, we obtained genomic annotations of all single-nucleotide variants in a 1 Mb interval flanking the lead SNP. We utilized the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP, version 2.7), based on the Ensembl transcript set (version 69). By default, the VEP reports all possible annotations (transcript- and gene-specific) for each variant. We therefore prioritized annotations by considering the most severe consequence of all those reported. We then calculated the total posterior probability of driving association signals for each consequence across loci.<SEP>Regulatory Annotation<SEP>We collected genomic annotations from three sources. First, we obtained regulatory chromatin states from the Epigenome Roadmap Project for 93 cell types after removing five cancer cell lines. For each cell type, we pooled enhancer (EnhA and EnhWk) and promoter (TssA and TssFlnk) elements into one annotation. Second, we obtained 145 non-redundant DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) from the ENCODE Project by retaining only one dataset for cell types with multiple assayed samples. Third, we obtained chromatin immuno-precipitation sequence (ChIP-seq) binding sites for 165 transcription factors: 161 proteins from the ENCODE Project and additional factors assayed in primary pancreatic islets. This resulted in a total of 403 annotations for downstream enrichment analyses. For each annotation, we considered variants passing quality control and mapping within 1 Mb of the lead SNP attaining genome-wide significance in the trans-ethnic meta-analysis.<SEP>We first tested the effect of each annotation on the log odds of the posterior probability of driving eGFR association signals in a logistic regression model. For each variant, we encoded overlap with the tested annotation as a binary indicator (1 if variant overlaps annotation, 0 otherwise). The regression model also incorporated binary indicators of genic annotations as covariates, as well as a categorical variable for locus membership. Specifically,where πCj is the posterior probability that the jth variant drives the eGFR association; αi denotes an intercept for the ith locus and Lij is a binary indicator of membership of the jth variant in the ith locus; βk denotes the effect of the kth annotation and xkj is a binary indicator of overlap of the jth variant with the kth annotation; and γ3′ UTR, γ5′ UTR, γEXON and γTSS denote the effects of 3′ UTRs, 5′ UTRs, coding exons, and the region within 1 kb upstream of GENCODE transcription start site (TSS) annotations, respectively, and xj3′ UTR, xj5′ UTR, xjEXON and xjTSS are binary indicators of overlap of the jth variant with these annotations. The SE of the effect of the kth annotation, βk, was evaluated with a robust sandwich variance estimator.<SEP>Using fGWAS software, we then tested for the effect of each annotation by using the Bayes factor in favor of association. We included coding exons, 3′ UTRs, 5′ UTRs, and the region within 1 kb upstream of the TSS in the model for each annotation. We obtained the estimated effect and 95% confidence interval (CI) from this model and considered an annotation enriched if the 95% CI did not overlap zero.<SEP>Drosophila melanogaster Salt-Sensitivity Assay<SEP>Four y1w1 virgin females were mated with two males each of the genotypes y1w1/Y, y1w1/Y; locoEY-P283/TM3 Sb or y1w1/Y; locod06164 in rearing vials on standard cornmeal/yeast/molasses food (prepared in a central kitchen at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The y1w1 isogenic control, in which all loci had been previously homozygosed, and to which loco mutants had been backcrossed for six generations, were obtained from Dr. Yongkyu Park (Rutgers New Jersey Medical School). Separately, to obtain highly heterozygous progeny (heterogenic), virgin females from the A.R.R. lab’s wBerlin strain were mated with males of genotypes y1w1/Y, y1w1/Y; locoEY-P283/TM3 Sb or y1w1/Y; locod06164, as above. Adults were cleared from rearing vials on rearing day eight. Ten female progeny from each vial were collected within 1–3 days of eclosion and placed on food containing various concentrations of added NaCl. Each experimental vial contained flies from a single rearing vial. The number of dead flies in each vial was counted daily. Flies were transferred to fresh medium after day five, and again after day ten for the heterogenic flies. For each concentration of experimental medium, 225 g Applied Scientific Jazz-Mix Drosophila Food (Fisher, cat. no. AS-153) was added to 500 mL deionized water with constant stirring. Flasks were then placed on a hot plate at 350°C with constant stirring and heated to a slow boil (about 20–25 min). The heat was then turned off, 4M NaCl was added to achieve varying concentrations of added NaCl, and total volume adjusted to 900 mL with deinonized water. Medium was dispensed in 3–4 mL aliquots in polystyrene vials. All crosses and assays were performed at room temperature (∼22°C–23°C) and ambient humidity.<SEP>We estimated the effect of the mutations on salt sensitivity by applying a Cox proportional hazards model on the fly survival data. The outcome was survival time, and at the end of the follow-up period, all living flies were censored. The data for each genetic background (heterogenic or isogenic) and NaCl concentration were analyzed separately. We estimated the effect on the hazard ratio of genotype (each mutation versus control as baseline). To account for intra-vial correlation, we used robust sandwich variance estimators in a generalized estimating equation (GEE)-like model that treats members of each vial as associated with a single cluster. Analyses were performed with the R “survival” package.<SEP>Mouse Renal Expression Study<SEP>129S6 mice were purchased from Taconic Biosciences and were maintained on a 12 hr light-dark cycle with free access to standard chow and water in the animal facility of the University of Virginia. Only male mice at 12 weeks of age were used. High-salt diet (HSD, 6% NaCl) in pellets was purchased from Harlan Teklad and administered in place of normal chow for two weeks. Experiments were carried out in accordance with local and NIH guidelines. To induce CKD, mice were subjected to sub-total nephrectomy (Nx) under 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia, the right kidney was removed, and the upper branch of the two main branches of the left renal artery were ligated to impede blood supply to the upper half of the kidney as previously reported.<SEP>Renal mRNA was extracted at the end of 2 weeks of HSD, or at 12 weeks after sub-total Nx. Real-time RT-PCR was performed as previously described with the primers listed in Table S3. Fluorescence detection was accomplished with Sybr Green and the iCYcler system (Bio-Rad). mRNA expression was normalized against mRNA expression of the Hprt housekeeping gene, and the mean at baseline was used as the reference for determination of relative expression across conditions.","Results<SEP>Identification of Loci Associated with Kidney Function across Ancestry Groups<SEP>We identified 20 loci attaining genome-wide-significant evidence of association with eGFR (p < 5 × 10−8) in trans-ethnic meta-analysis (Table 1, Figure S2). These loci have been previously reported in ethnic-specific GWASs of individuals with European and East Asian ancestry (Table S4). They include two loci discovered in a recently published meta-analysis of European ancestry GWASs: LRP2 ([MIM: 600073] rs57989581, p = 5.6 × 10−10) and NFATC1 ([MIM: 600489] rs8096658, p = 1.3 × 10−8). Previously reported lead SNPs at an additional 21 established kidney-function loci attained nominal evidence of association (p < 0.05) with eGFR, with consistent direction of effect (Table S4).<SEP>As expected, lead SNPs were common across ancestry groups at all 20 loci, with each displaying modest effects on eGFR (Table S5). Despite substantial variability in allele frequencies between ancestry groups, we observed no evidence of trans-ethnic heterogeneity in allelic effects on eGFR for any lead SNP (Table 1, Table S5). Through conditional analyses (Table S6), we observed no evidence of multiple distinct signals of association for eGFR at any locus (pCOND < 10−5, Bonferroni correction for ∼5,000 variants per locus). Taken together, these data are consistent with a single variant driving association signals in each locus; each variant is shared across ancestry groups and has homogeneous effects on eGFR in diverse populations. However, we recognize that larger multi-ethnic samples will be required to detect lower frequency, population-specific distinct association signals of modest effect on kidney function.<SEP>Impact of Lead eGFR SNPs on CKD and Kidney Function in Diabetic Individuals<SEP>We assessed the impact on CKD of lead SNPs at the 20 eGFR loci in a subset of individuals (up to 3,976 cases and 55,904 controls) contributing to our trans-ethnic meta-analysis (Table S7). We defined CKD by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or incidence of ESRD. For all 20 lead SNPs, the eGFR-decreasing allele was associated with increased risk of CKD. Eleven of the lead SNPs demonstrated evidence of association with CKD at nominal significance (p < 0.05), and the strongest signals were observed at UNCX (rs62435145, p = 2.2 × 10−7), ALMS1 ([MIM: 606844] rs7587577, p = 3.1 × 10−6), and PDILT-UMOD ([MIM: 191845] rs77924615, p = 4.0 × 10−6).<SEP>We also investigated the impact of the lead SNPs on eGFR in GWASs of individuals with diabetes for whom there are different mechanisms for loss of renal function, such as diabetic nephropathy. We obtained association summary statistics for eGFR in 13,158 subjects of European ancestry with diabetes (9,197 with T2D and 3,961 with T1D) from the SUMMIT Consortium (Table S8). Consistent with previous reports, allelic effects on eGFR in diabetic individuals and our trans-ethnic meta-analysis of individuals from the general population were homogeneous (Figure S3). There was nominal evidence of association with eGFR (p < 0.05), with the same direction of effect, at seven loci, and the strongest signals were observed at PDILT-UMOD (p = 6.9 × 10−6), PRKAG2 ([MIM: 602743] p = 0.00013) and NFATC1 (p = 0.00045).<SEP>Fine Mapping of eGFR Loci<SEP>We next sought to localize variants driving eGFR association signals in each of the 20 loci attaining genome-wide significance in our trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We utilized trans-ethnic fine mapping implemented in MANTRA, taking advantage of increased sample size and the expectation that patterns of LD vary between diverse populations. We derived credible sets of variants mapping within 500 kb of the lead SNP at each locus that together account for 99% of the posterior probability (πC) of driving the association signal (Table S9). Smaller credible sets, in terms of the number of SNPs they contain, or the genomic interval that they cover, thus correspond to more precise fine-mapping. The 99% credible set at the PDILT-UMOD locus included a single variant (rs77924615, πC>0.999), which maps to an intron of PDILT. This variant has previously been reported as driving the primary association signal for CKD at the PDILT-UMOD locus through whole-genome sequencing and long-range haplotype imputation into 194,286 Icelandic individuals with serum creatinine measurements. We also observed precise localization, defined by a 99% credible set including no more than five variants (Table S10), at a five additional loci: NFATC1 (two variants, mapping to 0.4 kb), SLC34A1 ([MIM: 182309] two variants, mapping to 0.6 kb), GCKR ([MIM: 600842] three variants, mapping to 11.7 kb), DCDC5-MPPED2 ([MIM: 612321, 600911] four variants, mapping to 27.9 kb), and PIP5K1B ([MIM: 602745] five variants, mapping to 3.5 kb).<SEP>Integration of Genetic Fine-mapping and Genomic Annotation<SEP>To gain insight into the mechanisms through which association signals at the 20 GWAS loci attaining genome-wide significance in our trans-ethnic meta-analysis impact eGFR, we began by obtaining genomic annotations for all single-nucleotide variants mapping within 500 kb of lead SNPs. Across all 20 loci, only 5.4% of the posterior probability of driving association signals was annotated to coding variants (Table S11), the majority of which was accounted for by GCKR p.Pro446Leu (rs1260326, πC = 0.938). This missense variant has been shown, functionally, to result in increased de novo triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis and export and decreased plasma glucose concentrations, all of which have been associated with risk of CKD, making GCKR the likely effector transcript for eGFR at this locus. However, outside of the GCKR locus, variants mapping to non-coding sequence accounted for more than 99.4% of the probability of driving eGFR association, suggesting that these signals are most likely to be mediated by effects on gene regulation.<SEP>We next investigated whether genomic annotations of regulatory chromatin state for 93 cell types, DHSs for 145 cell types, and ChIP-seq binding sites for 165 transcription factors were predictive of posterior probability of driving association signals across the 20 loci (Figure 1, Table S12). We observed significant effects (p < 0.00012, Bonferroni correction for 403 annotations) on posterior probability for variants in kidney DHSs, including adult renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs; p = 3.4 × 10−8), renal cortical epithelial cells (HRCEs; p = 4.7 ×10−7), and fetal kidney cells (p = 8.8 × 10−6). We also observed significant effects on posterior probability for transcription-factor binding sites, most notably for HDAC8 (p = 1.1 × 10−14). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in kidney function and development, and HDAC inhibitors could be promising in the treatment of kidney disease. We repeated our analyses by using fGWAS (Figure S4, Table S12) and observed strong correlation in the ranking of enriched annotations (r2 = 0.93). These results highlight that variants driving association signals with eGFR are more likely to be co-localized with annotated elements in kidney cells, thereby suggesting that gene regulation in disease-relevant tissues is a likely mechanism by which GWAS loci impact CKD.<SEP>Lead SNPs that, by themselves, accounted for more than 80% of the posterior probability of driving association signals overlapped an enriched annotation at five loci (Table S13). In particular, at the SLC34A1 locus, rs35716097 (πC = 0.946) overlapped DHSs in RPTECs and HRCEs, as well as a binding site for HDAC8, while at the NFATC1 locus, rs8096658 (πC = 0.877) overlapped fetal kidney cell DHSs (Figure S5). At both of these loci, the lead SNPs were also expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for NFATC1 and RGS14 (MIM: 602513; at the SLC34A1 locus) in multiple tissues (Table S13), highlighting these genes as likely effector transcripts through which eGFR association signals are mediated. NFATC1 plays a central role in inducible gene transcription during immune response and is a downstream target of the transplant immunosuppression drug cyclosporine A. RGS14 encodes a member of the regulator of G protein signaling family, which modulates downstream effects of Gα subunits and has unknown function in kidneys.<SEP>Experimental Data in Model Organisms<SEP>To provide insight into the role of NFATC1 and RGS14 (at the SLC34A1 locus) in kidney physiology, we examined the function of ancestral orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila genome encodes a single member of the NFAT family, and a previous report has demonstrated that flies with NFAT loss-of-function mutations have increased salt sensitivity, suggesting a role for this gene in ionic or osmotic regulation. The closest RGS14 ortholog in Drosophila melanogaster is loco, for which reduced expression is associated with longer lifespan and stress resistance. We thus conducted experiments aimed at characterizing a role for loco loss-of-function variants in salt sensitivity. We compared survival of two independently derived heterozygous loco mutants (y1w1; locod06164/+ and y1w1; locoEY-P283/+) with isogenic y1w1 controls after supplementing their diet with varying NaCl concentrations for 8 days (Figure 2). There was very little mortality of any of the genotypes on non-NaCl-supplemented food, indicating no baseline differences in viability over the time period tested. However, we observed significantly improved survival of the heterozygous loco mutants over controls on NaCl-supplemented food (Figure 2, Table S14), thereby indicating a role for this gene in resistance to salt stress. To exclude the effects of inbreeding depression on our findings, we also repeated our experiments with the same strains on a heterogenic background. As expected, the hybrid heterogenic strains were less salt susceptible than the isogenic strains, but the loco mutants remained salt-resistant when compared to controls of a similar genetic background (Figure 2, Table S14).<SEP>To further investigate the role of NFATC1 and RGS14 in kidney function, we used the 129S6 mouse strain that is salt-sensitive and susceptible to glomerulosclerosis. We compared the renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 and Rgs14 at baseline versus (1) after a 2-week exposure to high-salt diet and (2) at 12 weeks after CKD induced by sub-total nephrectomy. Compared to baseline condition, Rgs14 was significantly decreased (∼75%, p = 0.01) during high-salt exposure (Figure 3). In the CKD model, Rgs14 expression was also reduced and approached statistical significance (p = 0.06). The renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 was also significantly decreased (∼50%, p = 0.03) during high-salt exposure and trended down in CKD (p = 0.31). Although we cannot establish cause and effect, these data illustrate that the expression of both genes is altered during disease states.","Discussion<SEP>We have undertaken a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of GWASs of eGFR, supplemented by imputation up to the phase 1 integrated (March 2012 release) multi-ethnic reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project. With these high-density imputed data, we identified 20 loci at genome-wide significance for eGFR through trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Despite improved coverage of low-frequency variation offered by high-density imputation, lead SNPs were common across ancestry groups at all 20 of these kidney-function loci. There was also minimal evidence of trans-ethnic heterogeneity in allelic effects on eGFR at lead SNPs at kidney-function loci, thereby arguing against the “synthetic association” hypothesis. It is highly unlikely that eGFR association signals at these kidney-function loci reflect unobserved lower frequency causal alleles with larger effects because (1) rare variants are unlikely to have arisen before human population migration out of Africa and thus are not anticipated to be widely shared across diverse populations and (2) LD with these variants is expected to be highly variable between ethnicities.<SEP>Our conditional analyses did not provide evidence for multiple distinct eGFR association signals, which is consistent with a single causal variant at each of the 20 eGFR loci. However, we recognize that conditional analyses evaluate the evidence for residual association at the locus that cannot be ascribed to the lead SNP and do not provide a formal framework to test for the presence of multiple causal variants, for example, that are in strong LD with each other and reside on the same haplotype. Furthermore, larger sample sizes will be required to detect distinct association signals defined by common variants of modest effect or low-frequency variants that might be specific to particular ethnic groups.<SEP>As with most previous GWASs of kidney function, our study was limited to a single measure of eGFR for each participant. We also did not adjust for diabetes or hypertension in our analyses given that these conditions are potential mediators or modifiers of the SNP-eGFR associations. However, despite ethnic differences in the prevalence of these conditions, we observed no evidence of heterogeneity in allelic effects on eGFR between ancestry groups. Exploration of context-dependent effects should be considered in future studies, for example, by using gene-environment interaction or mediation analyses.<SEP>Given our observation that eGFR association signals are shared across ancestry groups, we next sought to take advantage of the differential patterns of LD across diverse populations to fine-map kidney-function loci. Credible-set variants mapped predominantly to non-coding sequence, suggesting that eGFR association signals are most likely to be mediated by effects on gene regulation, in agreement with previous reports for other complex human traits. Through integration of genetic fine-mapping data with information from regulatory annotation resources, we have demonstrated significant enrichment of variants driving eGFR association signals with DHSs in multiple kidney cell types. Overlap with these enriched annotations could be used as a prior model for eGFR association signals, genome-wide, to improve power for discovery of additional kidney-function loci and further enhance trans-ethnic fine-mapping efforts.<SEP>Lead SNPs at kidney-function loci overlapping enriched annotations included eQTL for NFATC1 and RGS14 (at the SLC34A1 locus) in multiple tissues, pointing to likely effector transcripts through which these eGFR association signals are mediated. We have established that loss-of-function mutations in ancestral orthologs of both genes in Drosophila melanogaster are associated with response to salt stress. Although salt sensitivity has not been directly correlated with variation in eGFR in humans, it has been associated with albuminuria, elevated creatinine, and the subsequent development of hypertension, suggesting the relevance of this trait to kidney function. Indeed, in animal models, salt sensitivity is tightly linked with a blunted tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) or impaired increase in GFR after salt loading. Consistent with this, we demonstrated that renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 and Rgs14 in a salt-sensitive mouse model was reduced after exposure to a high-salt diet and induced CKD. In parallel with the findings in Drosophila melanogaster, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the capacity to reduce expression of Rgs14 and Nfatc1 determines the extent of the response to stress. Another possible mechanism suggested by our results in Drosophila is a role for oxidative stress, to which RGS14 ortholog mutants are resistant, and which has been implicated in mammalian salt sensitivity. Establishing the functional role of these genes in salt sensitivity, TGF, GFR, oxidative stress, and CKD will require targeted in vivo studies using knockout and/or transgenic mouse models.<SEP>In conclusion, our study demonstrates the utility of trans-ethnic fine mapping through integration of GWASs of diverse populations with genomic annotation from relevant tissues to define molecular mechanisms by which association signals exert their effect, thereby offering an exciting opportunity to elucidate the pathophysiology of complex human diseases.",34175,['EATBTS']
15207057,"Campylobacter is a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in industrialized and developing countries worldwide. Most Campylobacter infections need not be treated with antimicrobial agents. However, in a subset of patients Campylobacter may cause severe complications and increased risk for death and therefore requires treatment. A recent Danish study has shown that patients with Campylobacter infections have higher acute- and long-term death rates than controls after coexisting conditions were taken into account. The drug of choice is a macrolide (e.g., erythromycin or a newer agent) for treatment of enteric Campylobacter infections after the microbiologic diagnosis. However, for the empiric treatment of adults with suspected bacterial gastroenteritis, the drug of choice typically includes a fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin) because of their activity against almost all enteric bacterial pathogens. Antimicrobial drug resistance in Campylobacter infections, in particular to quinolones, has increased dramatically in many countries during the 1990s as reviewed by Engberg et al.. According to a recent published report by World Health Organization, the sources of antimicrobial drug–resistant Campylobacter strains and the clinical impact of such strains need to be determined.<SEP>We conducted a 1-year prospective study to address the prevalence of macrolide and quinolone resistance in human Campylobacter isolates. Human isolates were compared with isolates from retail food products and broiler chickens. A systematic approach integrating standardized epidemiologic, antimicrobial susceptibility, and typing data was used. We also conducted a case-comparison study to identify risk factors associated with acquiring quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infections.","Materials and Methods<SEP>Surveillance and Susceptibility Testing of Campylobacter Isolates<SEP>The study included all culture-positive Campylobacter infections from May 1, 2001, through June 10, 2002, from two counties with a catchment area of approximately 1.1 million persons (approximately one fifth of the Danish population). The county of Copenhagen, a metropolitan residential area, has a population of 619,000, and the county of Funen, an island with both urban and rural areas, has a population of 472,000. Because of inconsistencies in the patient enrolment from the county of Funen during May and June 2002, patients from this county who were infected after April 31, 2002, were excluded. Epidemiologic data were captured on self-completed standardized patient questionnaires forwarded by the Danish Zoonosis Centre. Patients were interviewed about clinical symptoms, travel history, and exposures to food, water, and animals in the 7 days before illness onset. Completed questionnaires were returned to the Danish Zoonosis Centre and linked with microbiologic data.<SEP>All isolates included in the study were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid and erythromycin. All human isolates from the county of Copenhagen and isolates obtained from retail food products and broiler chickens were screened by a disk-diffusion test using Oxoid disks on 5% blood agar plates. On the basis of zone sizes, this method grouped the isolates in two well-separated populations of susceptible and resistant isolates with both antimicrobial drugs. The few isolates that fell between these populations were retested by using the standardized tablet diffusion and E-test procedures described previously, with the modifications that resistance to nalidixic acid was defined as an MIC >64 mg/L for the MIC method and a zone size <27 mm for the tablet method. All human isolates from the county of Funen were tested by the standardized tablet diffusion test with both antimicrobial drugs. Finally, all isolates found to be resistant and sensitive to nalidixic acid from our case-comparison study were retested by both the standardized tablet diffusion and E-test procedure.<SEP>Case-Comparison Study<SEP>In the second half of the study period (from December 1, 2001, to June 10, 2002), characteristics of patients with quinolone-resistant and quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni infections were compared. Each patient with a resistant isolate was matched with two randomly selected patients with sensitive isolates. Patients were matched on date of specimen collection.<SEP>Patients answered, either by phone or by mail, a short additional questionnaire, which included questions about use of fluoroquinolones the month before onset of illness, use of fluoroquinolones after onset of illness but before specimen collection, use of antimicrobial drugs after specimen collection, and other clinical information. When patients could not answer questions about exposure to fluoroquinolones before fecal sampling, the information was gathered from their healthcare providers.<SEP>Food and Animal Isolates<SEP>As part of a national surveillance program, food samples from retail outlet stores were analyzed for Campylobacter at the regional food safety authorities, according to accredited methods of the Nordic Committee on Food Analysis. The samples were taken from whole poultry and different cuts of poultry (frozen and fresh), including chicken and turkey. Samples of pork and beef products were also analyzed. Imported as well as domestic food products were sampled.<SEP>As part of a national surveillance program for Campylobacter in broiler chickens, chickens were sampled at slaughter and analyzed for Campylobacter. In this study, isolates from broiler chicken farms located in Funen County were included (one isolate per flock). Copenhagen County does not have any broiler chicken farms.<SEP>Serotyping and Molecular Subtyping of Campylobacter Isolates<SEP>One isolate from the primary isolation on modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA) from each patient, as well as one isolate from each retail food sample and broiler chicken fecal sample were characterized at Statens Serum Institut and the Danish Veterinary Institute. Speciation, serotyping, and RiboPrinting (automated ribotyping) were undertaken as previously described (,), with the following modifications for the RiboPrinting method: 1-µL eye needle was filled with bacterial culture and dissolved in 100 µL sample buffer. Ten microliters of 10 g/L lysozyme was added, and the solution was left at 37°C for 10 min. From this solution, 30 µL was transferred to a sample carrier for heat treatment. The RiboPrinter was run according to the SEC protocol at 37°C for 2 h.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>Conditional logistic regression was applied to calculate a matched odds ratio for the exposure variables. Variables, which reached a significance level of <0.15 in the univariate analysis of the case comparison study, were selected for the multiple logistic regression analysis. Stepwise conditional logistic regression with a backward elimination procedure was conducted to obtain a reduced model. Variables with a p value <0.05 were kept in the model. All excluded variables were retested in the final model. The statistical software SAS Release v.8.00 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and Epi Info version 6.04d (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) were used to analyze the data.","Results<SEP>Surveillance and Resistance<SEP>Of 975 culture-confirmed Campylobacter infections in the study, 177 (18.2%) were infected with a quinolone-resistant isolate, whereas 3 (0.3%) isolates were erythromycin-resistant. Linked microbiologic and epidemiologic data were obtained from 678 (69.5%) patients. In total, 152 (22.4%) patients had been outside Denmark within 1 week before illness, whereas 526 (77.6%) were domestically acquired infections. The three erythromycin-resistant isolates were all C. coli, two of them were also quinolone-resistant, and these were both isolated from travelers returning to Denmark from Spain and Portugal, respectively.<SEP>Quinolone resistance was significantly associated with the origin of infection: 76 (50.0%) of 152 infections among travelers returning to Denmark were quinolone-resistant whereas 52 (9.9%) of 526 of domestically infected patients were infected with a quinolone-resistant strain (p < 0.001) (Table 1). For both C. coli and C. jejuni, a significantly higher proportion of quinolone-resistant infections was found among patients who had been abroad in the week before onset of illness than among patients with domestically acquired infections (risk ratio [RR] 9.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 63.8, p = 0.004 and RR 4.9, CI 3.6 to 6.7, p < 0.001). A higher proportion of C. coli than C. jejuni infections were acquired abroad (48.3% compared with 21.3% of C. jejuni).<SEP>Foreign travel was associated with different prevalences of quinolone resistance, depending on destination (Table 2). No travelers returning from other Scandinavian countries hosted quinolone-resistant Campylobacter isolates, whereas travel to a number of regions and subregions, including southern Europe and Southeast Asia, was significantly associated with a high proportion of quinolone-resistant infections.<SEP>C. jejuni infections and C. coli infections did not differ in severity, as assessed by frequency of diarrhea, blood in stool, abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, mean duration of illness, or admission to hospitals. However, the mean duration of illness was longer for the 86 patients with quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infections and a known duration of illness (median 13.2 days) than for the 381 patients with quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni infections and a known duration of illness (median 10.3 days, p = 0.001). The association with extended length of illness was independent of foreign travel. For domestically acquired infections, the mean duration of illness was 12.4 and 10.4 days for quinolone-resistant and quinolone-sensitive infections, respectively. For comparison, the mean duration of illness for travel-associated infections was 13.9 and 10.3 days for quinolone-resistant and quinolone-sensitive infections, respectively. For C. coli, no difference in mean duration of illness was observed between quinolone-resistant and quinolone-sensitive infections.<SEP>Case-Comparison Study<SEP>From December 1, 2001, to June 10, 2002, 42 patients were infected by quinolone-resistant C. jejuni isolates, and these patients were matched with 84 patients with quinolone-sensitive isolates. No patients were connected on epidemiologic grounds of a recognized outbreak. The patients with quinolone-resistant isolates had a mean age of 33 years (interquartile range 20–45 years), and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.2. For comparison, patients with quinolone-resistant isolates in the larger study, which were not included in the case-comparison study, had a mean age of 31 years (interquartile range 20–45 years), and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.3. No strains changed susceptibility category after being retested. However, one case-patient was shown to be co-infected with two C. jejuni strains with identical serotype and RiboGroup, but with different susceptibility patterns, i.e., one strain was clearly sensitive (MIC of quinolone = 2 mg/L), whereas the MIC of quinolone for the other one was 128 to >256 mg/L on multiple repeated testings. Subsequent nucleotide sequence analysis indicated a normal consensus sequence in the former and a Thr-86 to Ala-86 mutation and three silent mutations in gyrA in the latter. The patient had not been exposed to fluoroquinolones before stool specimen collection.<SEP>Risk factors for a quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infection identified in the univariate analysis and in the multiple logistic regression analysis are presented in Table 3. According to the multiple logistic regression analysis, the only exposures independently associated with an increased risk for quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infection were foreign travel (OR = 16.81), eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey (OR = 19.10), and swimming (OR = 5.01). Eating fresh chicken (of presumably Danish origin) was associated with a decreased risk (OR = 0.04). Age group did not affect the findings (younger or older than 15 years of age) in either the univariate or the multiple logistic regression analysis.<SEP>The case-comparison study identified 12 quinolone-resistant cases that were domestically acquired. However, to determine the sources of infection for the domestically acquired quinolone-resistant infections, an unmatched subanalysis on domestically acquired infections (quinolone-resistant versus quinolone-sensitive) was performed. Infections treated with fluoroquinolones before specimen collection were excluded. In this model, the parameter estimates did not change substantially from the primary model, but because of the lower sample size, the confidence intervals increased, and only eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey had p value <0.05. In 10 (11.9%) of 84 domestically acquired infections, patients reported eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey compared with 4 (9.5%) of 42 infections in persons with travel-related infections.<SEP>Overall, we found information on antimicrobial drugs received by 122 of 126 patients. Forty patients (32.8%) were treated with antimicrobial agents for their campylobacteriosis; of these, 33 patients (27%) received a fluoroquinolone, 6 patients (4.9%) received a macrolide, and 1 patient (1%) received both a fluoroquinolone and a macrolide for the C. jejuni infection.<SEP>Campylobacter Isolates from Retail Food Products and Broiler Chickens<SEP>The human isolates were included in a database and compared with 180 Campylobacter isolates obtained from retail food products (chicken [n = 139], turkey [n = 39], and pork [n = 2]) and 49 isolates from broiler chicken fecal samples obtained from the same geographic area and time period as the human isolates. Most (63%) food isolates were from Danish-bred food animals; the remaining isolates were from imported food from France (n = 48), Italy (n = 7), and the United Kingdom (n = 9). The origin of three chicken isolates was unknown. Of 180 isolates obtained from food products of both domestic and foreign origin, 153 (85%) isolates and 27 (15%) isolates were C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively (Table 1). Thirteen (8.5%) of 153 C. jejuni isolates and 8 (29.6%) of 27 C. coli isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid. Three (2.0%) of 153 C. jejuni isolates and 5 (18.5%) of 27 C. coli isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Two isolates (one C. jejuni and one C. coli) from domestic chicken products were resistant to both antimicrobial agents. A subanalysis of resistance status by origin of 139 retail chicken products (domestic versus imported) showed that 7 (8.0%) of 87 C. jejuni isolates and three (60%) of five C. coli isolates from domestic raised chicken products were resistant to nalidixic acid. Of isolates from imported chicken products, 5 (14.7%) (3 isolates from France and 2 isolates from the United Kingdom) of 34 C. jejuni isolates and 1 (10%) (from France) of 10 C. coli isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid.<SEP>Of 49 isolates from broiler chicken fecal samples, 39 (79.6%) were C. jejuni and 10 (20.4%) were C. coli (Table 1). Two isolates (4.1%) (both C. jejuni) were nalidixic acid–resistant; one was also erythromycin-resistant. Five (10.2%) isolates (four C. jejuni, one C. coli) were erythromycin-resistant.<SEP>Serotyping and Molecular Subtyping of Isolates<SEP>We found 133 combinations of serotypes and RiboGroups (hereafter subtypes) among 496 typed isolates (10 isolates were not tested or nontypeable) from domestically acquired C. jejuni infections (Table 4). Eighteen (13.5%) subtypes were identified exclusively among quinolone-resistant isolates, 102 (76.7%), exclusively among quinolone-sensitive isolates, and 13 (9.8%) among both resistant and sensitive isolates.<SEP>Five of 11 subtypes of quinolone-resistant C. jejuni found among isolates from retail food products, broiler chickens, or both were also found among quinolone-resistant domestically acquired C. jejuni isolates from humans, and 34 of 88 subtypes of quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni found among isolates from retail food products, broiler chickens, or both were also found among quinolone-sensitive domestically acquired C. jejuni isolates from humans.<SEP>Patients with domestically acquired quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni infections were more likely to have a C. jejuni subtype that was also identified among retail food products and broiler chickens than were patients with domestically acquired quinolone-resistant infections (270 of 444 vs. 15 of 51, RR = 2.07, CI 1.34 to 3.18, p < 0.001).","Discussion<SEP>Several studies have proposed a causal relation between the veterinary use of fluoroquinolones in food production and the increase in quinolone-resistant Campylobacter infections in humans (–). However, it has been argued that use of fluoroquinolones in human medicine may be driving the increasing quinolone resistance among human Campylobacter isolates (,). Our study provides additional epidemiologic and microbiologic data to this discussion.<SEP>Our case-comparison study identified three factors to be independently associated with increased risk of attracting a quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infection: foreign travel, eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey, and swimming. Eating fresh chicken was associated with a decreased risk.<SEP>A travel association for quinolone-resistant Campylobacter infection has been reported from numerous countries in recent years (,–). A limitation of most studies, apart from the Minnesota study, is that the epidemiologic information did not include a question on current or recent treatment with fluoroquinolones before stool-specimen collection. Therefore, uncontrolled confounding might have occurred. In our study, treatment with a fluoroquinolone before stool-specimen collection and having a quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infection, though statistically significant in the univariate analysis, was no longer significant in the multivariate analysis (Table 3). This finding suggests that quinolone use in humans is not the major selective force for quinolone resistance among Campylobacter spp. that cause human infections. However, use of fluoroquinolones in human medicine may still, to some degree, contribute to quinolone resistance in Campylobacter. This finding was instructively illustrated in our study: by an error, two strains were recovered from one Campylobacter episode, a fluoroquinolone-sensitive strain obtained from the patient's stool sample on December 7, 2001, and one resistant strain (MIC >256 mg/L) from the same patient's stool sample on December 14, 2001. The second stool specimen was obtained after at least 3 days' treatment with ciprofloxacin. The isolates had the same serotype and RiboGroup, and subsequent sequence analysis showed a Thr-86 to Ile-86 mutation in gyrA, the most common identified mutation in quinolone-resistant C. jejuni field strains. Treatment with quinolones has previously been shown to be associated with isolation of a resistant strain (,–), but this case is, to our knowledge, the first documented clinical case in which the exact mutation is presented by a comparison of pre- and posttreatment gyrA genes. In the study by Smith et al. in Minnesota, human exposure to a fluoroquinolone before stool specimen collection was identified as a risk factor for quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infection, but their study also showed that treatment with a fluoroquinolone before stool culture accounted for a maximum of 15% of resistant isolates in Minnesota during 1996 and 1998. Therefore, fluoroquinolone use in humans can (and did in a small extent in this study) result in emergence of quinolone resistance in the treated patient, but the treated patient is unlikely to be a source of quinolone-resistant Campylobacter for other people, because person-to-person transmission of Campylobacter is not considered epidemiologically important.<SEP>In our study, eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey was rare, but a significant risk factor for both quinolone-resistant infections in general, and for domestically acquired quinolone-resistant infections. The type of fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey was not specified in the questionnaire but could have been duck, goose, or ostrich.<SEP>Swimming was also associated with an increased risk for quinolone-resistant infections. The exposure was frequently reported by travel-related infections (20 [48%] of 42), compared with domestically acquired infections (16 [19%] of 84). Patients were questioned about swimming in pool, ocean, lake, or other places combined. Future studies should specify the type of water more specifically.<SEP>Eating fresh chicken was associated with a decreased risk for quinolone-resistant infections. The fresh chicken was of presumably Danish origin, as most fresh chicken eaten in Denmark is domestically raised. In addition, as travelers often eat at restaurants, where information about whether a served chicken is fresh or has been frozen is normally not available, patients who reported eating fresh chicken were likely to have consumed it in Denmark. This is supported by the fact that of 56 (67%) of 84 domestically acquired infections, patients reported eating fresh poultry compared with 17 (38%) of 42 patients with travel-related infections. Eating poultry is believed to be the primary means of acquiring human campylobacteriosis, although other sources also exist. This corroborates the hypothesis that quinolone-resistant–C. jejuni infections could result from the use of quinolones in animals and in food production. The veterinary antimicrobial drug use hypothesis is supported by the findings of this study and studies by our European and American colleagues that a significantly higher proportion of quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infections occur among patients who had been abroad, often to destinations with recognized high quinolone-resistance in Campylobacter in food animals as well as established high risk of attracting quinolone-resistant human Campylobacter infections, than among domestically acquired infections (Tables 1 and 2) (,,,,–). In Denmark, as part of the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Programme (DANMAP), antimicrobial drug susceptibility in Campylobacter is monitored systematically in food animals, retail food products, and humans as well as use of antimicrobial drugs, including quinolones at food animal species level. Compared to the practice in many other countries, only small amounts of fluoroquinolones are used in broiler chicken production, and during 2002, use of fluoroquinolones decreased significantly after restrictions imposed by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration called for reducing fluoroquinolone use. According to DANMAP surveillance data for 2002, no resistance among C. jejuni to quinolones was found in broiler chickens, and quinolone resistance to C. jejuni was found in only 6% of imported and domestic retail chicken meat. This finding may explain why eating fresh chicken (of presumably Danish origin) was associated with a decreased risk for quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infection in the matched multivariate analysis. Our typing data also support this explanation, because patients with domestically acquired quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni infections were more likely to have a C. jejuni subtype that was also identified among retail food products and broiler chickens than were patients with domestically acquired quinolone-resistant infections.<SEP>A potential limitation of our study is the fact that only one isolate from each retail food sample or broiler fecal sample was characterized. Previous studies have shown that multiple strains of Campylobacter may be recovered. Capturing the diversity of strains may have been helpful in accounting for a higher percentage of human strains, as would analysis of additional food and broiler chicken samples.<SEP>In many countries, including Denmark, fewer Campylobacter infections are identified in the winter months, but among the ones that are, a higher percentage are associated with foreign travel. In the case-comparison study, 30 (71%) of 42 quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infections were associated with foreign travel versus 66 (57%) of 116 quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infections in the larger study (not seasonal). A limitation of our study is therefore its time frame (December–June). The patients with resistant isolates in the case-comparison study were demographically (age and sex) comparable to the group of quinolone-resistant infections from the larger study, which were not included in the case-comparison study.<SEP>In the Minnesota study, a clinical implication of fluoroquinolone-resistance among C. jejuni infections was identified: the duration of diarrhea among patients treated with a fluoroquinolone was significantly longer if the patient had a fluoroquinolone-resistant infection (median 10 days) versus a fluoroquinolone-susceptible infection (median 7 days). We also found significantly longer duration of illness among patients with quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infections (median 13.2 days) compared to that of patients with quinolone-sensitive infections (median 10.3 days). However, as history of antimicrobial treatment was only obtained from the case-comparison proportion of our study, stratifying by treatment to determine whether the negative impact on public health was caused by true treatment failures is not possible.<SEP>We found three macrolide-resistant strains; all were C. coli isolated from travelers returning to Denmark. Our finding is in line with current surveillance data on the level of macrolide resistance in Danish broiler chickens, cattle, and chicken meat. Resistance to macrolides has also been reported at continued low level in a number of other countries and should remain the first drug of choice for verified campylobacteriosis (,).<SEP>In conclusion, the current study found evidence of prolonged duration of illness associated with quinolone resistance and supports the conclusions drawn by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration: human quinolone-resistant Campylobacter infections have increased, and this increase has a negative impact on public health. This study also suggests that in a country with restricted fluoroquinolone use in poultry production, chicken is not a source of domestically acquired quinolone-resistant Campylobacter infections, and that in countries with less restrictive use, poultry is an important source of such infections.

25161819,"Introduction<SEP>Sensation seeking is a personality trait that is characterized by searching for novel and intense experiences and sensations, and a willingness to take risks (be they physical, financial, social, or legal) in order to obtain these experiences (Zuckerman). The genetic heritability for the trait ranges from 40% to 60% (Zuckerman). It is important to identify correlates of sensation-seeking tendencies from a public health perspective because they typically manifest during adolescence and are associated with health behaviors such as alcohol use, early-onset substance use, and cigarette experimentation (Martin et al.; Iacono et al.; Derringer et al.; Wilkinson et al.; Winhusen and Lewis).<SEP>Social disinhibition, one aspect of sensation seeking, is a lack of social restraint that manifests itself in behaviors that disregard social conventions (Iacono et al.; Weafer and Fillmore), such as impolite behavior, extreme emotional outbursts, or breaking rules or laws. Because drug and alcohol use enable socially disinhibited behavior (Fillmore; Weafer and Fillmore), it is not surprising that this aspect of sensation seeking is tied closely to alcohol and cigarette experimentation in adolescents (McGue et al.; Wilkinson et al.), behaviors that have potential long-term consequences for health that are frequently initiated during adolescence and established in young adulthood (Paavola et al.).<SEP>While genetic risk factors for sensation-seeking tendencies as a whole have been examined (Derringer et al.; Terracciano et al.), to the best of the authors' knowledge, few if any genetic studies have been conducted that focus on the specific outcome of social disinhibition. However, a couple of genetic studies have looked at genetic associations with behavioral disinhibition, which is a correlated construct that focuses more on the inability to regulate behavioral responses (McGue et al.). Recently, McGue et al. completed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) examining five indicators of behavioral disinhibition: nicotine, alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence, illicit drugs, and nonsubstance-related behavioral disinhibition. This study found only one SNP (rs1868152) that attained genome-wide significance (P = 5 × 10−8), for the indicator of illicit drug use, but authors did not consider this association significant as they were analyzing five different phenotypes. Importantly, authors did find several other SNPs that could be potential candidates for future studies (McGue et al.). In addition, a study by Schlaepfer et al. found a potential link between PRKCG and behavioral disinhibition.<SEP>In this study, we examined the contribution of over 600 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within candidate genes to social disinhibition among a cohort of Mexican-origin youth in Houston, Texas, adjusting for established demographic and psychosocial risk factors. It is important to understand both the genetic and nongenetic contributions to sensation-seeking behaviors among youth in order to inform the development of programs designed to prevent early smoking and alcohol use.","Materials and Methods<SEP>Participant recruitment<SEP>This study is based on an adolescent cohort, established between May 2005 and December 2006, of 1328 youth aged 11–13 years of age at the time of recruitment. All participants were recruited from households that form a large population-based cohort of Mexican-American households (Mano a Mano Cohort) in the Houston metropolitan area. Detailed descriptions of the Mano a Mano recruitment methodology and the establishment of the nested youth cohort have been published previously (Wilkinson et al.). Briefly, a total of 3000 households with eligible youth were identified from the Mano a Mano cohort database. Of the first 1425 potential participants' parents/legal guardians contacted to inquire about participation in the study, just over 90% enrolled their children in the study (n = 1328 adolescents). This youth cohort is known as the Mexican-American Tobacco Use in Children study (MATCh) (Wilkinson et al.). Only one eligible child per household was recruited to be part of the MATCh cohort; no siblings were selected.<SEP>Data collection<SEP>Participants were interviewed in the home at baseline in 2005–2006, as well as 30 months later, in 2008–2009, following identical procedures. A detailed description of baseline data collection procedures has been published previously (Wilkinson et al.). At baseline, youth participants provided informed assent and their parents provided informed consent. Each consenting participant completed a 5-min personal interview that collected basic demographic data (gender, age, and nativity status [US or Mexico]), and acculturation data (Norris et al.). To prevent parents from overhearing their children's responses, participants completed the majority of the survey on a personal digital assistant (PDA). All participants provided buccal (saliva) samples at baseline for SNP analysis. The data on sensation seeking, most demographic indicators, and psychosocial constructs were collected during 2008–2009. Parental education data for the participants were obtained from the Mano a Mano database, and were self-reported by the parent when the parent joined Mano a Mano. All aspects of this study have been approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and the University of Texas School of Public Health.<SEP>Measures<SEP>The outcome variable in this study was social disinhibition, assessed by a seven-item subscale of the Sensation Seeking Scale for Children (SSSC; Russo et al.). Participants endorse the choice that most describes what they like or feel, for example, “(a) I don't like being around kids who act wild and crazy” or “(b) I enjoy being around kids who sometimes act wild and crazy.” Each response option that reflects social disinhibition is worth 1 point; responses are summed to create a social disinhibition score ranging from 0 to 7 (0—least socially disinhibited, 7—most socially disinhibited). The measure has acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.68).<SEP>In addition to identifying SNPs that are significantly associated with social disinhibition scores among these Mexican-American youth (the exposure variables of interest), demographic and psychosocial risk factors were also examined and included as potential covariates in the model, including age, gender, parental education, level of acculturation, and two other aspects of sensation seeking—thrill and adventure seeking (TAS) and drug and alcohol seeking (DAS). We included TAS and DAS scores as covariates in the analysis because the goal of our analysis was to identify SNPs that might influence social disinhibition independently of these other aspects of sensation seeking. Because increasing age and male gender have both been associated with sensation-seeking behaviors (Wilkinson et al.), age and gender were used as confounders in analyses. Parental education, rather than income, was included as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES), as over 95% participants' parents self-reported their highest level of formal educational attainment, while fewer than 50% reported their household income. Parental educational level was analyzed as a three-level categorical variable (less than high school education, high school graduate, greater than high school education). Acculturation was assessed using four items that ascertain language used when reading, speaking at home, speaking with friends, and thinking (Norris et al.). Responses are made on a 5-point scale ranging from “only Spanish” to “only English.” Each question was scored on a scale of 1–5 and averaged to produce a summary linguistic acculturation score, which ranged from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicated a greater use of English and thus a higher level of acculturation.<SEP>The TAS subscale of the SSSC (Russo et al.) comprised 12 questions. Again, participants endorse the choice that most describes what they like or feel, for example, “(a) I'd never do anything that's dangerous” or “(b) Sometimes I like to do things that are a little scary.” Responses that reflect TAS were assigned 1-point each, and were summed to create a score that ranged from 0 to 12 (higher scores indicate greater thrill and adventure-seeking tendencies). The measure demonstrates very good internal reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.82). The DAS subscale includes seven questions, each with a forced response option, for example, “(a) I would like to try marijuana” or “(b) I would never smoke marijuana.” Responses that reflect DAS are assigned 1-point each, and responses were summed to create a score that ranged from 0 to 7 (higher scores indicate more drug and alcohol seeking tendencies). The DAS subscale also demonstrates good internal reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.73).<SEP>DNA collection<SEP>Participants' saliva samples were collected in Oragene vials (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). DNA extraction was performed using a “Purifier” solution with alcohol precipitation per the manufacturer's protocol. The median yield of DNA from 2 mL of saliva captured in 2 mL of Oragene DNA was 110 μg.<SEP>SNP selection<SEP>Candidate genes were first identified from both published reviews (Kreek et al.) and PubMed searches of human genetic studies using the following key words: sensation seeking, risk taking, gambling, smoking onset, and initiation. Multiple types of genetic studies were reviewed to assemble this list of candidate genes, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), candidate gene studies, and family studies. In addition, four neural pathways were further examined in great detail: the serotonergic, dopaminergic, opioid, and cannabinoid pathways. This list of candidate genes was cross-referenced with the Gene Ontology Database (http://pid.nci.nih.gov/) and the Kegg Pathway database (http://www.genome.jp/) in order to confirm pathway information. Tagging SNPs for these genes were selected using data from the International HapMap Project (Release 21 with NCBI build 36; http://www.hapmap.org). SNPs were selected based on the following criteria: located either in the respective gene or no more than 10 kb upstream or downstream of the gene (to cover the regulatory regions); minor allele frequency (MAF) >5%, and not already represented by another tag SNP at a linkage disequilibrium (LD) of r2 > 0.80. For each candidate gene, all SNPs meeting selection criteria that were not in LD with another already chosen SNP (r2 ≤ 0.80) were also included, to ensure that candidate genes were adequately covered. Additionally, SNPs residing in coding regions (synonymous SNPs, nonsynonymous SNPs), regulatory regions (promoter, splicing site, 5-UTR, and 3-UTR), and noncoding regions were included. In addition, SNPs previously reported to be associated with smoking phenotypes (Bierut et al.) were also included in the analyses. Table S1 enumerates the name, base pair position, and chromosome associated with each of the 565 SNPs examined in this study that were retained after the quality control, and also includes results of the logistic regression analyses conducted on each SNP separately, including best-fitted genetic model and parameter estimate for each SNP.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>DNA samples from a total of 1274 participants were sent for genotyping. Genotyping of the candidate SNPs was performed using an Illumina GoldenGate assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Ninety-three percent of the SNPs analyzed had Illumina SNP scores of >0.6. Genotyping of DNA samples (250 ng) was conducted following Illumina's standard 3-day protocol. The BeadArray reader (Illumina, Inc.) was used to autocall data from the SNP array. Cluster definitions for each SNP were determined using Illumina BeadStudio Genotyping Module (v. 2.3.41). SNP genotype assignments (calls) were made when a genotype yielded a quality value (Gencall score) of 95% or higher. Among the markers included in this study, only 1.5% had a Gencall score less than 95% (10 of 672). Seventy blind duplicate pairs were included, and the overall concordance of SNP genotype calls was greater than 99%.<SEP>Statistical analyses<SEP>Univariable linear regression models were used to examine associations between social disinhibition score and all demographic and psychosocial covariates (age, gender, parental education, level of acculturation, TAS score, and DAS score). An overall multivariable model was then developed using these same demographic and psychosocial risk factors. In these regression analyses, gender and parental education were modeled as categorical variables, whereas age, acculturation, TAS scores, and DAS scores were all modeled as continuous covariates. However, in our descriptive data summary table, we also showed acculturation, TAS score, and DAS score results as categorical data (based on median splits) in addition to giving continuous data estimates such as mean, standard deviation, and range, in an effort to further describe results for these variables.<SEP>For each candidate SNP, allelic data were recoded into three potential genetic models: an additive, a dominant, and a recessive model. Three separate linear regression analyses were then conducted for each candidate SNP (one for each genetic model), controlling for age and gender.<SEP>Because we performed three regression analyses for hundreds of candidate SNPs, we used the Bayesian False Discovery Probability (BFDP) test to determine the chance of obtaining false-positive results due to the multiple comparisons (Wakefield). We calculated BFDP values for the ten most statistically significant regression results for each risk model, using four levels of prior probability (0.01, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07), a prior odds ratio (OR) of 1.5, and setting our threshold of BFDP noteworthiness at the recommended value of 0.8 (Wakefield).<SEP>Principal components analysis was also conducted to test for possible underlying ethnic stratification, with the use of EIGENSTRAT software (Price et al.). We first applied principal components analysis to the genotype data to infer continuous axes of genetic variation (eigenvectors). We then used the top axes of variation as covariates in a multiple regression analysis (described below).<SEP>The best-fitting genetic model (i.e., dominant, recessive, or additive) for each SNP with significant regression results as well as a BFDP value of <0.8 were examined simultaneously in a multiple linear regression model, which also included demographic and psychosocial risk factors and relevant principal component terms to adjust for underlying ethnic stratification. A final model of significant SNPs (adjusting for these other variables) was determined using a manual backwards elimination process (those SNPs with a P-value >0.05 in the multivariable model were removed).","Results<SEP>DNA from 1274 enrolled youth was available for analysis. Of the individuals genotyped, 1132 had social disinhibition data available. However, due to additional missing data for parental education (n = 65), linguistic acculturation (n = 2), and on one of the SNPs of interest (rs4938056; n = 2), the final sample size available for the multivariable analyses was 1064.<SEP>Demographic characteristics and psychosocial risk factors of study participants are shown in Table 1. The cohort was evenly split by gender, the mean age of participants was 14.4 years (SD = 1.03), and overall, the mean social disinhibition score was very close to the middle of the range of values (3.3; SD = 1.9). Males had a significantly higher mean social disinhibition score than females (F = 34.4, df = 1, P ≤ 0.001). Age was also significantly associated with mean social disinhibition score (F = 13.7, df = 5, P < 0.001); youth ≥14 years of age had higher mean scores than youth 12 or 13 years of age.<SEP>Youth with at least one parent who had completed high school or had attained additional education past high school reported higher mean social disinhibition scores compared with youth whose parents did not graduate high school (F = 5.2, df = 2, P = 0.006). The mean linguistic acculturation score for the cohort was 3.5 (SD = 0.9); participants with higher linguistic acculturation scores reported higher mean social disinhibition scores (F = 30.7, df = 2, P < 0.001) compared to their less acculturated counterparts. Participants' mean TAS and DAS scores were 6.9 (SD = 3.3) and 1.2 (SD = 1.6), respectively. Both scores were significantly and positively associated with mean social disinhibition score (P < 0.001 for both).<SEP>A total of 672 candidate SNPs were genotyped. Ten SNPs had a Gencall score of less than 95%, 78 additional SNPs failed the minor allele frequency test (MAF <0.05), and 19 SNPs failed the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test (P < 0.000001). A total of 565 SNPs were included in the analyses. There were 60 SNPs with P < 0.05 based on the best genetic model fit (additive, dominant, or recessive), adjusting for age and sex. After controlling for false discovery, we identified 11 SNPs with a statistically significant BFDP of <0.8 and a prior probability of 0.05.<SEP>For the principal components analysis, we used N = 1132 participants and 511 SNPs which were shown to be unassociated with the social disinhibition outcome in univariate analyses at a significance level of 0.05 based on the best genetic model fit (additive, dominant, or recessive model). We did not observe significant ethnic stratification in our data from the principal components analysis. Because only the top three eigenvalues (derived from the top three principal components) were significantly larger than the subsequent eigenvalues, we used these 3 largest principal components in our analyses (Tian et al.,; Nassir et al.,). We also considered controlling for the top 5 and top 10 largest principal components but found no significant difference in the association between SNPs and social disinhibition.<SEP>Six of the 11 SNPs were found to be significant at α = 0.05 level in the final multivariable model, which included demographic and psychosocial characteristics as well as the three largest principal components terms. Two of these SNPs are in the serotonin pathway (rs9534511 on HTR2A and rs4938056 on HTR3B), and one is in an intronic region of an opioid receptor gene (rs1998220 on OPRM1). One SNP (rs1003921) resides in an intronic region of KCNC1, one SNP (rs16116) is in an intergenic region downstream of NPY, and one SNP (rs16870286) is part of LINC00518, a miscellaneous RNA gene that codes for an uncharacterized protein. Information about these SNPs, including model used, multivariable P-value, and allelic frequency, is shown in Table 2.<SEP>Parameter estimates for the final multivariable model are shown in Table 3. Age, linguistic acculturation, TAS, and DAS were all significantly positively associated with increased risk of social disinhibition (P < 0.001). Each 1-year increase in age was estimated to increase social disinhibition score by 0.20 points (95% CI = 0.12–0.29), and each 1-point increase in a participant's overall linguistic acculturation score was expected to increase their social disinhibition score by 0.30 points (95% CI = 0.20–0.41). Similarly, each 1-unit increase in TAS or DAS score is expected to increase participants' social disinhibition score by 0.20 (95% CI = 0.17–0.23) and 0.45 points (95% CI = 0.40–0.51), respectively. Gender and parental education, however, were not significantly associated with social disinhibition score (P = 0.54 and P = 0.13, respectively).<SEP>Minor alleles for three of the SNPs were associated with increased risk of social disinhibition (rs1998220, rs9534511, and rs4938056), while the other three SNPs' minor alleles were associated with protective effects (rs16116, rs16870286, and rs1003921). For those SNPs that were positively associated with increased social disinhibition score, parameter estimates (the amount a minor allele was estimated to change social disinhibition score by) ranged from 0.19 (rs1998220; 95% CI = 0.06–0.32, P = 0.003) to 0.32 (rs9534511; 95% CI = 0.14–0.50, P < 0.001). Parameter estimates for SNPs that were negatively associated with increased social disinhibition score ranged from −0.29 (rs16116; 95% CI = −0.48 to −0.09, P = 0.004) to −0.64 (rs1003921; 95% CI = −1.13 to −0.15, P = 0.011).","Discussion<SEP>We identified six SNPs that were significantly associated with social disinhibition among Mexican-American youth. These included two SNPs in the serotonin pathway, one in an intronic region of an opioid receptor gene, one in an intronic region of a potassium channel gene, one in an intergenic region near the neuropeptide Y gene, and one in a gene that codes for an uncharacterized RNA protein.<SEP>The serotonin pathway plays a role in neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, and autism, and also plays a role in regulating social behavior (Oreland et al.; Kinast et al.). As Zuckerman observed, serotonin appears to act as a behavioral inhibitor. We observed two variants in the serotonin pathway (in HTR2A and HTR3B) that were significantly associated with an increased risk of social disinhibition; our findings appear consistent with current knowledge about the serotonin pathway. Wilkinson et al. also reported an association between a SNP near HTR2A (9567732) and cigarette experimentation among adolescents, as well as an association between another gene in the serotonin pathway (HTR1B) and cigarette experimentation. Since cigarette experimentation is associated with increased social disinhibition, our study results are also consistent with these findings.<SEP>The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu-opioid receptor, which has been associated with drug addiction, including nicotine dependence (Zhang et al.). The OPRM1 SNP that was significantly associated with an increased risk of social disinhibition in our study (rs1998220) was part of a 3-SNP haplotype found in a previous study to be associated with increased feelings of energy, euphoria, and stimulation, and was also independently associated with amphetamine response (Dlugos et al.). We previously reported that another SNP (rs9567732) on OPRM1 was associated with adolescent cigarette experimentation among committed never smokers (Wilkinson et al.); the SNP identified in this study (rs1998220) is not in LD with rs9567732. These findings are consistent with our results, because drug dependence and cigarette experimentation are associated with social disinhibition (McGue et al.; Wilkinson et al.), as is increased sensitivity to sensations of energy and euphoria (Stoops et al.).<SEP>KCNC1 is a gene that codes for a potassium voltage-gated channel protein. More specifically, this gene encodes a membrane protein which mediates potassium-ion permeability of membranes. This channel is often expressed in neurons, and it enables them to repetitively fire at a high frequency (Rudy and McBain; Pedroarena). In mouse models, mice that lacked two potassium voltage-gated channels (Kv3.1 encoded by KCNC1 as well as Kv3.3) exhibited tremor, ataxia, and alcohol hypersensitivity (McMahon et al.; Joho and Hurlock), as well as altered circadian rhythms (Kudo et al.).<SEP>NPY encodes neuropeptide Y, which is commonly expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. NPY expression helps to inhibit anxiety, and genetic variations in the expression of NPY modulate emotion and stress response (Zhou et al.; Benarroch). A study by Zhou et al. found that several rare 7-SNP haplotypes were associated with higher expression of NPY and thus with lower trait anxiety. Similarly, we observed that the minor allele of rs16116, downstream of NPY, had a protective effect upon social disinhibition score (was associated with decreased social disinhibition). NPY is also associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder (Coccaro et al.). A genetic variant in NPY (SNP rs16147) has also been associated with an increased risk of smoking tobacco (Mutschler et al.); however, this SNP is not in LD with rs16116.<SEP>The LINC00518 gene on chromosome 6 codes for an uncharacterized RNA protein, and little is known about the function of this protein. However, chromosomal duplications and deletions in or near this gene seem to be linked to several behavioral disorders, such as ADHD, autism-spectrum disorders, and developmental delays (Lionel et al.; Celestino-Soper et al.). This gene is also very close (8126 base pairs away) to the TFAP2A gene (http://www.genecards.org), which encodes transcription factor AP-2 α. Transcription factor AP-2 helps to regulate neural development and neural gene expression (Oreland et al.).<SEP>All demographic and psychosocial risk factors analyzed in this study (age, gender, linguistic acculturation, parental education, and TAS and DAA scores) were significantly associated with social disinhibition score in univariable analyses (Table 1). However, in the multivariable model (Table 3), gender and parental education were no longer significantly associated with SD score, after adjusting for all other variables in the model. Steinberg et al. observed that among adolescents, sensation seeking increased between 10 and 15 years of age, and then either remained stable or decreased thereafter. Our social disinhibition univariable results showed a very similar pattern. In our univariable results, males tended to have higher social disinhibition scores than females. Other studies have also reported higher disinhibition as well as higher total sensation-seeking scores for males (Zuckerman et al.; Zuckerman; Roberti).<SEP>In this study, acculturation was significantly associated with social disinhibition, both in univariable and multivariable analyses (P < 0.001). Consistent with previous findings (Wilkinson et al.), youth with higher acculturation levels tended to have higher social disinhibition scores. Although in this study, we have focused on social disinhibition as being problematic, it is possible that in immigrants, this trait might also be adaptive. The desire to immigrate has been associated with increased sensation-seeking tendencies (Winchie and Carment); therefore, social disinhibition might be associated with characteristics such as increased venturesomeness, a greater likelihood of staying in school, or of being involved in the larger community. However, it is possible that this advantage is greater in parents (the immigrants themselves) than in offspring.<SEP>Parental education was significantly associated with social disinhibition in a univariable model (P = 0.006), but not in the final multivariable model (P = 0.125). Youth with higher parental education levels (high school or greater) tended to have higher social disinhibition scores than youth whose parents did not finish high school. Parental education was likely excluded from the final multivariable model because linguistic acculturation and parental education were weakly (r = 0.23) but significantly correlated (P < 0.001), and the univariable F statistic was lower for education than acculturation. Likewise, gender might also have been excluded from the multivariable model because it was significantly correlated with TAS score (r = −0.36, P < 0.001), and had a smaller univariable F score than did TAS score.<SEP>Sensation-seeking tendencies, similar to other behavioral traits such as depressive symptoms, anger traits, and sensitivity to stress (Mizuno et al.; Baud et al.; Shifman et al.; Guo and Tillman), vary by gender (Russo et al.; Wilkinson et al.). Because gender differences are seen across all aspects of sensation seeking, and because social disinhibition score differed significantly by gender in our univariable analysis (Table 1), we completed an exploratory stratified analysis by gender. One SNP demonstrated a significant SNP by gender interaction (rs16870286 on LINC00518; Wald χ2(1 df) = 4.26; P = 0.039). Among the remaining SNPs, while different SNPs were significantly associated with social disinhibition for males than for females, this was likely due to reduced sample sizes when stratifying by gender, as the magnitude of the effect of the SNPs differed between males and females but the direction of each SNP's association was the same.<SEP>Strengths of this study included that the data used were from a population-based cohort, and had fairly equal numbers of boys and girls. Validated measures were used for linguistic acculturation and all three sensation-seeking subscale (social disinhibition, TAS, and DAS) scores. Psychosocial and demographic data were obtained from the participants directly, instead of collecting these data from a parent or guardian proxy. The use of personal digital assistants to collect participant information also ensured a high level of participant privacy as well as valid and high-quality data. Finally, this study focused on an understudied population—that of low-income Mexican-American youth.<SEP>The primary limitation of this study is the lack of a replication sample with which to validate our findings; therefore, our study results should only be viewed as preliminary. However, the absence of an independent replication sample is fairly typical in studies of minority populations. Second, all participants in this study were Mexican-origin youth, and thus, results might not generalize to youth of other races, ethnicities, or countries of origin. Social disinhibition data, as well as other psychosocial data, were self-reported, and might have been subject to recall bias. Although we tried to include all known candidate genes for sensation-seeking tendencies and cigarette smoking behaviors in our analysis, our list was not exhaustive. For example, SNPs on the CTNNA2 gene, which has been associated with excitement seeking in GWAS and a meta-analysis (Terracciano et al.), were not included in this study. Potential candidate SNPs reported by McGue et al. in a recent GWAS of behavioral disinhibition were also not included. Similarly, other candidate genes may not have been included in this analysis either because they were missed or have been recently identified. Finally, this was a cross-sectional study, and we cannot determine causality. This also means that significant SNPs (or the genes that they are associated with) in the model might not be functionally significant.<SEP>In conclusion, this study presents six SNPs that were significantly associated with social disinhibition in Mexican-American youth. These results add to our knowledge of genetic risk factors for social disinhibition, an aspect of sensation seeking that has been strongly associated with cigarette and alcohol experimentation among adolescents. Additional research is needed to verify whether these SNPs are associated with social disinhibition among youth of different ethnicities and nationalities, and to elucidate whether/how these SNPs functionally contribute to social disinhibition and associated behaviors.",31095,['EATBTS']
18606956,"There is growing recognition that cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) plays a major role in alcohol and other drug addictions. Much of this work has focused on the interaction between the cannabinoid system and neuronal substrates that underlie drug-seeking behavior (Kalivas and Volkow provide a review of the neurobiologic mechanisms). The CB1 receptor is the most prevalent G protein–coupled receptor in the brain, and the CB1 receptor is densely localized to the same structures that underlie drug-seeking behavior (eg, the ventral tegmental area [VTA], nucleus accumbens [NAcc], prefrontal cortex [PFC], basolateral amygdala, and hippocampus). On a mechanistic level, the cannabinoid system regulates the release of dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate. The CB1 receptors located on GABA interneurons suppress GABA release, which disinhibits dopaminergic projections to the accumbens and increases dopaminergic activation (Maldonado et al and De Vries and Schoffelmeer provide reviews). The CB1 receptors also regulate glutamatergic projections from the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus by inhibiting the release ofGABA and GABAergic projections from the accumbens to the VTA, indirectly activating the VTA.<SEP>With respect to alcohol, the CB1 receptor mediates the effects of alcohol on the neuronal circuitry that underlies reward and the attribution of incentive salience. Recent studies have demonstrated that CB1 antagonists (eg, rimonabant) block the ability of alcohol to initiate the release of dopamine in the accumbens, decrease alcohol intake in alcohol- preferring and normal rats, and prevent the ability of cues associated with alcohol and other drugs to reinstate consumption. In addition, CB1 agonists increase alcohol intake in rats. Moreover, CB1 knockout mice consume less alcohol, show deficits in cue-initiated reinstatement and place preference, and do not demonstrate alcohol withdrawal symptoms or alcohol-induced increases in dopamine release in the accumbens. Furthermore, alcohol-preferring animals have greater levels of CB1 messenger RNA in the structures that underlie drug-seeking behavior. Thus, the evidence is clear about the importance of the CB1 receptor and the gene that codes for this receptor (CNR1 [OMIM 114610]).<SEP>Despite findings from the animal literature, similar studies in the human literature are almost nonexistent. Although a CB1 antagonist has been tested with nicotine dependence, to our knowledge, there have been no published trials with alcohol dependence. Regarding the gene that codes for the CB1 receptor, several studies found an association between CNR1 genetic variants and alcohol dependence, and 2 others did not. Contradictory results are not surprising given the many variables that affect the development of alcohol dependence, the potential error in the assignment of the diagnosis, and the dichotomous nature of a variable that reflects a spectrum disorder. Thus, the use of alcohol dependence as the sole phenotypic end point is a limitation. One of these studies noted that several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with messenger RNA changes, and these same SNPs also overlap with SNPs associated with a reward-related neuroimaging phenotype.<SEP>The present investigation encompassed multiple approaches, including receptor binding in postmortem brain tissue, functional magnetic resonance imaging, human laboratory models, and analyses of treatment outcome data. Specifically, this investigation was designed to test the effect of a specific CNR1 SNP (rs2023239) associated with substance dependence and CNR1 messenger RNA changes and linked to loci associated with a neuroimaging phenotype. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) rs2023239 may be associated with differential CB1 binding in the PFC based on previous evidence suggesting a link with messenger RNA levels; (2) rs2023239 may be associated with differences in brain activation during the presentation of alcohol cues using a neuroimaging paradigm and may be associated with the rewarding effects of alcohol based on previous evidence suggesting an association with neuroimaging phenotypes and the extensive literature on the importance of the CB1 receptor in alcohol reward; and (3) rs2023239 may be associated with the effects of a medication on the incentive salience of alcohol and drinking behavior in a treatment outcome trial based on the notion that the medication is effective because it dampens mesocorticolimbic activity.","METHODS<SEP>Each of the multiple approaches used in this investigation is described in the following subsections. All the studies were approved by the University of Colorado human research committee.<SEP>CB1 BINDING ASSAY IN HUMAN POSTMORTEM BRAIN TISSUE<SEP>From 25 to 50 mg of recently collected postmortem tissue (from Brodmann areas 9 and 10) from 20 individuals (10 male white alcoholics and 10 matched controls) was received on dry ice from the Australian Brain Donor Program New South Wales Tissue Resource Centre, University of Sydney, and was immediately stored in a −70°C freezer.<SEP>To prepare crude particulate fractions, samples were thawed, suspended in 0.1X buffer (buffer consists of NAcc, 140mM; potassium chloride, 1.5mM; calcium chloride, 2.0mM; magnesium sulfate, 1.0mM; and N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N′-[2-ethanesulfonic acid], 25mM; pH, 7.5), homogenized using a motor-driven pestle, and centrifuged at 15 000g for 20 minutes. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in fresh 0.1X buffer and again centrifuged. The resuspension/ centrifugation cycle was repeated 3 times. After the fourth centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, fresh hypotonic buffer was added, and the samples were stored frozen as pellets until assay for tritium-labeled CP55,940 binding.<SEP>Tritium-labeled CP55,940 binding was measured as described previously using a 96-well cell harvester (Inotech Biosystems, Rockville, Maryland) with the following modifications. The total volume of the binding reactions was 210 µL. Immediately before filtration, volumes were increased to 1 mL with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and filtration was performed using 0.1% bovine serum albumin as wash solution. The tritium-labeled CP55,940 concentration was 1.2nM, and nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of CP55,940, 10µM. Samples were counted using a liquid scintillation counter (MicroBeta TriLux; Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, Massachusetts) after the addition of scintillant. Binding levels were determined using the method of Lowry et al.<SEP>GENOMIC DNA EXTRACTION AND SNP GENOTYPING<SEP>Genomic DNA was collected from buccal cells (cheek swabs) following published procedures. For the brain samples, genomic DNA was extracted from 5 to 10 mg of the PFC using a commercially available product (DNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, California) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The purity and quantity of DNA were determined by means of spectrophotometric analysis and then adjusted to a concentration of 20 ng/µL. The SNP rs2023239 was assayed using a premade TaqMan genotyping assay (hcv11600616; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). The SNP assays were performed using a reaction volume of 15 µL, which consisted of 7.5 µL of TaqMan 2X universal master mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.38 µL of 20X TaqMan predesigned SNP genotyping assay, 6.14 µL of nuclease-free water, and 1 µL of genomic DNA. After polymerase chain reaction amplification per the manufacturer’s recommendations, SNP genotypes were determined by allelic discrimination using a sequence detector instrument (ABI-7500; Applied Biosystems). At least 10% of the samples were repeated, and no error was detected when comparing those samples with the previous samples.<SEP>NEUROIMAGING ANALYSES<SEP>Blood oxygenation level–dependent functional magnetic resonance images were collected for 34 individuals during exposure to alcohol cues. For inclusion, individuals had to report drinking twice per week and at least 5 drinks per occasion (4 drinks for women). Participants also completed alcohol use disorder and craving measures (the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT] and the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire [AUQ]).<SEP>Details on the procedure are presented elsewhere. Participants were presented with 2 echoplanar imaging (EPI) runs consisting of subject-relevant alcohol vs control taste cues (litchi juice). Each EPI consisted of 12 pseudorandom trials of the alcohol and control taste cues. A single trial was composed of a continuous 24-second taste delivery period (total liquid delivered, 1 mL) accompanied by visual instructions. This was followed by a 16-second washout wherein the word rest was visually presented.<SEP>Blood oxygenation level–dependent images were collected using a 3-T scanner (Signa; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) using a gradient-echo, echoplanar sequence (repetition time, 2000 milliseconds; echo time, 30 milliseconds; flip angle, 90°; field of view, 24 cm; matrix size, 64 × 64; slice thickness, 5 mm; and number of slices, 29). For 2-stage registration of the EPIs, a high-resolution, T1-weighted, 3-dimensional magnetic resonance image (40 axial slices of part of the head; matrix, 512 × 512) acquired using the same slice angles, thickness, and gap as the EPIs and a high-resolution structural image using the inversion-recovery, spoiled, gradient-echo recalled sequence (inversion time, 500 milliseconds; flip angle, 7°; slice thickness, 1.5 mm; matrix, 256 × 256; field of view, 200 × 200 mm; bandwidth, 15.6 kHz; and number of slices, 124) were collected close to EPI acquisition. The tastes were delivered via fluorocarbon resin tubing using a computer-controlled pump system (Custom Infinity Controller; J-Kem Scientific, St Louis, Missouri) that was synchronized with visual instructions programmed in E-Prime and presented using a goggle system.<SEP>Imaging data analyses were conducted through FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) version 5.43, part of FSL (FMRIB Software Library). Standard preprocessing was applied, including nonbrain removal using the Brain Extraction Tool method, spatial smoothing using a gaussian kernel of full width at half maximum of 8-mm, mean-based intensity normalization of all volumes by the same factor and high-pass temporal filtering (σ = 50.0 seconds). Time series statistical analysis was performed using FMRIB’s Improved Linear Model with local autocorrelation correction. Regressors were created by convolving the stimulus timing files with a double γ-variate hemodynamic response function. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to estimate the hemodynamic parameters for different explanatory variables (ie, alcohol taste period, control taste period, and baseline period), and a corresponding t statistic indicated the significance of the activation of the stimulus. The primary contrast was the alcohol vs control taste period. For comparisons between genotype groups, these contrast maps were then registered to a high-resolution image using FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool. A priori region-of-interest anatomical masks were created using previously described methods for the NAcc/ventral striatum, the VTA, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC). Group-level analysis was performed using FLAME (FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) stage 1 only (ie, without the final Markov Chain Monte Carlo–based stage). Z (gaussianized T/F) statistical images were thresholded using gaussian random field theory–based maximum height thresholding with a significance of P = .05.<SEP>To determine the relationship between brain activation in response to cues and subjective craving, Pearson product moment correlations were performed between region-of-interest (NAcc, VTA, left and right OFC, or VMPFC) peak percentage signal change values and AUDIT and AUQ scores. For these analyses, more restricted region-of-interest masks for the smaller regions, such as the NAcc (x, 8 to 16; y, 14 to 6; z, −4 to −12) and the VTA (x, −8 to −4; y, −10 to −18; z, −8 to −16), were used for better localization. Group differences were investigated by converting the correlation coefficients to z scores and dividing the difference by the standard error. Larger masks were used in the main analyses to avoid missing significant findings. The regions of interest for the correlation analysis were restricted to a smaller size to focus the correlations on the peak activity in the theoretically meaningful voxels.<SEP>SHORT-TERM RESPONSES TO ALCOHOL<SEP>Study 1<SEP>Volunteers (n = 74) provided informed consent before participating. Participants were compensated $100 for study completion. Moderate to heavy drinkers aged 18 to 25 years were recruited from the Denver or Boulder, Colorado, metropolitan area.<SEP>Participants were scheduled for 2 sessions, 1 week apart. Consistent with previous studies, participants consumed 3 standard drinks with equivalent alcohol content during 1 session and 3 placebo drinks in the other session, for which the order was randomized. Laboratory sessions were scheduled between noon and 6 PM. After each drink, participants completed measures of reward and positive affect. During the baseline session, participants completed a battery of self-report tobacco use assessments. A demographic questionnaire collected information on age, sex, marital status, socioeconomic status, occupation, annual income, educational level, and race. An alcohol history questionnaire collected information on frequency and quantity of alcohol use. At the beginning of the following (experimental) session, participants underwent breathalyzer testing to ensure that they had not been drinking before the session. The rewarding effects of alcohol were measured using the Alcohol Rating Scale, which included the following items: How satisfying was the drink? How enjoyable was the drink? How much did you like the drink? The elation scale from the Profile of Mood States was used to measure positive affect. Analyses involved a 2 (genotype: TT vs CT) × 3 (drink: 1 vs 2 vs 3) analysis of variance (ANOVA). The difference scores (alcohol session minus placebo session) for reward and positive affect were the dependent variables in the ANOVA.<SEP>Study 2<SEP>To provide further replication, data from a previously published study (n = 67) were reanalyzed with rs2023239. The methods differed considerably because the present study did not include a placebo alcohol condition and was designed to examine the effects of active and control medications on responses to alcohol. The dependent variables were subjective high and reward (as described previously).<SEP>TREATMENT STUDY<SEP>To examine the treatment implications of rs2023239, we reanalyzed data from a previous clinical trial (N = 69) that involved a medication that targets the mesocorticolimbic neurocircuitry. The methods of this study are described briefly; they are described in detail elsewhere.<SEP>Participants were selected based on DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence and the consumption of 14 drinks (women) or 21 drinks (men) on average per week for 4 consecutive weeks. Participants had to be within 21 days of their last drink to be included. Patients were excluded if they met the criteria for specific psychiatric diagnoses (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, bulimia, or anorexia nervosa), reported a psychological disorder requiring pharmacotherapy, endorsed current use of illicit drugs other than marijuana, or tested positive for illicit drugs other than marijuana.<SEP>The analyses included 69 participants randomized to a 12- week trial of olanzapine (5 mg) or placebo. Participants completed baseline measures of demographics, personality, alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and motivation for change. At 2 weeks, these participants completed a cue reactivity assessment that involved comparing reactivity between controls (eg, a nonalcoholic beverage such as Gatorade) and alcohol-related cues (eg, the preferred alcoholic beverage). During the control cue exposure, participants were asked to lift and sniff Gatorade without tasting it for 3 minutes. Participants completed measures of mood and craving before and after exposure. After a 5-minute relaxation period, participants repeated the cue exposure with their preferred alcoholic beverage and completed the same craving and mood measures. All the participants received 2 sessions of a brief, psychosocial intervention. These sessions occurred at the end of the baseline and cue reactivity sessions.<SEP>With respect to cue reactivity, the AUQ was used to measure craving during the cue reactivity assessment. The AUQ consists of 8 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale anchored by “strongly disagree” and “strongly agree.” The AUQ has demonstrated high reliability in assessing urge to drink.<SEP>Consistent with previous studies, the primary outcomes were drinks per drinking day measured at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks using a timeline follow-back procedure. Of the 69 participants, 46 had the TT genotype, 22 had the CT genotype, and 1 had the CC genotype. For the analyses, the individual with the CC genotype was included in the CT group. The baseline data suggested that the groups did not differ on sex, ethnicity, or tobacco use.","RESULTS<SEP>Figure 1 depicts the regulatory and coding regions of CNR1 based on the study by Zhang et al and the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Analyses were focused on rs2023239 found in the region upstream of exon 3, which has been described as an alternative promoter. Each approach described in the “Methods” section has a corresponding result subsection.<SEP>CB1 BINDING LEVELS IN POSTMORTEM PFC<SEP>To test the association between rs2023239 and CB1 receptor levels, CB1 binding was quantified in postmortem human PFC and the relationship between rs2023239 and CB1 binding was assessed. Ten samples were genotyped as TT and 10 as CT. The ANOVA revealed that individuals with the CT genotype for rs2023239 demonstrated significantly greater CB1 binding in Brodmann areas 9 and 10 compared with individuals with the TT genotype (F1,16 = 9.62, P < .01) (Figure 2).<SEP>CUE-ELICITED CRAVING AND BRAIN ACTIVATION<SEP>Because CNR1 receptors modulate the mesocorticolimbic neurocircuitry that underlies drug-seeking behavior in animals, it was expected that the genetic variation that alters CB1 receptor levels would also be associated with the differential activation of these structures during exposure to alcohol cues. To explore the functional significance of rs2023239, data from a recent neuroimaging study were reanalyzed. Participants were 34 heavy drinkers who were right-handed and had no history of psychiatric or neurologic disorders. Two participants had the CC genotype and 8 had the CT genotype. Individuals with at least 1 copy of C (n=10; mean [SD] age, 21.5 [0.71] years; 7 men; all white participants) were age matched with 24 participants who had the TT genotype (mean [SD] age, 22.5 [1.59] years; 17 men; 21 white, 1 Asian, and 2 Latin American participants).<SEP>The CT group demonstrated greater activation when alcohol was contrasted with inactive (ie, rest) and active (ie, litchi juice) appetitive controls in the NAcc, VMPFC, VTA, and OFC compared with the TT group (P < .05) (Figure 3). Pearson product moment correlations between peak activity in these regions and subjective measures indicated several significant findings. In the CT group, the alcohol use disorder score, measured using the AUDIT, was significantly correlated with activation of the NAcc (r = 0.83, P = .003) and the VMPFC (r = 0.68, P = .03) using the alcohol vs active control contrast. In addition, the urge to consume alcohol in the CT group, as measured using the total AUQ score, was also significantly correlated with the VMPFC (r = 0.67, P = .03), the left OFC (r = 0.80, P = .005), and the right OFC (r = 0.62, P = .06). The only correlations that were significant in the TT group were the correlations between the left and right OFC and the AUDIT score (r = 0.42, P < .05 and r = 0.51, P = .01) (Table).<SEP>SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON SUBJECTIVE REWARD<SEP>A human laboratory study was conducted to determine whether rs2023239 was associated with the rewarding effects of alcohol. Fifty-six individuals had the TT genotype, 15 had the CT genotype, and 3 had the CC genotype for rs2023239. The individuals with the CC and CT genotypes were combined into 1 group to facilitate analyses. The first set of analyses tested for differences between the TT and CT groups on demographics and alcohol/ other drug use variables. There were no differences in self-reported ancestry. There was 1 individual with African American ancestry in the TT group; the CT group included 1 Latin American, 1 Asian, and 1 African American individual. Of the TT group, 50% smoked tobacco, and of the CT group, 54% smoked tobacco. There were no significant differences (P > .05) between the TT and CT groups in mean (SD) age (21.6 [3] years vs 22.4 [3] years), sex (66% vs 79% male), or mean (SD) past-month quantity of alcohol use measured using a 30-day timeline follow-back method (72 [50] vs 72 [41] standard drinks). Mean breath alcohol levels after each of the 3 drinks were 0.018%, 0.038%, and 0.055% and did not differ by genotype. To ensure that population stratification was not a confounding factor, analyses were repeated with only the white individuals. No differences emerged.<SEP>The primary analyses focused on the reward and positive affect scales of the Profile of Mood States. The analyses involved a 2 (genotype: TT vs CT or CC) × 3 (drink: 1 vs 2 vs 3) repeated-measures ANOVA. The dependent variable was the difference between the alcohol and placebo beverage scores for each drink. Analyses revealed a significant main effect for genotype (F1,69 = 4.27, P <.05) such that individuals with the CT genotype reported significantly greater reward and positive affect after drinking (F1,69 = 6.27, P < .05) (Figure 4A and B).<SEP>To determine whether these results could be replicated with an earlier study, data from a previously published study were reanalyzed. This previous study allowed us to examine the interaction between a medication that targets the dopamine system (olanzapine) and rs2023239. The analyses involved a 2 (medication: olanzapine vs cyproheptadine hydrochloride) × 2 (genotype: TT vs CT and CC) × 3 (drink: 1 vs 2 vs 3) repeated-measures ANOVA. The analyses revealed a genotype × drink interaction (F2,112 = 5.19, P = .01) such that individuals with the CT genotype reported greater reward from the alcoholic beverages. There were no significant genotype × medication interactions on this measure (P > .05). In lieu of positive affect, we examined self-reported high. The analyses revealed a significant medication × genotype × drink interaction on self-reported high (F2,112 = 3.39, P < .05). Individuals with the CT (or CC) genotype (n = 9) who received the active control medication (cyproheptadine) reported the greatest high after the third drink (Figure 4C). There were no significant differences between individuals with the CT genotype and those with the TT genotype for the olanzapine condition (Figure 4D).<SEP>CUE-ELICITED CRAVING AND TREATMENT OUTCOME<SEP>Given the suggestion that there might be an interaction between CNR1 variation and olanzapine on the rewarding effects of alcohol, we reanalyzed data from a recent clinical trial of olanzapine. This study examined the effects of olanzapine (5 mg) on cue-elicited craving and drinks per drinking day during a 12-week trial in a sample of treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals. In the reanalysis, rs2023239 was included as a moderator. There were 23 individuals in the CT group and 46 individuals in the TT group. The analyses revealed a significant medication × genotype × cue interaction on craving (F1,65 = 5.29, P < .05) such that individuals with the CT genotype reported greater cue-elicited craving when treated with placebo vs olanzapine (Figure 5A and B). Individuals with the CT genotype reported greater drinks per drinking day compared with individuals with the TT genotype when treated with placebo vs olanzapine (F1,65 = 3.94, P = .05) (Figure 5C and D).","COMMENT<SEP>Frequently, studies of a genetic association lack mechanistic, translational data that link genetic variation with downstream changes in biological and behavioral phenotypes and the course of a disorder or treatment response. The present investigation was designed to translate the effects of variation in the CNR1 gene across different levels of phenotypes, from changes in receptor binding to neuronal activation after an alcohol cue challenge, to the subjective effects of alcohol consumption, and, ultimately, to treatment outcome differences. Based on previous studies suggesting that rs2023239 was the locus with the strongest association with substance abuse and in the region associated with differential brain activation to rewarding stimuli, this variation was advanced for more in-depth analysis. Analyses at the molecular level using human postmortem tissue suggest that the SNP was associated with greater CB1 receptors in critical prefrontal structures and, hence, might alter the response of the mesocorticolimbic circuitry that underlies drug-seeking behavior.<SEP>From the animal literature, it was clear that a variation in the CNR1 gene associated with increased levels of CB1 receptors in the PFC might alter the acquisition or expression of incentive salience for alcohol. To test this functional hypothesis, a neuroimaging paradigm examined the activation of mesocorticolimbic structures during exposure to the taste of an alcoholic beverage. The findings suggest that the C allele of rs2023239 is associated with greater activation of the NAcc, OFC, VTA, and VMPFC during exposure to alcohol vs either rest or control (ie, juice) cues. Not only do individuals with the CT genotype demonstrate greater activation in these key structures, but this activation (ie, the alcohol vs control contrast) is also strongly associated with alcohol use disorder and craving measures in individuals with the CT genotype. The findings from the neuroimaging study suggest that rs2023239 may be associated with changes in the mesocorticolimbic neurocircuitry, which, in turn, may mediate a change in the incentive salience of alcohol and the risk of an alcohol use disorder.<SEP>At the behavioral and clinical levels, data were analyzed from a new study and a previously published study of moderate to heavy non–treatment-seeking drinkers. In both studies, individuals with the CT genotype reported greater reward than those with the TT genotype when consuming alcohol. Specifically, individuals with the CT genotype seem to enjoy drinking alcohol more than those with the TT genotype. In addition, consistent with the neuroimaging results, there was a significant interaction with a medication that targets mesocorticolimbic neurocircuitry. These findings are also consistent with the animal studies that manipulated CB1 function and found that the CB1 receptor forms a critical link between alcohol and dopamine release in mesocorticolimbic structures. Thus, it seems that the CB1 receptor and the polymorphisms that alter the regulation of this receptor may affect the effects of alcohol on the mesocorticolimbic structures that underlie drugseeking behavior. The implication is that incentive salience may increase more rapidly with repeated exposure to alcohol in individuals with the CT genotype such that those with high levels of exposure might be expected to demonstrate greater levels of cue-elicited craving and might benefit from medications that target this neuronal circuitry.<SEP>In fact, this hypothesis was tested using data from a recent clinical trial. Individuals with the CT genotype demonstrated greater cue-elicited craving when treated with placebo but not when treated with a medication designed to dampen the mesocorticolimbic reactivity to cues. During a 12-week trial, alcohol-dependent individuals with the CT genotype demonstrated significant reductions in drinking during treatment with the active medication compared with placebo treatment. Conversely, individuals with the TT genotype responded equally well to the combination of placebo and psychosocial treatment vs active medication and psychosocial treatment. These findings are similar to those with the DRD4 variable number of tandem repeats reported by Hutchison and colleagues. Notably, χ2 tests indicated that these 2 loci were not linked in this sample.<SEP>Several limitations should be acknowledged. The sample size for the postmortem analyses is relatively small. Detecting the functional effects of genetic variation in postmortem tissue would benefit greatly from larger sample sizes. Because the results were consistent across the different studies in this article, we have confidence in these findings, although a larger sample size would be useful for providing a definitive test of the association between rs2023239 and CB1 receptor levels. Larger sample sizes in the context of the neuroimaging, behavioral, and clinical studies would also be helpful for testing the additive effects of genetic markers (eg, the DRD4 variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism and the μ-opioid receptor gene [OPRM1] A/G SNP) that have also been linked to these phenotypes. Another commonly cited limitation is population stratification. Although it is always possible that the results may be confounded by population stratification or other third variables, it is highly unlikely in the present study because the participants in each of the data sets were predominantly white (approximately 95%) and the findings were consistent across multiple studies and levels of analysis. We did not use genomic controls because the cost of assaying hundreds of extra markers was high, the benefits of using genomic controls in a sample that is 95% white were uncertain, and a reasonable alternative was available (ie, using self-reported ancestry as a covariate). Finally, future studies may benefit from testing additional loci in CNR1. A recent study used a haplotype approach to identify 2 SNPs that are associated with alcohol and drug dependence, 1 of which is linkage disequilibrium with rs2023239.<SEP>Overall, these findings suggest that individuals with the CT genotype may carry a genetic vulnerability that affects CB1 receptor levels in the mesocorticolimbic structures that underlie the rewarding effects of alcohol and the attribution of incentive salience to alcohol cues. The neuroimaging data, specifically the correlations between blood oxygenation level–dependent activation and alcohol use problems, suggest that the increased reactivity of these structures in response to alcohol cues may play an important role in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence for these individuals. For individuals without a genetic load for increased reactivity to cues, other factors may be more influential in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence. Likewise, the treatment study is consistent with the notion that individuals with this genetic risk may benefit most from a treatment that targets mesocorticolimbic reactivity, whereas individuals without this genetic risk may benefit minimally from this type of treatment.<SEP>This last point illustrates the promise of a translational approach. Although the etiologic end point may be the same (eg, alcohol dependence), the pathogenesis may differ from one individual to another. Ultimately, there may be several different trajectories that lead to alcohol dependence, guided by differences in the underlying neurobiologic mechanisms. These differences provide important clues regarding the most effective approach to treatment. Although traditional association studies are valuable, translational approaches facilitate the discovery of the neurobiologic mechanisms that mediate the effect of genetic variation on the development of a disorder and the development of more effective treatment approaches. With translational data, it is possible to advance a conceptualization of how genetic variation may affect the neurobiologic mechanisms of alcohol dependence.",32362,['EATBTS']
26337181,,,"Findings<SEP>Exogenous lipid metabolism involves packaging of dietary fat into chylomicrons in the small intestine, which are later transported to the bloodstream. The initial step of endogenous lipid metabolism involves the hydrolysis of chylomicrons by lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 1,000,000 in the United States and higher in other world regions, like Quebec, Canada due to a founder effect. The clinical presentation can include moderate or severe hypertriglyceridemia in affected homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, while simple heterozygote carriers often have normal lipids. Clinical features include eruptive xanthomas, abdominal pain, hepato-splenomegaly, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, recurrent pancreatitis, or lipemia retinalis. Dietary fat restriction is the cornerstone of treatment, and gene therapy trials are ongoing.<SEP>Case report<SEP>We report the case of an 11-week-old male of Puerto Rican descent who presented to the emergency department with coffee-ground emesis, melena and a papular rash. He was born full term to healthy, nonconsanguineous parents with a birth weight of 8 lb 4 oz and was exclusively breast-fed. He had 4–5 episodes of coffee-ground emesis, one episode of melena and a papular rash (Fig. 1) that spread from his extremities to his trunk over the course of 3 weeks. CBC revealed a hematocrit of 17 % and his blood was grossly lipemic. A random lipid panel showed triglycerides (TG) of 43,980 mg/dl.<SEP>The physical exam was notable for a well-appearing infant with diffuse 2 mm yellow papules consistent with eruptive xanthomas and lipemia retinalis on fundoscopic exam. Fasting lipid profile revealed total cholesterol 768 mg/dl, TG 37,695 mg/dl, and HDL < 10 mg/dl. Breast-feeding was discontinued and he was placed on Enfaport Lipil, a formula with 84 % of fat content from medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and 16 % from long-chain fats. A repeat lipid profile one month after the formula change revealed dramatic improvement in TG (Table 1). Two months after treatment, xanthomas and lipemia retinalis resolved; weight gain and linear growth were normal. We hypothesized that this child had an autosomal recessive mutation in the LPL gene.<SEP>Methods<SEP>Ethics, consent and permission:Approval was obtained from the Western University Ethics Review Board protocol 07920E and informed consent was obtained from both parents. The parents gave their consent to publish this case.<SEP>Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, QIAGEN Inc, Mississauga, ON, Canada). PCR amplifications were performed using primers covering the coding regions and ~100 bp of intron-exon boundaries of the LPL gene as described previously. Bi-directional Sanger sequencing was performed using established conditions on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). DNA sequences were analyzed using SeqScape v2.6 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).<SEP>Results and discussion<SEP>We found that the proband was a compound heterozygote for one novel and one reported mutation within exon 5 of the LPL gene (Fig. 2). The first mutation p.G215E was a heterozygous transition c.644G → A, resulting in a substitution of glycine to glutamic acid at amino acid 215 (identical to residue 188 in the mature protein). This mutation has been previously reported to cause LPL deficiency. The second, novel mutation p.Q240H was a heterozygous transversion c.721G → T, causing an amino acid substitution of glutamine to histidine at residue 240 (identical to residue 213 in the mature protein). In silico software programs PolyPhen2 and SIFT both predicted that this mutation was probably damaging. Both parents' DNA samples were sequenced: the LPL p.Q240H mutation was found in the father and the p.G215E mutation was found in the mother.<SEP>LPL plays a role in multiple stages of lipid metabolism, including hydrolysis of chylomicrons. LPL is primarily synthesized by myocytes and adipocytes and recent studies have identified glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) as the molecule responsible for transporting LPL to the capillary lumen. LPL deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by decreased LPL activity due to mutations in the LPL gene. The LPL gene is located on chromosome 8p21.3 and contains 10 exons, spanning ~ 30 kb and encodes a mature protein of 448 amino acids. Most mutations are found in exons 4, 5 and 6 and although missense mutations are more common, nonsense, frameshift, insertion, deletion and duplication mutations have also been described. The mutation in this patient expands the spectrum of known pathogenic LPL mutations to more than 150. It also occurs in a region of the protein that has to date been relatively bereft of reported mutations. The involvement of amino acid residue 240 also highlights the functional importance of the local domain in lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.<SEP>To date, genotype-phenotype correlations have not been identified. Patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygotes can present with marked hypertriglyceridemia. Heterozygote patients can have normal or mildly elevated TG levels. Both parents of our patient are heterozygous carriers of LPL gene mutations and had normal lipids.<SEP>The clinical manifestations of LPL deficiency are heterogeneous. Eruptive xanthomas appear mostly on shoulders, buttocks and extensor surfaces of the limbs when the TG levels exceed 2000 mg/dl. Lipemia retinalis involving the peripheral vessels can be seen with TG levels over 2,500 mg/dl and as the levels increase, the damage extends to the posterior pole. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal hemorrhage have been attributed to hyperviscosity secondary to elevated TG. Pancreatitis is common in these patients and risk increases with TG levels over 1,000 mg/dl. Therefore, the goal of therapy is to decrease TG levels < 1,000 mg/dl.<SEP>Dietary restriction remains the cornerstone of treatment and fat supplements using MCT are useful since they are absorbed directly into the portal vein. Long-term data on patients with LPL deficiency are limited but show normal linear growth and puberty despite dietary fat restriction. Even with recurrent pancreatitis, this population does not demonstrate a high mortality rate. Satisfactory TG levels can be difficult to achieve with diet restriction alone. Drug therapy using gemfibrozil, omega-3 fatty acids and orlistat may decrease TG levels when combined with a fat-restricted diet however, the use of these drugs is controversial. Therapy involving intramuscular introduction of a gain-of-function variant of the LPL gene is approved in Europe, although is costly and has only a transient effect. A promising treatment approach currently under investigation is orally-administered diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) inhibitors targeting DGAT1, which mediates triglyceride synthesis during dietary fat absorption.<SEP>Our patient is a compound heterozygote who has a novel p.Q240H mutation in exon 5 of the LPL gene causing severe hypertriglyceridemia. Although his TG levels are much improved with MCT-based formula, the challenge will be maintaining those levels with dietary fat restriction as table foods are introduced and he grows through childhood.<SEP>Competing interests<SEP>Angela Ganan Soto, Adam McIntyre, Sungeeta Agrawal, Shara R.

26891181,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Topiramate has been shown to reduce consumption of a variety of substances of abuse. It has been most widely studied in alcohol treatment and it reduces drinking in alcohol dependent individuals and heavy drinkers. A meta-analysis showed that topiramate's efficacy in alcohol treatment is substantially greater than that of naltrexone or acamprosate, medications that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and most commonly prescribed for alcohol treatment. Consistent with its robust therapeutic effect the rate of topiramate prescription for alcohol treatment in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System more than doubled from 2009 to 2012. Topiramate also increases the likelihood of cigarette abstinence among smokers. Some studies have also shown an effect of topiramate on abstinence from cocaine, though a recent study found no such effect.<SEP>In addition to its efficacy, tolerability is important in a clinician's choice of a medication to treat an alcohol use disorder (AUD) and a patient's decision to take the medication. Based on topiramate's actions in multiple neurotransmitter and enzyme systems, it has a variety of adverse effects, the most common of which are somnolence, fatigue, weight loss, and nervousness. Less common adverse effects of topiramate include cognitive difficulties (e.g., confusion, psychomotor slowing; decreased concentration, attention, and memory; speech or language problems), renal calculi, metabolic acidosis, and visual disturbances (including, rarely, secondary glaucoma).<SEP>In a study of 138 heavy drinkers whose goal was to reduce their drinking to safe levels, we found that topiramate reduced heavy drinking days (HDDs) and increased abstinent days significantly more than placebo. Further, in the subsample of European Americans (EAs; n=122), the effect was moderated by rs2832407, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in GRIK1, the gene that encodes the GluK1 subunit of the kainate receptor. Thus, the use of topiramate to treat heavy drinking may be most appropriate in individuals with a specific rs2832407 genotype (the frequency of which varies widely by population).<SEP>Although the only serious adverse event seen in our study was in the placebo group, patients receiving topiramate reported significantly more adverse events overall [mean=5.5 (SD=3.1) than placebo patients [mean=3.0 (SD=2.5); p<0.001] and events of at least moderate severity [mean=1.8 (SD=1.3)] than placebo patients [mean=0.4 (SD=0.7); p<0.001]. Topiramate patients reported a significantly greater likelihood of numbness/tingling, change in taste, loss of appetite, weight loss, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty with memory.<SEP>Despite the clinical relevance of the risk-benefit relationship, there are no published measures that jointly reflect the therapeutic and adverse effects of topiramate in treating AUD. Here, we calculated number needed to treat (NNT) and adjusted it for reported adverse events, using data from our topiramate trial. NNT is the estimated number of patients who must receive an intervention to achieve a successful outcome in one patient, relative to the effects of placebo treatment. We adjusted the NNT for two levels of adverse events: those of a moderate or greater severity (which may be most relevant to a patient's choice whether to undergo treatment) and separately those that received a severe or greater rating (which may be most relevant for a prescriber's choice as to whether to prescribe the treatment). Finally, we repeated all of the comparisons separately by rs2832407 genotype (C-allele homozygotes vs. A-allele carriers).<SEP>We hypothesized that the adverse-event adjusted NNT for topiramate would be substantially lower than the NNTs reported in the literature for either naltrexone or acamprosate. Further, based on the prior finding that the rs2832407 genotype in GRIK1 moderated the response to topiramate, we hypothesized that EA individuals with the rs2832407*CC genotype would have an adverse-event adjusted NNT that is lower than A-allele carriers, reflecting greater efficacy of the medication in the CC-genotype group. Further, based on a report by Ray et al., in which rs2832407*C-homozygotes showed a lower risk of adverse events than A-allele carriers, we expected that the impact of adjusting NNT for adverse events would be more modest in the CC genotype patients.","METHODS<SEP>Overview<SEP>We re-analyzed data from a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of topiramate in a sample of 138 heavy drinkers. In that study, 67 patients (48.6%) were randomly assigned to receive topiramate and 71 patients (51.4%) received placebo. Most patients were male [placebo: n=41 (58%), topiramate: n=45 (67%)] and EA [placebo: n=66 (93%), topiramate: n=56 (84%)]. The genotype distribution among EAs was as follows: 21 topiramate-treated patients were rs2832407*C homozygotes and 30 were A-allele carriers (i.e., either heterozygotes or A-allele homozygotes) and the comparable numbers in the placebo group were 35 and 36, respectively. Additional information on the study sample is provided in Kranzler et al.<SEP>Patients were seen weekly for the first six weeks to allow a gradual increase in topiramate dosage from 25 mg/day to a maximum of 200 mg/day (or a comparable number of matching placebo capsules). They were seen once every two weeks for the remaining six weeks. The Timeline Follow-back was administered to cover the 90-day pretreatment period and it was repeated at each treatment visit to estimate the number of HDDs since the last visit (i.e., four or more drinks in a day for women and five or more drinks in a day for men). At each visit, patients were also queried regarding the treatment-emergent occurrence of 19 adverse events that have been associated with topiramate treatment. For each adverse event endorsed, patients were asked about the nature of the adverse event and the level of functional impairment associated with it, which was categorized as mild (no impairment), moderate (some change in activities), severe (substantial limitations), life threatening/disabling, or fatal, resulting in a 5-point rating scale. Reported adverse events were followed until they resolved. Additional information on the study methods is provided in Kranzler et al.<SEP>Analyses<SEP>NNT is the number of patients that needed topiramate treatment (compared with placebo) to prevent one patient from having a heavy drinking day during the last four weeks (i.e., weeks 9-12) of treatment. In this calculation, patients who withdrew prior to week 12 (15% overall) were coded as not successfully treated. When evaluating the NNT, the lower the value, the larger the treatment effect.<SEP>We calculated the proportion of patients in each treatment group that reported at least one adverse event and the average severity rating of reported events (absent=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3, and life threatening/disabling=4). We adjusted the NNT separately using two levels of adverse event severity: at least one adverse event rated as moderate or greater in severity and at least one adverse event rated as severe or greater. These categories were chosen, despite being overlapping, to address patient concerns (i.e., adverse events of moderate or greater severity), which are more likely to center on comfort and safety, and prescriber concerns (i.e., adverse events that are severe or greater), which are more likely to center on safety as counterweights to efficacy.<SEP>The NNT was calculated by taking the inverse of the absolute risk reduction, the difference in event rates between the topiramate and placebo groups during the 12 weeks of treatment. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for NNT using the method of Wilson. We adjusted the NNT by the severity of reported AEs. We also performed a subgroup analysis by genotype (CC vs. A-allele carrier) within EAs (n=122) to evaluate the impact on clinical utility of the moderator effect of rs2832407. Although values of NNT are often rounded up to the nearest whole number to provide a readily interpretable estimate, we present the values carried out to two decimal places to allow comparisons with adverse-event-adjusted NNTs and with NNTs from comprehensive reviews of naltrexone and acamprosate.","RESULTS<SEP>Full Sample (n=138)<SEP>Efficacy<SEP>Table 1 shows the proportion of patients experiencing no HDDs during the last month of treatment. As reported in Kranzler et al. in the full sample, 36% of patients treated with topiramate reported no HDDs during the last month of treatment compared to 17% in the placebo group, an NNT of 5.29.<SEP>Adverse Events<SEP>The vast majority of patients reported at least one adverse event, including 96% of the topiramate group and 86% of the placebo group, a non-significant difference (χ2(1df)=3.73, p=0.053). Although most adverse events were rated as mild, the mean severity rating was significantly greater in the topiramate group [1.3 (SD=0.4)] than in the placebo group [1.1 (SD=0.5)] (F1,136=8.86, p=0.003). Among topiramate patients, 78% reported at least one adverse event of moderate or greater severity compared to 48% for placebo. Taking into account the presence of moderate or greater adverse events yielded an adverse-event-adjusted NNT (NNT-AEmod+) of 7.52. The percentage of patients reporting a severe or greater adverse event was 16% for topiramate and 3% for placebo, yielding an adverse-event-adjusted NNT (NNT-AEsev+) of 6.12.<SEP>European-American Subgroup (n=122)<SEP>The last two columns of Table 1 show the response and adverse event rates for EA patients by treatment and genotype group.<SEP>Efficacy<SEP>As previously reported, rs2832407 moderated the effect of topiramate in EAs. Among rs2832407*C-homozygotes, 57% of those treated with topiramate had no HDDs during the last month of treatment, compared to 13% of placebo patients, an NNT of 2.28. In contrast, among A-allele carriers, there was a very small difference in the likelihood of no HDDs during the last month of treatment (20% of topiramate patients and 19% of placebo patients), an NNT of 180.00. The 95% CI for this NNT (5.22 to −5.57) shows that the conditions were equivalent, i.e., topiramate had no discernible effect on the risk of HDDs in the last month of treatment.<SEP>Adverse Events<SEP>Nearly all individuals (i.e., 92%) in both rs2832407 genotype groups experienced one or more adverse events (χ2(1df)=0.02, p=0.90). Among rs2832407*C-homozygotes, topiramate-treated patients reported a mean adverse event severity of 1.3 (SD=0.3), compared with 1.1 (SD=0.5) in the placebo group, a non-significant difference (F1,49=3.31, p=0.075). Among A-allele carriers treated with topiramate the mean adverse event severity was 1.5 (SD=0.3), compared with 1.1 (SD=0.6) in the placebo group, a highly significant difference (F1,69=11.51, p=0.001). The interaction of medication group X genotype group on this severity measure was not significant (F1,118=0.83, p=0.37).<SEP>A majority of rs2832407*C-homozygotes reported an adverse event that was moderate or greater in severity, including 67% of topiramate patients and 53% of placebo patients, a non-significant difference (χ2(1df)=0.91, p=0.34). NNT-AEmod+ was 2.63 (i.e., when adjusted for adverse events that were moderate or greater in severity). Fourteen percent of topiramate patients and 3% of placebo patients experienced a severe adverse event, yielding an NNT-AEsev+ of 2.56.<SEP>Among rs2832407*A-allele carriers, 89% of topiramate patients and 44% of placebo patients experienced a moderate or greater adverse event. This yielded an NNT-AEmod+ of 322.16. Twenty percent of topiramate patients and 3% of placebo patients experienced a severe adverse event, an NNT-AEsev+ of 217.45.<SEP>Accounting for the rate of treatment completion did not change the results substantially (data not shown), consistent with the high rate of completion in both medication groups (topiramate: 82.1%; placebo: 87.3%).","DISCUSSION<SEP>Topiramate, although more efficacious in treating alcohol dependence than either naltrexone or acamprosate, produces a number of adverse effects that can limit its use. We found that a SNP (rs2832407) in GRIK1 moderated topiramate's effect in reducing HDDs, identifying a highly responsive subgroup of heavy drinkers among EAs. To capture both the beneficial and adverse effects of topiramate from that study, we calculated the NNT to reduce heavy drinking and adjusted it using two levels of adverse event severity. Overall, we found that the NNT for topiramate was 5.29, a robust treatment effect when compared with the unadjusted NNTs that have been reported for both naltrexone in preventing a relapse to heavy drinking (NNT=9.09) and acamprosate in reducing the risk of returning to any drinking after detoxification (NNT=9.09). The NNT for topiramate, when adjusted for adverse effects of the medication was 7.52 (when considering moderate or greater adverse events) or 6.12 (when considering only severe adverse events). Thus, as hypothesized, even after adjusting for adverse events, topiramate yielded a more robust alcohol treatment effect than either naltrexone or acamprosate. Reducing the risk of HDDs is clinically important, as serious medical and psychiatric adverse outcomes and elevated mortality risk are associated with this pattern of drinking. Thus, the use of topiramate to treat heavy drinking appears to be clinically useful. These estimates also compare favorably with the effects of medications that are efficacious in the treatment of treat major depression, including both tricyclic antidepressants, which unadjusted for adverse events had a median NNT of 9, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which unadjusted had a median NNT of 7.<SEP>We found that topiramate had a much more robust effect in promoting no HDDs in individuals with the rs2832407*CC genotype. In this group, the NNT was 2.28 unadjusted and about 2.6 adjusted for either of two severity levels of adverse effects. In striking contrast, among patients with an rs2832407*A allele, the NNT adjusted for moderate or severe adverse effects was 322.16 and for severe adverse effects was 217.45. These findings argue strongly against the use of topiramate to treat heavy drinking in patients with the rs2832407*A allele, as the benefit relative to placebo is extremely small, particularly when accounting for the adverse effects of the medication.<SEP>The finding that the impact of adjusting for adverse effects was much smaller among EAs with the rs2832407*CC genotype than those with one or two A alleles at this locus is consistent with the findings reported by Ray et al. They found a greater mean level of adverse effects among topiramate-treated patients who were rs2832407*A-allele carriers than those who were homozygous for the C-allele. However, we did not find an effect of genotype on the mean severity of topiramate-induced adverse effects. Thus, although topiramate's efficacy in reducing heavy drinking is greater in patients with the rs2832407*CC genotype than in A-allele carriers, the question of whether the CC-genotype group also tolerates the medication better than do A-allele carriers remains to be answered.<SEP>Although we adjusted the NNT to account for adverse effects, we did not ascertain the relative importance of the beneficial and adverse effects of the medication to the patients participating in the study. This can be partially overcome by having the patients rate the utility value of each outcome, which could then be incorporated in the risk-benefit analysis. Moreover, the severity rating may not fully capture the clinical impact of different adverse events. For example, despite a similar rating, paresthesia and visual changes may be of different importance to the patient. Another study limitation is that the sample was not very large (n=138), particularly in the subgroup analyses (CC genotype n=56, A-allele carriers n=66).<SEP>The findings reported here have a number of clinical implications. First, the NNT for topiramate (5.29) compares favorably to that of antidepressants for the treatment of depression (median of 7-9) and is superior to that of the two medications approved to treat alcohol dependence: naltrexone and acamprosate (9.09 for both; though it should be noted that the criteria on which these NNTs are based differ across the three medications, limiting direct comparisons among them). Adjusting for adverse events does not substantially alter those findings. However, the NNT for topiramate in rs2832407*C homozygotes (2.28) was substantially lower than for the overall sample or for A-allele carriers (180.00), suggesting that topiramate should be prescribed only to individuals with the CC genotype, though efforts to replicate the findings are needed. Ultimately, the clinical utility of this approach will depend on the widespread availability of SNP genotyping for use in clinical decision making.<SEP>Financial disclosure: RF has no disclosure to make.

29546524,"Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the most common and feared side effects of cancer treatment. Despite use of modern prophylactic anti-emetic regimens according to international guidelines, up to 33% of patients treated with highly- or moderately-emetogenic chemotherapy experience one or more episodes of emesis and up to 62% experience nausea. Patients experiencing CINV may be less likely to complete their prescribed chemotherapy regimen due to the significant impact of CINV on quality of life and activities of daily living. Consequently, CINV is a significant clinical problem.<SEP>CINV can be separated into acute (occurring in the first 24 hours of chemotherapy) and delayed (occurring between day 2 to day 5) nausea and vomiting. Documented patient-reported risk factors for acute and delayed CINV include younger age, female gender, greater anxiety, history of motion sickness, history of morning sickness during pregnancy, non-habitual alcohol consumption, non-smoking status, less sleep the night before chemotherapy, and previous chemotherapy. A series of recent studies have analyzed demographic, clinical, and patient-reported risk factors to develop and validate predictive indices of acute and delayed CINV. Each index yields a dichotomous risk score (high/low) intended to be used in routine clinical practice to tailor anti-emetic therapy. Nevertheless, since these indices were developed, new research has been published suggesting that genetic variation may also predict CINV.<SEP>Several studies have shown that variation in genes involved in transport and metabolism of anti-emetic drugs are associated with inter-individual differences in response to these agents. For example, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonists (5HT3-RA) are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of anti-emetic drugs in oncology and HTR3 genes code for its therapeutic target. Data suggest that variations in HTR3A, HTR3B, HTR3C and HTR3D genes are associated with the efficacy of 5HT3-RA in cancer patients; of these, the most evidence exists for HTR3B. Similarly, variants in a gene coding for 5HT3-RAs drug transporter ATP-binding cassette B1 protein (ABCB1) have been shown to be associated with acute nausea and vomiting, particularly in the first 24 hours of chemotherapy. Additionally, as a majority of the anti-emetic drugs (including 5HT3-RA and dopamine antagonists) are metabolized by the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) D6 system in the liver; variation in CYP2D6 can result in large variations in their metabolism and may ultimately affect the overall drug response. For example, CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers, who have additional functional copies of alleles, tend to report greater CINV when treated with ondansetron and tropisteron. Nevertheless, the abovementioned genes have never been examined in the context of patient-reported risk factors. Doing so could lead to earlier identification of patients at risk of CINV who may benefit from stronger anti-emetic prophylaxis such as netupitant-palenosetron plus dexamethasone or the addition of alprazolam, lorazepam, olanzapine, or metoclopramide to their anti-emetic regimen.<SEP>The goal of the current study was to examine the independent contributions of genetic variants over and above recognized demographic, clinical, and patient-reported risk factors. In addition to the demographic, clinical, and patient-reported risk factors identified in previous research, we investigated variation in three genes previously found to be associated with CINV: HTR3B, ABCB1, and CYP2D6. We hypothesized that demographic, clinical, and patient-reported risk factors and genetic variants would demonstrate significant associations with CINV in univariate analyses. We also hypothesized that genetic variants would contribute significant variance in CINV over and above that contributed by demographic, clinical, and patient-reported risk factors.","Methods<SEP>Participants<SEP>Eligible patients were: a) ≥ 18 years of age, b) capable of speaking and reading English or Spanish, c) diagnosed with cancer, d) chemotherapy naïve, e) scheduled to receive highly- or moderately-emetogenic intravenous standard-dose chemotherapy as defined by the 2011 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) anti emesis guidelines at Moffitt Cancer Center, and f) able to provide informed consent. All patients who participated in the study signed an IRB-approved written informed consent document.<SEP>Procedures<SEP>Participants were recruited between April 2014 and April 2015. Potential participants were identified using the existing computerized appointment system and in consultation with the medical team. Participants were recruited prior to their first chemotherapy infusion. Following informed consent, participants were asked to complete a baseline sociodemographic questionnaire and provide a blood sample to assess genetic variants. On the morning of the first infusion, participants completed a measure of self-reported risk factors. They also completed self-report measures of nausea and vomiting at 24 hours post-infusion (i.e., acute) and 5 days post-infusion (i.e., delayed). Electronic email or call reminders were sent to ensure timely completion.<SEP>Measures<SEP>Demographic and Clinical Characteristics.<SEP>Demographic variables assessed via self-report included age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, annual household income, and history of smoking and alcohol use. Medical comorbidities were assessed at recruitment using a self-report version of the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Participants were asked to list any non-prescription medications and supplements that they were taking over the study period. Clinical variables collected via medical record review included date of diagnosis, cancer type, disease stage, date of on-study chemotherapy infusions, chemotherapy regimen, prescribed anti-emetic drugs, and changes in anti-emetic regimens between the first and second infusion.<SEP>Patient-Reported Risk Factors.<SEP>Variables assessed were selected based on previous literature. They included hours of sleep the night before the first infusion, extent of the meal before the first infusion (i.e., liquids only, light meal or snack, full meal), history of nausea and vomiting (i.e., due to pregnancy, motion sickness, and anxiety), recent surgery, expectancies regarding post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting, and current anxiety.<SEP>Acute and Delayed Nausea and Vomiting.<SEP>The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) was used to assess the severity of patient-reported CINV. Items used in the current analyses were “your nausea at its worst” and “your vomiting at its worst” keyed to “the last 24 hours” for acute CINV and “24 or more hours after chemotherapy” for delayed CINV. Items are evaluated on an 11-point Likert scale (0=not present, 10=as bad as you can imagine). Additional items asked what patients did about their CINV (e.g., ate less than usual, took anti-emetic medication, went to a hospital or urgent care facility, received intravenous fluids); these items were selected based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.3. Responses were used by research staff to rate acute and delayed nausea and vomiting according to the CTCAE.<SEP>Blood Collection and Analysis.<SEP>Blood was collected in 10 ml EDTA tubes, inverted 10 times, chilled, and sent to the Moffitt Tissue Core for DNA purification. DNA was extracted using the AutoPure system (Autogen, Holliston, MA). DNA quantity and quality was assessed using the Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Genomics, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were centrifuged and plasma aliquoted into multiple 1.2 mL cryovials and frozen at −80 degrees Celsius. Genotyping was conducted by Cancer Genetics Inc. (Rutherford, NJ). Variants genotyped included rs1045642 in ABCB1, rs45460698 in HTR3B, and CYP2D6 *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *9, *10, *17, *21, *29, and *41. CYP2D6 results were used to categorize patients into phenotypes (i.e., poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers). A continuous activity score was also assigned with higher scores indicating more rapid metabolism.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>Participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Spearman correlations, chi-squares, and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to examine univariate relationships among demographic, clinical, patient-reported and genetic variables and outcomes. Variables examined included age, gender, cancer stage, comorbidities, chemotherapy emetogenicity (i.e., highly versus moderately emetogenic), alcohol use, hours of sleep the night before the first infusion, extent of the meal before the first infusion (i.e., liquids only, light meal or snack, full meal), history of nausea and vomiting (i.e., due to pregnancy, motion sickness, and anxiety), recent surgery, expectancies (i.e., regarding post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting), and current anxiety. Primary outcomes were patient ratings of severity of acute and delayed CINV. Secondary outcomes were CTCAE grade of acute and delayed CINV (i.e., ≥ grade 2 versus < grade 2) and change in anti-emetic regimen from the first to second infusion. Risk factors correlated with outcomes at p<0.05 were entered as independent variables in multivariable hierarchical multiple regression analyses to determine their combined contributions. Demographic, clinical, and patient-reported risk factors were entered into the first step and genetic risk factors were entered into the second step. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).","Results<SEP>Patient Characteristics<SEP>A total of 120 eligible patients who were approached signed consent (90%). Of these, 107 (89%) completed the study, genotyping was conducted on 93 patients, and 88 patients had complete self-report and genetic data. Therefore, 88 patients were included in the current analyses. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are shown in Table I. Patients were a mean age of 60 years (SD=10) The majority of patients were female (55%); white (93%), non-Hispanic (97%) and had an annual household income of at least $40,000 per year (60%). Most patients were diagnosed with gastrointestinal (34%), thoracic (27%) or breast malignancies (26%); had advanced stage disease (74%); and received highly-emetogenic chemotherapy regimens (65%). Prescribed anti-emetic medications are shown in Table II. Nearly all participants received palonosetron (99%) and dexamethasone (98%). Additional commonly used anti-emetics included prochlorperazine (88%), ondansetron (46%), and fosaprepitant (34%). Patient-reported and genetic risk factors for CINV are summarized in Table III. Most participants could be characterized as CYP2D6 intermediate or extensive metabolizers, 77% of participants had at least on copy of the variant ABCB1 allele at rs1045642, and 31% had the variant deletion at rs1045642.<SEP>Rates of CINV<SEP>Mean self-reported CINV severity and CTCAE ratings are displayed in Table IV. A total 12% of patients experienced CTCAE grade 2 or above acute nausea and 30% experienced delayed nausea. Vomiting of any CTCAE grade was experienced by 3% in the acute period and 11% in the delayed period. Anti-emetic regimen was switched in 14% of patients.<SEP>Associations among Demographic, Clinical, Patient-Reported, and Genetic Variables and CINV<SEP>In the univariate analyses examining demographic, clinical, and patient-reported risk factors for CINV, patient-reported severity of acute nausea was associated with younger age (r=−0.32, p<0.01) and fewer hours of sleep the night before chemotherapy (r=−0.34, p<0.01). CTCAE grade of acute nausea was associated with younger age (r=−0.24, p=0.02), fewer hours of sleep the night before chemotherapy (r=0.29, p<0.01), and history of nausea and vomiting due to morning sickness (r=0.22, p=0.04). No risk factors were associated with acute vomiting (p values>0.05). Patient-reported severity of delayed nausea was associated with younger age (r=−0.29, p<0.01) and receipt of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (r=−0.25, p=0.02). Severity of CTCAE grade of delayed nausea was associated with advanced stage cancer (r=−0.22, p=0.04) and receipt of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (r=−0.24, p=0.02). No risk factors were associated with delayed vomiting (p values>0.05).<SEP>In the univariate analyses examining genetic risk factors, variation in ABCB1 (rs1045642) was associated with acute nausea, with heterozygotes reporting more severe acute nausea (A/G: mean=1.91, SD=2.83) than individuals with homozygous wild type (G/G: mean=0.80, SD=2.31) and homozygous variant (A/A: mean=0.62, SD=1.96) genotypes (Kruskal Wallis, p=0.04) (see Figure I). ABCB1 variation was not associated with delayed CINV (p values>0.05). There were no associations between variation in HTR3B (rs45460698), CYP2D6 phenotype, or CYP2D6 activity score and acute or delayed CINV (p values>0.05).<SEP>Because only patient-reported acute nausea was associated with both patient-reported and genetic risk factors, multivariable analysis focused on this outcome. Results are shown in Table V. Demographic, clinical, and patient-reported risk factors accounted for 13% of variance in acute nausea (p=0.03); ABCB1 genotype added an additional 5% of variance (p=0.10).","Discussion<SEP>The goal of the current study was to evaluate the combined contributions of demographic, clinical, patient-reported, and genetic risk factors towards predicting acute and delayed CINV. Results show that incorporation of genetic factors to CINV risk assessment indices based on patient related factors has the potential to improve prediction. Despite recent advances in anti-emetic therapy, CINV remains a significant cause of morbidity in cancer patients. Our study showed a suboptimal control of nausea post chemotherapy despite guideline-consistent anti-emetic prescribing, with 12% patients reporting moderate to severe nausea in the acute setting and 30% in the delayed setting. Nevertheless, control of vomiting was high, with 1% of patients experiencing CTACE grade 2 or above acute vomiting and 5% delayed vomiting.<SEP>Control of nausea was related to patients’ sociodemographic, clinical, patient-reported, and genetic characteristics. Consistent with previous studies, we found in univariate analyses that younger age and fewer hours of sleep prior to chemotherapy was significantly related to development of acute nausea. Advanced stage malignancy and receipt of highly emetogenic chemotherapy were found to be significantly related to development of delayed nausea. Univariate analyses also indicated that variation in ABCB1 at rs1045642 was significantly associated with development of acute nausea. While these findings are consistent with previous literature, it is not clear why heterozygotes would experience greater nausea than homozygotes. It may be that this variant is in high linkage disequilibrium with a functional variant. Despite frequent use of anti-emetic agents metabolized by CYP2D6, we did not observe an association of activity score or phenotype with CINV. Lack of a relationship may be due to the fact that majority of our participants were extensive metabolizers (94%), as a result of which our study sample was not adequately powered to evaluate the CYP2D6 phenotype as a potential CINV risk factor. Similarly, we did not observe any association between variation in the HTR3B gene and the risk of CINV, perhaps due to our relatively small sample size.<SEP>Over the years, there has been development of several risk assessment indices for prediction of CINV based on patient-reported risk factors and the emetogenic potential of chemotherapeutic regimens. In a randomized control study, Clemons et al evaluated the control of CINV in breast cancer patients and found significant improvement in both acute and delayed CINV when patients were given a tailored anti emetic medication regimen based on an established risk based model. We found that demographic, clinical, patient-reported, and genetic factors accounted for a combined 18% of the variance in acute nausea, with genetic factors accounting for 5%. Our data suggest that existing algorithms may be improved by including genetic information. Relatively few candidate gene studies have been conducted to date; additional, larger studies such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are needed to provide a more comprehensive examination of genetic risk factors for CINV. The falling cost of genotyping, in combination with CLIA-certified genotyping available to providers and consumers, suggests that genotype-based antiemetic prescribing is likely to become increasingly practical.<SEP>Our study is one of the first to look at the combination of patient-reported and genetic risk factors to identify risk of CINV in cancer patients. Strengths of the study include a clinically important research question; longitudinal, prospective design; a sample that was heterogeneous in terms of diagnosis and stage; well-validated measures of CINV; and appropriate statistical analyses. Limitations of the study should also be noted. Our sample of 88 patients was relatively small and the incidence of some outcomes, such as vomiting, was low. Therefore the study may have lacked statistical power to detect more subtle effects of patient-reported and genetic risk factors on CINV. Additionally, our sample was relatively homogeneous in terms of race and ethnicity; additional studies are needed to determine whether findings can be generalized to other racial and ethnic groups.<SEP>In conclusion, the current study suggests that patient-reported and genetic risk factors may improve early identification of patients at risk of CINV. Additional studies are needed to confirm our results and systematically investigate the role of additional genetic variants (i.e., GWAS) to select appropriate genetic risk factors for tailored anti-emetic prescribing in clinical practice. Future research will be targeted towards establishing additional genetic variants responsible for inter individual variability in CINV risk, development and dissemination of risk prediction models, and evaluating the cost effectiveness of risk-based anti-emetic prescribing. Additional research should also focus on pharmacogenetics studies of anti-emetic metabolism. Improved nausea risk prediction and management would be highly impactful for the 650,000 cancer patients who receive outpatient chemotherapy in the U.S. each year.<SEP>Conflict of Interest<SEP>Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest: Dr. Li is a consultant for Novartis.

27159559,"Introduction<SEP>Lactose is the major carbohydrate component of milk and other dairy products. Digestion of lactose is mediated by lactase (LCT), an enzyme uniquely expressed in epithelial cells of the small intestine. In mammals, LCT expression initiates before birth, remains high during the nursing period and then progressively declines after weaning, resulting in lactase non-persistence. However, some humans are lactase persistent, for which the level of LCT mRNA, and consequently LCT activity, remains high in adulthood, especially in the jejunum of the small intestine. Human lactase non-persistence is the ancestral state of LCT regulation, and over 65% of humans worldwide are lactose intolerant. Despite its prevalence in humans and other mammals the molecular mechanisms mediating lactase non-persistence are not well understood.<SEP>To date, inter-individual differences in LCT expression in human adults have been attributed solely to DNA sequence variation upstream of LCT. In particular, the C/T-13910 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs4988235) found in intron 13 of the minichromosome maintenance complex component 6 (MCM6) gene is associated with the phenotypes of lactase persistence and non-persistence in European populations. Lactase persistence in Europe is attributed to the T-13910 allele, part of an extended conserved >500 kb haplotype that has been under strong directional selection for the last 3–7,500 years. This and other nearby genetic polymorphisms associated with LCT expression have been detected in other ethnic groups as well, and across populations lactase persistence originated on several different haplotype backgrounds. However, in non-Europeans, these SNPs do not fully explain lactase persistence, and certain individuals within African populations exhibit lactase persistence in the absence of known LCT-associated variants. Though reporter assays examining LCT promoter induction and gel shifts, as well as transgenic mouse experiments, support the importance of SNP C/T-13910 in LCT regulation in European populations, the reported differences between allelic variants are modest (T-13910 variant shows a ~1.5-fold higher activity compared to ancestral variant). This suggests that, in addition to SNPs, there could be other factors contributing to LCT mRNA differences in lactase persistent and non-persistent individuals. It is also unclear what molecular mechanisms can account for the age-dependent changes of LCT expression; from very high in infancy to substantial downregulation in the majority of adults. Since DNA sequence is stable, more dynamic regulatory systems must be involved in the temporal dimension of lactase non-persistence.<SEP>Epigenetic modifications of DNA and histone proteins could contribute to lactase non-persistence as they effectively regulate gene transcription, differ markedly across tissues and cell types, and also change in the same individual over time. Indeed, evidence suggests that many manifestations of aging, including age-dependent diseases, have an epigenetic basis. In light of this, we set out to conduct the first investigation examining the extent to which epigenetic processes mediate the age-dependent and cell type-specific downregulation of LCT that results in lactase non-persistence. In this study, we performed chromosome-wide profiling of DNA modification (consisting of methylation and other epigenetic cytosine modifications) using high density tiling microarrays, followed by targeted bisulfite sequencing-based interrogation of the human and mouse lactase genes in intestinal cells and other tissues. We detected changes in DNA modification densities at several distinct regulatory elements that direct the gradual decline in lactase gene expression following infancy in mammals. We then explored how genetic factors can impact age-specific changes in epigenetic marks, and found that SNP C/T-13910 containing haplotypes contributed to the epigenetic aging of LCT–MCM6. To validate the epigenetically-controlled regulatory elements for the lactase gene, we used RNA interference (RNAi) in human tissue culture and CRISPR-Cas9-induced genetic deletions in the mouse. Our study revealed that lactase non-persistence results from accumulation of transcriptionally suppressive epigenetic changes on haplotypes carrying the SNP C-13010 allele, while T-13910 containing haplotypes escape from epigenetic inactivation to facilitate lactase persistence.","Online Methods<SEP>No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.<SEP>Human samples<SEP>Jejunum specimens were collected during laparoscopic Roux-En-Y gastric bypass surgery in Departments of Gastroenterology and Surgery, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (Kaunas, Lithuania). Two cohorts of jejunum surgical samples from unrelated individuals were collected: cohort 1 (n = 56 individuals, 21–72 years old) and cohort 2 (n = 59 individuals, 22–65 years old) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Following removal, jejunum samples were immediately submerged in RNAlater (Life Technologies), kept overnight at 4°C, followed by storage at −80°C. Blood (n = 58 individuals) and sperm (n = 18 individuals) samples were collected from unrelated individuals enrolled in laparoscopic surgery, and were from separate individuals than those in cohort 1 and 2. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture into heparin-coated tubes (BD), and then stored immediately at −80°C. Sperm samples provided by participants were stored immediately at −80°C. The study protocol was approved by the Bioethics Committee of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (Protocol 2007-12-04 Nr.BE-2-55), and each patient signed informed consent to participate in the study. Human tissues were processed for mRNA analysis, DNA modification profiling and genotyping by researchers blind to any sample information.<SEP>Mouse jejunum samples<SEP>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of the Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics (TCP) and complied with the requirements of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and Province of Ontario Animals for Research Act. C57BL/6NCrl mice were bred at the TCP and housed as described in Supplementary Note 2.<SEP>The jejunum of infant (postnatal day 6) and adult (postnatal day 60) mice was investigated. The small intestine was harvested and dissected into three equal parts; the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Each of these anatomical segments was further dissected into three equal parts (proximal, middle and distal) resulting in nine dissections of the small intestine. Only male mice were used in the chromosome-wide and targeted bisulfite sequencing study. For the CRISPR-Cas9 genetically-modified mice, approximately equal male and female mice ratios were used for each group, and no sex differences in steady-state Lct mRNA were observed. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size, but sample sizes were comparable to other studies involving mRNA analysis in mice with CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutations. No animals were excluded from the study. Mice were randomly allocated to the postnatal day 6 or 60 groups. Variance was similar between groups in all analyses. Mouse intestinal samples were processed by researchers blind to genotype and experimental conditions.<SEP>mRNA analyses<SEP>Total RNA from jejunum samples was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as described in Supplementary Note 2. Total RNA from human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2, ATCC) cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). RNA integrity was verified on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies). Total RNA (750 ng) was converted to cDNA using High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Life Technologies). Steady-state mRNA levels were assayed with TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies) using an Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 Real-time PCR system. TaqMan gene expression probes (Life Technologies) for mouse and human are detailed in Supplementary Table 3. mRNA of villin 1 and sucrase-isomaltase were used as endogenous controls. RNA extraction and qPCR was done by researchers blind to experimental conditions. Statistical analyses of the qPCR data used repeated-measure (RM) ANOVA with the appropriate between-subjects and within-subject factors, followed by Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc comparisons or by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, as described in Supplementary Note 2.<SEP>Intestinal epithelial cell isolation and DNA extraction<SEP>A chelating method was used to isolate intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) from the rest of the jejunum. Since lactase expression is high in enterocytes of the intestinal villi, while low in those of the crypts, we optimized the isolation protocol to yield enterocyte fractions principally from the villi (Supplementary Fig. 1b and see Supplementary Note 2). DNA was isolated with a standard phenol-chloroform approach for each sample.<SEP>Chromosome-wide DNA modification analysis<SEP>To perform our chromosome-wide scan we enriched the unmodified DNA fraction using the mTAG-click method, as described previously (and see Supplementary Note 2). The unmodified DNA fraction was hybridized to GeneChip Human Tiling 2.0R Array (B array, covering chromosomes 2, 9 and 19) or GeneChip Mouse Tiling 2.0R Array (A array, chromosome 1, 9 and 19). Microarrays were processed as detailed in the Affymetrix ChIP Assay protocol and scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner.<SEP>Tiling array data of isolated enterocytes and enterocyte-deficient jejunum were examined for human and mouse samples. Tiling array intensities were extracted and normalized as described in Supplementary Note 2. Probe sequences were aligned to the genomes for each species (human GRCh37/hg19, mouse GRCm38/mm10) with no mismatches allowed, and only intensities for uniquely-mapping probe sequences were considered. For each sample, normalized intensities were then smoothed using a running pseudomedian filter with span of 200 bp.<SEP>Probes for the human samples were filtered using a bootstrapping procedure to identity probes that were significantly more consistent between replicate pairs than random samples of the same tissue (Supplementary Note 2). As expected, replicates clustered tightly together after this filtering step. Probes were then filtered to the 5,482 probes that were significantly different between enterocytes and enterocyte-deficient jejunum, based on a paired Mann-Whitney test at each probe and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of q < 0.01.<SEP>In the analysis of the human samples, the significance of correlation between DNA modification and LCT steady-state mRNA was calculated using Kendall’s nonparametric correlation test at each probe, followed by Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. For the mouse samples, age-associated probes were identified by performing a Mann-Whitney test at each probe and then applying the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing with a threshold of q < 0.01 (n = 2,680,563 sites).<SEP>Bisulfite padlock probes for fine-mapping of DNA modification in humans and mice<SEP>DNA modification was examined with single nucleotide resolution in the LCT and MCM6 loci of humans and mice using the bisulfite padlock probe technique. Padlock probes were generated to target the unique (non-repetitive) genome following bisulfite conversion. Probes were designed for both the forward and reverse DNA strands using recent versions of the genome (human GRCh37/hg19, mouse GRCm38/mm10). Human probes (n = 466) surveyed a ~100 kb region surrounding the LCT and MCM6 locus, while mouse probes (n = 404) were designed to cover an ~80 kb region centered over the Lct and Mcm6. Probe sequences are described in Supplementary Table 4. Probes were synthesized using a programmable microfluidic microarray platform (LC Sciences) and were prepared for padlock investigations, as described (see also Supplementary Note 2).<SEP>Fine-mapping of DNA modification using the bisulfite padlock probes approach was performed using a modified version of the previously described protocol (Supplementary Note 2). In brief, genomic DNA for each sample was bisulfite-converted and purified using the EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning Kit (Zymo Research). The bisulfite-converted DNA (200 ng) was hybridized to the padlock probes. Targeted regions were extended using PfuTurbo Cx (Agilent Technologies) and circularization was completed using Ampligase (Epicentre). Non-circularized DNA was digested using an exonuclease cocktail and the remaining circularized DNA was amplified using a common linker sequence in the padlock probe. Libraries were PCR amplified, pooled, purified by QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and quantified by qPCR (Kapa Biosystems) on a ViiA 7 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Next-generation sequencing of the libraries was done on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 machine in Rapid Run mode at the Donnelly Sequencing Centre in Toronto, Canada.<SEP>Analysis of bisulfite padlock probes data<SEP>Using a custom pipeline based on the Bismark tool (see Supplementary Note 2), DNA modification density was interrogated at every cytosine covered by padlock probes. Adaptor sequences were removed from the reads using Trimmomatic-0.32, and reads aligning to the phiX DNA spiked-in were removed. Reads were then aligned to the target reference genome (GRCh37/hg19 or GRCm38/mm10). Percent modification was estimated as the fraction of spanning reads that retained the reference “C”, and were not converted to “T” from the bisulfite treatment. Modification estimates were only considered if 30 or more reads spanned the cytosine. CpG sites were filtered for effect size (interquartile range >= 0.05) and sparsity (coverage in >= 30 samples). In the human samples, we excluded CpG sites within 1 bp of common polymorphisms called as part of the 1000 Genomes Project (phase 3, v5a release).<SEP>For analysis of the human samples, the correlation was measured between the DNA modification density at individual CpGs and relative steady-state LCT mRNA using Kendall’s nonparametric correlation test. Bonferroni multiple testing correction was then performed and CpGs were considered significant at a familywise error rate threshold α < 0.01. CpGs exhibiting cell-type specific expression were identified by performing a nonparametric Mann-Whitney test at each CpG between the sets of enterocyte and enterocyte-deficient jejunum samples, followed by Bonferroni multiple testing correction and a significance threshold of α < 0.01.<SEP>For mouse samples, the significance of association between DNA modification and age was measured separately at each CpG by comparing the modification levels of postnatal day 6 and day 60 mice with a Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. Multiple testing correction was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method with a FDR threshold q < 0.05.<SEP>Analysis of chromatin state<SEP>NarrowPeak peak calls were downloaded for 4 tracks (DNase, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac; see Supplementary Table 2) for human small intestine tissue from Roadmap Epigenomics uniform re-processing unconsolidated epigenomes from Release 9 of the Epigenome Atlas (http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/data/byFileType/peaks/unconsolidated/narrowPeak/; Supplementary Table 2). Peak calls were filtered for significance (FDR q < 0.01) and intersected with the seven LCT-associated regions in Supplementary Table 1 (using bedtools). LCT-associated regions smaller than 500 bp were symmetrically extended to 500 bp. A 100 kb region encompassing LCT and MCM6 (chr2:136,540,000–136,640,000) was scanned for potential enhancer regions by identifying all overlapping H3K4me1 and H3K27ac peaks annotated with an FDR q < 0.01. For the mouse small intestine, we obtained processed data, including BroadPeak calls, for 4 tracks (POLR2A, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac) from ENCODE (www.encodeproject.org). These originated from the small intestine of 60-day old C57BL/6NCrl mice (same age and strain as used in the bisulfite padlock probe sequencing). Peak calls were lifted over from mm9 to mm10 using the UCSC LiftOver tool, and then intersected with the interrogated 80 kb region containing Lct and Mcm6 (chr1:128,280,000–128,360,000).<SEP>Analysis of mammalian conservation<SEP>The significance of intronic conservation within mammals was assessed using 12-mer constraint predictions from a multiple sequence alignment of 29 mammals (http://www.broadinstitute.org/ftp/pub/assemblies/mammals/29mammals/hg19/hg19_29way_pi_lods_elements_12mers.chr_specific.fdr_0.1_with_scores.txt.gz). Intronic regions were defined as the intervals of Refgene regions at least 100bp away from the nearest exon and within a 100 kb region centered on LCT and MCM6 (chr2:136,540,000–136,640,000), resulting in 33 intronic intervals spanning 67,744 bp. Mammalian conserved elements were intersected with these intronic intervals using bedtools to identify 47 intronic conserved elements within LCT and MCM6 (758 conserved bases, or 1.12% of intronic sequence). The expected number of conserved bases within a 500 bp window was modeled by randomly permuting the locations of the 47 conserved elements within the intronic intervals using bedtools shuffle and measuring the total number of conserved bases within a 500 bp region, for each of 10,000,000 iterations. A set of 25 overlapping 500 bp windows were sufficient to span all 47 conserved elements, and the significance of each window was measured by comparing the number of conserved bases within the window to the permuted distribution.<SEP>RNAi technique<SEP>The relationship between lncRNA (LOC100507600) and LCT mRNA levels was examined by RNA interference in Caco-2 cells (ATCC). For this approach, Caco-2 cells were transfected with either an equimolar pool of 4 siRNAs (30 pmol) directed to LOC100507600 (Qiagen FlexiTube GeneSolution; SI05737893, SI05737900, SI0737907 and SI0737914) or a scrambled-control siRNA (Qiagen AllStars Neg. siRNA AF488, SI03650318) using RNAiMAX (Life technologies) according the manufacturer’s instructions (see also Supplementary Note 2). The siRNA or scrambled control group was randomly assigned to each cell well. After 48 h, transfection efficiency was confirmed for siRNAs conjugated to AlexaFluor-488 using an Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope and FluoView 1200 software (Olympus). Cells were then harvested and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). mRNA levels were analyzed by qPCR, as described above, to evaluate the consequence of LOC100507600 knockdown on LCT expression.<SEP>CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing<SEP>Genetic deletions in the Mcm6 intron 13, Lct intron 2 or Lct intron 1 of mice were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique, as described. Design of sgRNAs targeting these loci was completed with the MIT CRISPR Design tool. Guides were selected based on highest on-target specificity and avoided exons, intronic regions adjacent to exons (at least 100 bp), and repetitive regions.<SEP>For the Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease modified mice, sgRNA templates for in vitro transcription were amplified by high-fidelity PCR using a forward primer with the T7 promoter, the guide RNA sequence, and an anchor sequence for the pX330 plasmid (gift of Feng Zhang, Addgene 42230) and a reverse primer at 3′ terminus of the sgRNA sequence in pX330 (Primers detailed in Supplementary Table 3). The PCR templates were gel purified and used for in vitro transcription using the MEGAshortscript T7 transcription kit (Life Technologies) followed by purification using the MEGAclear kit (Life Technologies). Cas9 mRNA was produced by in vitro transcription of a T7 promoter containing amplicon from pX330 using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra Kit (Life Technologies). Cas9 mRNA (20 ng/μL) and sgRNA (10 ng/μL) were premixed in injection buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) and microinjected via continuous flow into the pronuclei of C57BL/6NCrl zygotes at the Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics, Canada. Mutation success rates were 18% for Mcm6 (n = 2 mice), 11% Lct intron 1 (n = 2) and 38% for Lct intron 2 (n = 5). F0 mice were backcrossed to wild-type C57BL/6NCrl mice and F1 heterozygous mice were intercrossed, keeping each founder line separate. Of the 9 mutant lines, we investigated only one for each Mcm6 and Lct intron 1, and three lines for Lct intron 2 (the three Lct intron 2 lines did not differ; Supplementary Fig. 8d). F2 offspring from the heterozygous mouse intercrosses were used in experiments.<SEP>For genetic modifications in the Caco-2 cell line (ATCC), a model of human intestinal epithelial cells, we opted for the CRISPR-Cas9n system, which has been shown to increase genome editing specificity in cells. We generated deletions in MCM6 intron 13, LCT intron 2 or LCT intron 1 in the human cells using the CRISPR-Cas9n protocol described previously and in Supplementary Note 2. Caco-2 cells in the CRISPR-Cas9n and RNAi experiments were authenticated; showing a 100% match to the reference profile of Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37) based on genetic analyses of 15 autosomal tandem repeat loci and the gender identity locus amelogenin (performed by Genetica DNA Laboratories). A PCR-based test using the eMYCO Plus kit (iNtRON Biotechnology) verified the absence of mycoplasma contamination in the Caco-2 cells used (performed by Genetica DNA Laboratories).<SEP>CRISPR-induced deletions in both the mice and Caco-2 cells were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (ACGT Corporation in Toronto, Canada). LCT steady-state mRNA levels were measured in the CRISPR-Cas9-modified mice and CRISPR-Cas9n-modified Caco-2 cells using a qPCR assay (described above and in Supplementary Note 2).<SEP>Genotyping and analysis of CRISPR-induced deletions<SEP>Human jejunum samples were genotyped for the genetic variants C/T-13910, G/A-22018 and the deletion in LCT intron 1. PCR amplicons were generated using the KAPA2G Fast kit (Kapa Biosystems), as described in Supplementary Note 2. Genetic variants were identified by Sanger sequencing (C/T-13910; ACGT Corporation in Toronto, Canada), restriction endonuclease digestion with BstUI (G/A -22018; NEB) or by PCR amplicon size (deletion in LCT intron 1). Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype structure between these genetic variants was examined using the Haploview 4.2 program.<SEP>For the CRISPR-Cas9 modified mice, genotyping was conducted with genomic DNA isolated from mice tail-clippings using a standard high salt method. For the CRISPR-Cas9n modifications in Caco-2 cells, genomic DNA was isolated for each cell colony with QuickExtract solution (Epicentre). Genomic DNA from mice or cells was PCR-amplified with Herculase II Fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies), as described in Supplementary Note 2. CRISPR-Cas9-induced deletion in Mcm6 intron 13, Lct intron 1 or Lct intron 2 were genotyped by surveying PCR amplicon size (detailed in Supplementary Table 3).<SEP>Off-target analysis for CRISPR-induced deletions was also performed for the mice and cell lines. Based on the ranked list of putative off-target sites provided by MIT CRISPR Design tool, we examined the most likely candidate regions for sgRNA off-target activity in both the mice with CRISPR-Cas9-induced deletions (2 sgRNA guides/deletion) and Caco-2 human cells with CRISPR-Cas9n-mediated deletions (4 sgRNA guides/deletion). A total of 46 potential off-target sites were tested in the genetically-modified mice and 172 sites were tested in the Caco-2 human cell lines (Supplementary Table 3 for regions tested and primers used). Candidate regions were PCR amplified as described in Supplementary Note 2. PCR amplicons underwent Sanger sequencing (ACGT Corporation in Toronto, Canada) and sequences were analyzed by alignment with the mouse (GRCm38/mm10) or human (GRCh37/hg19) reference genome. To display the regions investigated we used the CIRCOS program version 0.67.","Results<SEP>Chromosome-wide investigation of lactase gene regulation<SEP>To explore epigenetic contributions to lactase non-persistence and persistence, we obtained surgical jejunum samples from unrelated human adults (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and isolated villi enterocytes (intestinal epithelial cells) from the jejunum (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Across individuals there was a wide range of steady-state LCT mRNA levels; differing up to 29-fold (Supplementary Fig. 1c).<SEP>We then explored chromosome-wide DNA modification patterns in the human enterocyte samples (cohort 1, n = 56 individuals). The unmodified DNA fraction was enriched using the mTAG-click method, followed by interrogation on Affymetrix high density human tiling arrays. The arrays used surveyed human chromosome 2, which contains LCT (and the same array also contained chromosomes 9 and 19). Examination across chromosome 2 identified 5 probes that exhibited significant correlation between steady-state LCT mRNA and the density of unmodified cytosines (FDR q = 0.017, R2 = 0.28–0.32). All 5 probes clustered in a ~170 bp region of LCT exon 1–intron 1, where higher DNA modification densities associated with lower LCT mRNA levels (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). As expected, no significant associations between DNA modification and LCT mRNA levels were detected on chromosomes 9 and 19 (Supplementary Fig. 2). DNA modifications in the jejunum lacking enterocytes also did not exhibit any significant correlations with LCT mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 3).<SEP>We next investigated whether DNA modification changes are involved in the age-related decline of the lactase gene. For this experiment, we compared chromosome-wide DNA modification profiles of jejunal enterocytes of infant and adult mice (postnatal day 6 vs. 60, respectively). Similar to lactase non-persistence in humans, mice show high intestinal lactase activity at birth, followed by a gradual decrease after infancy. Indeed, we found that Lct mRNA in the jejunum of inbred C57BL/6N adult mice at postnatal day 60 was reduced by 3-fold compared to infant mice at postnatal day 6 (p < 10−4; Supplementary Fig. 4a). For the epigenetic analysis, we used the mTAG-click method to enrich the unmodified DNA fraction from infant and adult jejunal enterocytes, followed by interrogation on mouse tiling microarrays. We detected that 0.4% of probes in mouse chromosome 1, which contains Lct, exhibited significant differential DNA modification between the two age groups (11,206 probes, FDR q < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data Set 1). Of these differentially-modified probes, 30 probes mapped to within 100 kb of Lct, clustering into 3 regions: Lct intron 2–exon 3, intron 8–exon 9, and exon 10 (~60–700 bp region size; 1.36- to 2.25-fold change; Supplementary Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1). At all these regions, adult animals demonstrated significantly greater densities of modified cytosines compared to infants (FDR q < 0.01), indicating an inverse relationship between DNA modification and Lct mRNA levels. Thus chromosome-wide analysis revealed epigenetically-modified regions in the lactase gene of both mice and humans, which may be important for its transcriptional regulation and the establishment of lactase non-persistence.<SEP>Inter-individual and cell-type specific LCT regulatory sites<SEP>To complement the broad but relatively low resolution of the microarray-based approach, we fine-mapped the extended human LCT region using bisulfite padlock probe sequencing. For this, we designed 466 padlock probes covering a ~100 kb genomic region encompassing LCT (49 kb) and MCM6 (37 kb). In addition to the first cohort used in the microarray experiment, a second cohort of jejunum samples (n = 59 individuals) was added to this investigation, for a total of 115 samples (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We first examined the regions mediating human inter-individual differences in LCT. In this analysis, we performed correlations between DNA modification densities and LCT mRNA levels. In enterocytes, significant inverse correlations were detected between DNA modification density and steady-state LCT mRNA levels at 11 CpG sites (p < 0.01–10−10 after Bonferroni correction). These 11 CpGs clustered into 2 regions: MCM6 intron 13–exon 13 (~600 bp region size; R2 = 0.27–0.53), which surrounds the lactase persistence and non-persistence SNP C/T-13910, and MCM6 exon 16 (~30 bp region size; R2 = 0.20–0.25; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Table 1). This suggests that epigenetically-controlled regions within MCM6 may mediate individual differences in LCT mRNA.<SEP>We then identified regions involved in the cell-type specific expression of LCT by comparing the DNA modification profiles of enterocytes with that of the enterocyte-deficient jejunum of the same individuals. Significant DNA modification differences were observed at 35 CpG sites (p < 0.01–10−14 after Bonferroni correction), which clustered into seven distinct regions: LCT intron 5, intron 3, intron 2, exon 1, as well as MCM6 exon 17, exon 16 and intron 13 (~25–560 bp region size; 1.35- to 2.51-fold change between jejunum and enterocytes; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). The MCM6 intron 13 and exon 16 regions each overlapped the regions identified in the inter-individual analysis above. The LCT exon 1 and intron 2 regions we identified by targeted bisulfite sequencing were close to the respective regions detected in the tiling microarrays (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Notably, the region in LCT intron 5 mapped to the promoter of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), LOC100507600, while the exon 17 region mapped to 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) of MCM6.<SEP>We also investigated whether the association of DNA modifications with LCT was unique to enterocytes or could be extended to tissue that does not express LCT mRNA. In white blood cells (n = 58 individuals), the seven LCT–MCM6 regions were nearly fully modified and therefore vastly differed from those of intestinal tissues (averaged % DNA modification in blood, enterocyte-deficient jejunum and enterocytes: 73.3%±0.4%, 54.2%±0.8% and 37.1%±0.9%, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 5). This provides additional support that these regions facilitate the cell-type specificity of LCT modification.<SEP>To further explore the regulatory functions of the differentially modified LCT regions, we investigated chromatin reference maps of the human small intestine (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2) generated by the Epigenomics Roadmap. Our discovered regions in LCT exon 1, introns 2 and 3, as well as MCM6 intron 13, exon 16 and 3′-UTR overlapped with DNase I hypersensitivity sites. Moreover, histone marks characteristic of active enhancers, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, were detected at LCT introns 2 and 3, as well as MCM6 intron 13 and exon 16 to 3′-UTR. No other enhancer sites were observed elsewhere in a 100 kb region centered over LCT and MCM6. Meanwhile, LCT exon 1 had an abundance of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, indicative of an active promoter. Hence, functional chromatin signatures corroborate well with the sites we identified in our DNA modification study, further supporting the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of LCT.<SEP>Genotype-dependent and temporal changes in LCT modification<SEP>Since LCT–MCM6 haplotypes exhibit a strong association with lactase non-persistence and persistence in adult Europeans, we hypothesized that differential epigenetic modifications could occur in such haplotypes, contributing to the age-dependent regulation of LCT. To test this, we examined whether different genetic backgrounds at LCT–MCM6 led to a divergence of DNA modifications in an age-dependent fashion. We first genotyped two MCM6 SNPs (C/T-13910, rs4988235 and G/A-22018, rs182549) and an insertion-deletion in the 3′ region of LCT intron 1 in the intestine samples (n = 115 individuals). All three genotypes showed association with steady-state LCT mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 6a) and exhibited strong pairwise linkage disequilibrium (D′ > 0.9; Supplementary Fig. 6b), consistent with previous reports. Further analysis focused on the SNP C/T-13910, for which C and T alleles are parts of the haplotypes associated with lactase non-persistence and lactase persistence, respectively.<SEP>We next investigated DNA modification changes at the seven regulatory regions (described in the above sections) in enterocyte samples stratified for genetic background. We observed that CC carriers (lactase non-persistent) displayed major DNA modification differences in comparison to TT carriers (lactase persistent) in the MCM6 locus, particularly at the MCM6 intron 13–exon 13 (82.1±2.6% vs. 19.3±4.1%; p < 10−17) where the SNP C/T-13910 resides (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 6c). Our postdiction is that MCM6 intron 13 completes most of its age-dependent epigenetic changes during the first two decades after birth (prior to the age of the youngest individuals in our sample set ranging from 21–72 years old). Indeed, DNA modification changes at MCM6 intron 13 for the haplotypes containing C-13910 must occur after conception, as our investigation of sperm samples (n = 18 individuals) revealed no DNA modification differences between CC, CT and TT genotypes at this region (>94% modified in all genotypes; data not shown). It can be hypothesized that such DNA modifications are erased at embryogenesis, enabling high postnatal LCT activity, followed by their gradual regain with age in a haplotype-specific fashion. The situation with MCM6 exon 16 is likely similar, as it also shows significant differences between C-13910 and T-13910 carrying haplotypes (52.7±3.1% vs. 32.8±4.1%; p < 0.01; Fig. 3), though it amasses more gradual DNA modification changes compared to MCM6 intron 13.<SEP>Molecular events associated with lactase non-persistence or persistence do not stop at childhood or youth. In our cohort of 21–72-year-old individuals, we detected that LCT mRNA was significantly decreasing with age in the lactase non-persistent (CC) individuals (R2 = 0.2, p < 0.01), but showed no aging changes in the intermediate (CT) individuals, and a non-significant increase in lactase persistent (TT) individuals (R2 = 0.13, p = 0.2). We then investigated age-related DNA modification changes within each of the seven regulatory regions in the enterocyte samples stratified for C/T-13910 genotypes. In lactase non-persistent individuals (CC), DNA modifications consistently increased with age across LCT and MCM6 (Fig. 4). Conversely, lactase persistent (TT) individuals showed mostly decreasing DNA modification densities in MCM6 and LCT with age (Fig. 4) (except at the lncRNA promoter, where greater DNA modification associated with higher LCT mRNA). DNA modification changes observed in adulthood could be an extension of the LCT–MCM6 epigenetic processes occurring in childhood. Overall, our findings suggest that lactase non-persistence may be mediated by an age-related increase in DNA modifications at regulatory elements in MCM6 and LCT, while such elements are protected from epigenetic inactivation in lactase persistent individuals.<SEP>Evolutionary conservation of LCT regulation<SEP>We next explored the extent of evolutionary conservation of epigenetic factors contributing to the age-dependent downregulation of the lactase gene in mammals. For this, we used 404 padlock probes and bisulfite sequenced a ~80 kb region containing Lct and Mcm6 in enterocytes of infant (6 days old) and adult (60 days old) mice. DNA modifications at Lct intron 2 and 8 (similar regions to those identified in the tiling arrays) significantly increased with age in mice (FDR q < 0.05; fold changes: 1.60 and 1.25, respectively; Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4c, 7a). In support, investigation of chromatin marks using ENCODE data of an adult (60 days old) C57BL/6N mouse identified an enhancer element (H3K27ac and H3K4me1 peaks) in Lct intron 2, along with an active promoter at Lct exon 1–intron 1 (H3K27ac, H3K4me3 and POLR2A peaks) and an inactive enhancer at Mcm6 intron 13 (only H3K4me1; Supplementary Fig. 7b).<SEP>Furthermore, the LCT intron 2 region is highly conserved across mammals, and contains 7 out of 47 mammalian intronic conserved elements in LCT and MCM6 (139 conserved bases; permutation p < 10−7; Supplementary Note 1). This large degree of mammalian sequence conservation was not found in any other intron of LCT or MCM6 (including MCM6 intron 13). Thus, converging evidence indicates that LCT intron 2 is an evolutionarily old regulatory element, common in mice and humans (and potentially across all mammals) for the development of lactase non-persistence. By contrast, the regulatory regions in MCM6 appear to have emerged more recently, contributing to lactase persistence in human adults.<SEP>LncRNA involvement in LCT expression<SEP>We further investigated the contribution of the previously uncharacterized lncRNA LOC100507600 to the regulation of LCT mRNA. LOC100507600 is transcribed from the opposite DNA strand than LCT. Consequently, it follows that this lncRNA is a natural antisense transcript, a type of regulatory element that can be controlled by DNA modification, and that is increasingly recognized to alter target gene expression. We examined the human jejunum cohort 2 (n = 59 individuals) and detected a strong positive correlation between LOC100507600 lncRNA and LCT mRNA (R2 = 0.73; p < 10−9; Fig. 5a).<SEP>We next investigated the capacity of the lncRNA to modulate LCT mRNA levels. We performed an RNAi experiment in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, which has the TT genotype at SNP -13910. Transfection with small-interfering RNAs directed to LOC100507600 reduced its expression by 20%, and resulted in concomitant 25% reduction in LCT mRNA (p < 0.05; Fig. 5b). Hence, LCT mRNA levels were effectively regulated by this lncRNA in cells relevant to lactase persistence. The mRNA of the non-targeted MCM6 remained unchanged by LOC100507600 silencing (Fig. 5b).<SEP>To understand how increased DNA modification at the lncRNA promoter could augment LOC100507600 lncRNA and LCT mRNA levels, we surveyed ENCODE datasets. There was a CTCF (insulator) binding site overlapping the lncRNA promoter that was nearly ubiquitous across human tissues (present in 51 out of 52 cell lines, including Caco-2). Increased DNA methylation inhibits CTCF binding at such insulator sites, which has been shown to activate tissue-specific gene expression, and facilitate the interaction of neighboring enhancers with their target promoters. However, further investigation is required to understand this LCT-regulating lncRNA.<SEP>Genetic manipulation of lactase regulatory elements<SEP>We used the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to determine whether the differentially modified DNA regions indeed contribute to Lct regulation. For this, we deleted intronic regions in Lct or Mcm6, and measured the effect on steady-state Lct mRNA (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7b, 8a). We deliberately targeted intronic regions only, avoiding splicing sites and exons that may compromise Lct mRNA processing and stability. In C57BL/6N mice, we deleted the Lct intron 2 region, which showed evidence of cross-species lactase gene regulation, and separately deleted a region in Mcm6 intron 13, which was important to human LCT regulation. We also generated a deletion in Lct intron 1, serving as a positive control due to its overlap with a Lct promoter element. As a negative control, we measured Mcm6 mRNA levels in mice carrying the Mcm6 intron 13 deletion. We also surveyed and did not find any off-target activity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in 46 candidate regions (Supplementary Fig. 8b, c).<SEP>In adult and infant mice, deletion in Lct intron 1 as well as in Lct intron 2 caused widespread downregulation of Lct throughout the duodenum and jejunum (3- to 8-fold reduction; p < 0.001–10−12; Fig. 6b, c). The deletion in Mcm6 intron 13 yielded less pronounced, segment-specific Lct mRNA reductions (less than 2-fold reduction; p < 0.05–10−3; Fig. 6b, c). This intronic deletion did not alter Mcm6 mRNA levels, supporting that our CRISPR-Cas9 deletions specifically affected Lct (Fig. 6b, c). Compared to the other deletions, the mutation in Lct intron 2 produced a significantly greater loss in Lct mRNA in adults than in infants (2-fold greater reduction in adult intestine, p < 10−3; Fig. 6d). This suggests that the evolutionary conserved Lct intron 2 establishes a stronger control of Lct mRNA in adulthood, corroborating our above findings of aging mice.<SEP>We also examined the extent to which the epigenetically-regulated regions impact human LCT expression in cultured human intestinal epithelial cells, Caco-2. Caco-2 cells undergo spontaneous differentiation into enterocyte-like cells of the small intestine when grown past confluence. We assayed LCT expression in Caco-2 cells carrying a CRISPR-Cas9n-induced deletion in the regulatory elements in MCM6 intron 13 or LCT intron 2. We also deleted a region not overlapping a regulatory element in LCT intron 1, serving as a negative control. Cells were examined at a time point prior-to-confluence (undifferentiated, cancer-like state, day 6) and post-confluence (differentiated, intestine epithelial-like state, day 15). The deletions did not affect LCT mRNA expression in the undifferentiated state (Fig. 6e). However, in the differentiated, epithelial-like cell state the deletion in MCM6 intron 13 or LCT intron 2 resulted in a significant decrease in LCT mRNA levels (p < 10−3; Fig. 6e), supporting the importance of these regions in regulation of LCT expression in humans.","Discussion<SEP>This study reveals that epigenetic factors are involved in the regulation of the human and mouse lactase genes, and by corollary lactase non-persistence and related lactose intolerance. DNA modification studies, in combination with chromatin maps and our functional studies of mutant mice and cell lines, revealed quite a complex regulation of the lactase gene. Indeed, epigenetic modifications targeting several different regulatory elements account for species- and tissue- specific effects as well as the inter-individual variation of LCT expression. A key finding is that different LCT–MCM6 haplotypes “age” epigenetically differentially, which suggests that the epigenetic “clock” may be individualized by the genetic landscape. Our findings suggest that the lactase non-persistence haplotypes containing the C-13910 allele accumulate modified cytosines that silence the regulatory elements in MCM6 and LCT, while the lactase persistence haplotype containing the T-13910 allele displays age-related modification changes to maintain LCT activity. Since infant LCT mRNA levels are high irrespective of DNA haplotype, it can be speculated that DNA variation is not directly involved in LCT transcription. Rather, genetic variation may mediate the accumulation or loss of epigenetic modifications at specific enhancers and promoters, which, in turn, directly orchestrate gene activity.<SEP>Our study is a first step in understanding the interactions of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in the lactase gene regulation. Previous studies have reported that transcription factor binding differences co-occur with changes in DNA modifications chromosome-wide during the differentiation of enterocytes along the crypt-to-villi axis; a process necessary for LCT expression along this axis. In addition, SNPs associated with lactase persistence and non-persistence show allelic differences in transcription factor binding whereby Oct-1, in combination with HNF1α, shows a higher affinity to the T-13910 allele compared to the C allele. Recently, it has been detected that the DNA methylation machinery competes with binding of transcription factors in vivo. Therefore, the age-dependent accumulation of modified cytosines at LCT–MCM6 regulatory elements may be circumvented in the lactase persistent T-13910 allele due to its higher affinity for transcription factor binding. In addition, DNA modification differences between LCT–MCM6 haplotypes could influence the extent of CTCF binding, which affect chromatin conformation, and consequently the accessibility of regulatory elements. Indeed, our analysis of ENCODE data reveals an enrichment of CTCF binding sites at the lncRNA promoter and other regions, including the MCM6 intron 13. Future studies examining chromatin configuration at the LCT–MCM6 locus in aging individuals and targeted epigenetic editing with the CRISPR-Cas9 system will be necessary to fully understand genetic-epigenetic contributions to lactase persistence and non-persistence.<SEP>Our study helps to further delineate the principles and guidelines for epigenomic studies of other traits and diseases. The main lessons learned are 1) the required investigation the specific cell type centrally involved in the phenotype rather than bulk of the tissue or organ, 2) use of quantitative phenotypes and endophenotypes (in this case mRNA levels), 3) sites containing stretches of differentially modified CpGs were replicable and more biologically plausible than solitary CpGs (a consideration affecting single CpG detection methods, i.e. Illumina 450K arrays), 4) the benefit of cross-species comparisons which showed a partial conservation of regulatory elements between mice and humans, 5) examination of multiple epigenetic layers to gain insight into regulatory element functions, and 6) the potential for DNA sequence risk factors to closely associate with epigenetic abnormalities that together influence gene regulatory elements.<SEP>The significance of this study may extend far beyond the lactose-related phenotype and could benefit etiological investigations of complex aging diseases, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. The necessity for both genetic and epigenetic components in disease may account for why genetic risk factors without their age-dependent epigenetic “load” are harmless for numerous decades. In our study, we found that genetic variation seems to be setting up the stage, either allowing or preventing DNA modification accumulation with age at key regulatory sites. In late-onset diseases, DNA variants may become bona fide disease risk factors once they reach a critical mass of epigenetic misregulation in the aging cell. Genetic-epigenetic interactions may also be involved in the age-dependent loss of pathogenicity of risk genes (i.e. recovery from childhood asthma, epilepsy and atopic dermatitis in adults). Thus, investigation of age-dependent epigenetic trajectories for disease-associated genetic variants may be pivotal to uncovering the molecular origin of complex disease.",46854,['FOODIN']
20447925,"Introduction<SEP>Consumption of milk has been reported to be a potential risk factor for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The causality of this association is difficult to assess in the absence of randomized control trials as milk consumption is likely to be associated with other dietary and lifestyle factors that may themselves be associated with RCC. Other study designs (prospective studies and population based case/control studies) can contribute to the assessment of milk drinking as a risk factor for RCC, however these are subject to the known limitations of observational epidemiology and where done, have not always yielded corroboratory results.<SEP>A potential solution to this problem of confounding is Mendelian randomization (MR)(​,​). MR relies on the use of genetic markers associated with modifiable exposures of interest (in this case milk drinking) as non-confounded and unbiased markers of exposure (Figure 1). Assuming the genetic marker is not related to confounding features and is associated with the outcome only through its association with the exposure, then identifying an association between genotype and outcome will test the hypothesis of a true non-confounded association between exposure and outcome.<SEP>At the level of the population, wide-spread habitual milk drinking is thought largely to reflect the ability to hydrolyze lactose, the principal carbohydrate in milk. This ability is lost after weaning in nearly all mammals and for most human populations and this loss is associated with lactose intolerance. While most human populations have high prevalence of lactose intolerance, Northern Europeans tend to have high proportions of lactose tolerance. The latter reflects the persistence of the enzyme lactase into adulthood and is thought to be derived from selective pressures brought about by the domestication of livestock, generating strong patterns of advantage for this ability.<SEP>The population distribution of lactase persistence has been well traced, and a genetic variant associated with lactase persistence has been identified. This association is derived from an extended region of linkage disequilibrium (LD) on chromosome 2q21 which contains the associated variant ~14 kb upstream of the lactase coding region (LCT) in the MCM6 gene. Whilst two variants are recognized as associated with lactase persistence, the extended LD in this region places the most correlated allele on a common haplotypic background which captures nearly all variation in this region and denotes the select emergence of this variant type. There is evidence for the association of the MCM6 -13910 C/T (henceforth termed rs4988235) variant with lactase persistence and at a population level there is a strong association between prevalence of lactase persistence and consumption of milk. At an individual level, however, work looking at the association between physically assessed lactose tolerance and milk drinking has shown this relationship to be relatively weak.<SEP>We have previously reported an association between milk consumption and RCC in a multicentre case-control study conducted in Russia, Czech Republic, Romania and Poland. In this current analysis we investigate the relationship between MCM6 variation and actual milk consumption in efforts to clarify the potential for this variation to be used as a proxy measure for this risk factor for RCC. We intend to then use this proxy measure as an instrument to assess the causal nature of the association between milk consumption and RCC risk. Given a confirmed relationship between genetically prescribed lactase persistence and milk consumption, we aim to assess the association between RCC risk and the same genetic variation acting as a proxy measure for milk consumption. Assuming that assessment of milk consumption in this way will not suffer the same limitations seen in conventional observational analyses, results from this analysis provide evidence for the presence of causal a relationship between milk consumption and RCC risk. We hope also to comment on the feasibility of using MCM6 variation as a marker of milk consumption and through this make more general comments as to the importance of the genetic proxy/risk factor relationship in the application of MR.","Materials and methods<SEP>The population<SEP>Between August 1999 and January 2003, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of RCC in Russia (Moscow); Romania (Bucharest); Poland (Lodz); and the Czech Republic (Prague, Olomouc, Ceske Budejovice, and Brno). A total of 1,097 newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed RCC cases (ICD-0-2 codes C64) between the ages of 20 and 79 years were recruited. Trained medical staff reviewed medical records to extract relevant diagnostic information, including date and method of diagnosis, histologic type, tumour location, stage and grade.<SEP>Eligible controls were patients admitted to the same hospital as cases for conditions unrelated to smoking or genitourinary disorders (except for benign prostatic hyperplasia) who were frequency-matched on age to cases. No single disease made up more than 20% of the control group. Both cases and controls had to be residents of the study areas for at least one year at the time of recruitment. The response rate among eligible subjects who were requested to participate ranged from 90.0% to 98.6% for cases and from 90.3% to 96.1% for controls.<SEP>All study subjects and their physicians provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating centers.<SEP>Standardized lifestyle and food frequency questionnaires were piloted in all centers prior to use and interviews were conducted in-person by trained personnel to elicit information on demographic characteristics, education, exposure to tobacco smoke, alcohol consumption, dietary practices, anthropometry, medical history, family history, and occupational history.<SEP>Milk drinking and food consumption<SEP>The dietary component of the questionnaire comprised 23 food items, with frequency of consumption (and score) assessed for each item (never [0], <​once per month [1], <​once per week [2], 1-2 times per week [3], 3-5 times per week [4], and daily [5]). The questionnaire was repeated for two different time periods: 1) the year prior to interview, and 2) prior to political and market changes in 1989 (1991 in Russia). These scores were united into the groupings 0 versus 1+2+3+4+5 in order to yield a dichotomous assessment of adult milk consumption which represented never versus ever consumption patterns. One subject had to be excluded from milk analysis due to missing values. Information on lactose-free milk consumption was not available.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>After DNA extraction, genotyping for rs4988235 was performed by the 5′ nuclease assay (TaqMan). DNA from cases and controls were blinded and randomized on PCR plates to avoid any potential bias and duplicate genotyping performed for a random 10% of the total series for genotyping quality control. Genotyping call rates were similar for cases and controls being > 95% for both the cases and controls that remained in our analysis.<SEP>Analyses<SEP>From these samples, 953 cases and 2396 controls were available with observational data, whilst for genetic analyses, 915 cases and 2346 controls were available with genotypes.<SEP>To test for a potential relationship between milk consumption and variation at MCM6, we performed logistic regression of the dominant model coded genotypes at rs4988235 (i.e. CC versus CT/TT, non-persistence versus any carriage of lactase persistence alleles) and categorized milk drinking status. Analyses were performed both with and without the covariates sex, alcohol consumption (ever/never), smoking (ever/never), the categorical variable educational attainment (low/medium/high) and the continuous variable age. To test for potential relationships between milk consumption/genotype and RCC including potential confounders, we performed logistic regression of case/control status including the same potentially confounding features.<SEP>For analyses across all studies, individual study estimates were combined by meta-analysis. In this case, point estimates and standard errors derived from logistic regression were meta-analyzed using a random effects model using the “metan” user-written command in Stata. With meta-analyzed results, both p-values for heterogeneity and an I2 statistic representing the variance attributable to between study differences were simultaneously calculated.<SEP>All statistics were performed using Stata version 10 (StataCorp LP, 2007).","Results<SEP>Descriptive statistics and milk drinking profiles for all study participants are included in Table 1 (characteristics for individuals without genetic data, n=~155 overall, did not vary substantively for descriptive characteristics). Minor allele frequencies for rs4988235 within controls were observed to be 0.28 in Romania, 0.40 in Poland, 0.35 in Russia and 0.46 in the Czech Republic. The minor allele for all populations was the “T” (persistence) allele at rs4988235, consistent with that in southern and eastern Europe, but opposite to that observed in regions further north and west (the “C” allele was found at a frequency of 0.26 in the UK). No strong evidence for departure of recorded genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was found (p>0.05) except nominally in Romania (p=0.02). Whilst country specific MAF estimates are different, they do reflect intermediate frequencies of the order anticipated within Eastern European populations (Supplementary Table S1).<SEP>Differences were observed in the consumption patterns of milk in differing allele groups. In controls, genotype was seen to be associated with milk drinking OR 2.39 [1.81, 3.15], p=6.9*10−10. In all countries, a higher proportion of individuals reported never having consumed milk within those carrying the reported lactase non-persistent CC genotype at rs4988235 (Table 2). Tests of heterogeneity showed there to be no consistent evidence of difference in the association between lactase persistence genotype and milk drinking between countries (Table 2). Romania was the only country not to demonstrate association between genotype and milk drinking tendency.<SEP>There was an elevated risk of RCC among those consuming milk as opposed to never consumers (OR=1.35, 95% CI 1.03, 1.76 p=0.03). This was largely driven by the strong, observed, relationship between milk consumption and cancer risk in the Czech Republic (OR=1.68, 95% CI 1.13, 2.49 p=0.01) where the frequency of the lactase persistence driving allele and adherence to it was the greatest (Table 3).<SEP>Despite observed differences between the risk of RCC with differing milk consumption patterns and between lactase persistent genotype and milk consumption patterns, no substantial differences were observed between rs4988235 genotype and the risk of RCC either in analyses by country or in the sample as a whole (overall odds of RCC by genotypic group OR=1.01, 95% CI 0.83, 1.22 p=0.9) (Table 4).<SEP>Analysis of variables which could potentially have confounded results between milk consumption and the risk of RCC yielded evidence for association between educational attainment (p=0.001) and milk consumption in all countries(Table 5). There was nominal, although not systematic, representation of this relationship and others within results for country specific data. The strongest of these was for the Czech Republic where, milk consumption was associated with educational attainment and smoking (p=0.02 and 0.007 respectively).<SEP>In contrast, analysis between rs4988235 genotype and the same potentially confounding factors did not generally yield evidence of association. However, there was nominal evidence for association of genotype with education (p=0.03, Table 5), which was largely lost after country specific analysis.","Discussion<SEP>We aimed to analyze the relationship between milk consumption and RCC by employing a MR framework in order to avoid confounding and bias that may be influencing observational reports of a link between milk consumption and the risk of RCC. In this large, case control study from 4 central and eastern European countries which have intermediate frequencies for rs4988235, we found that whilst there was evidence for an association between milk consumption and RCC, the use of a non-confounded, proxy marker of milk consumption (i.e. a genetic marker associated with milk consumption levels) did not support this finding.<SEP>Our study was designed to assess the relationships between milk drinking and RCC and to bring to attention practical issues encountered in the application of Mendelian randomization. Importantly, despite its size, our study had low power to detect or reject a possible causal association between genotype and cancer. This was due to the relatively weak relationship between the genotype and milk consumption (an often ignored characteristic in the examination of lactase persistence genotypes) and the modest observational association between milk consumption and RCC: a study with approximately 37000 cases and 37000 controls would be needed to achieve 80% power under the same framework (see Supplementary material for method of calculation). Part of this impairment of power is likely to be due to a large number of risk exposed control participants (those who carried the lactase non-persistent genotype yet reported drinking milk) and this illustrates the importance of correlation between genotype and risk factor of interest in MR experiments.<SEP>A feature of these data was the apparent lack of association between lactase non-persistence associated genotypes and milk avoidance in Romania. Romania was the only country in this work not to show a robust relationship between variation at rs4988235 and milk drinking behavior. We have no prior reason to expect different biological properties within this population and this finding may indicate one of two likely scenarios. Firstly and most likely, it may be that the combination of relative small sub-sample size and errors in the reporting of milk drinking that are presenting as a lack of observed association. Alternatively, cultural pressures may be acting to force a departure from the milk drinking behavior one would expect given the presence of this variation. This is a phenomenon that has been used to explain situations elsewhere where populations contain only rare lactase non-persistence, however this mechanism could be in operation within populations of intermediate allele frequency for this variant.<SEP>A further observation of interest within this analysis was the nominal association between the lactase persistence genotype and educational patterning across Europe. Relationships between genetic variation and confounding features such as this can indicate an impairment in their use as instrumental variables through the re-introduction of environmental confounding. In this case it is unlikely that the observed trend has great impact on the overall interpretation of the lack of association between MCM6 genotype and RCC risk, however it is of interest in light of the use of rs4988235 as a population specific marker. When looking at the descriptive properties of educational attainment (Table 1), there is a suggestion for both difference between countries and the possibility of a gradient across Europe (west/east for this factor as opposed to the accepted east/west for lactase persistence). With the expected gradient in lactase persistence allele frequencies by geography (previously observed) being opposite to that suggested for educational achievement, it becomes less surprising that some level of association is suggested between MCM6 variation and this factor. However, relating to this study where there is no reliable association between MCM6 genotypes and RCC risk, this observation may not be of critical importance.<SEP>Important aspects raised by this work are sample size and what in this case may be loosely termed the “penetrance” of genetic effect. In this study of over 900 cases of RCC, it is possible to assess direct associations between risk exposure and outcome with reasonable accuracy. However, it is has not been possible to achieve this for genetic proxy markers for exposure (i.e. genetic markers predicting milk consumption) due to poor correlation between genotype and exposure. Although we do observe a lack of association between milk consumption related genotypes and RCC risk, the ability of this to comment directly on the causality of putative observational associations between milk consumption and RCC risk, is limited.<SEP>Based on evidence from the associations between genotype and both milk drinking and cancer risk, work presented here may justify caution with respect to the interpretation of associations between milk consumption and cancer risk. However, whilst the translation of MCM6 variation to lactase persistence may yield true physiological relationships, these appear not to strongly influence actual milk drinking patterns in the populations assessed and this impairs the accuracy of our reassessment of milk as a risk factor for RCC. Importantly, this work provides practical guidance for the employment of MR methods for the dissection of more complex, binary traits. An important lesson from this analysis is that in order to achieve suitable power to allow formal analysis of such an MR framework, clear effects, robust instruments and large sample sizes are required.",17620,['FOODIN']
27838552,"1. Introduction<SEP>Although sickle cell anemia is a monogenic Mendelian disorder caused by a single point mutation, the clinical manifestations of the disease include a striking phenotypic heterogeneity. The interplay of many genetic and environmental factors results in a remarkable diversity of disease severity. Increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) are known to reduce SCA morbidity and mortality due to the ability of HbF to inhibit sickle Hb (HbS) polymerization and overall reduction in the mean corpuscular HbS concentration.<SEP>Genome wide association studies have identified 3 major quantitative trait loci (QTL) with robust and reproducible association with levels of HbF. These loci are: the Xmn1-HBG2 polymorphism on chromosome 11p15; the HMIP-2 intergenic region on chromosome 6q23; and the BCL11A locus on chromosome 2p16. These three QTL account for approximately 20–50% of the variation in HbF levels in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), β-thalassemia, and even in healthy adults. The drug hydroxyurea (HU) has been shown to be an effective agent to stimulate increased levels of HbF in patients with SCD. There is limited information available whether the three main QTL associated with endogenous HbF levels also affect the induced levels of HbF in SCA patients treated with HU.<SEP>Although HU reduces morbidity and mortality in adults and pediatric patients with SCA, almost one third of patients do not respond with a clinically beneficial increase in HbF. This suggests there is an underlying spectrum of quantitative and/or qualitative response to HU induced HbF in these patients. Elucidation of specific genetic modifiers associated with HU induction of HbF may detect reasons for this phenotypic variability and avoid unnecessary exposure to this toxic drug for patients that are predicted to not respond well to the drug in advance.","2. Methods<SEP>We enrolled patients with SCA (SS) who received regular treatment with HU for at least 6 months at the Sickle Cell Center of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil. Patients were excluded if they were being treated with any other drugs that stimulate the synthesis of HbF (e.g. erythropoietin) or if they had received blood transfusion within 3 months prior to the study. The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board under the number 100585 and a written informed consent was signed by each patient or their parents.<SEP>Of 121 patients enrolled, 111 (56% female) fulfilled the eligibility criteria: age N 3 years old and been on HU therapy for at least 6 months. The patient ages ranged from 4 to 54 years of age (mean 21 ± 14). Maximum tolerated doses of HU ranged from 8.6–42.8 mg/kg/day (mean 23 ± 7.6 mg/kg/day), duration of treatment with HU ranged from 6 to 254 months (mean 102 ± 67 months). HbF was measured by capillary electrophoresis using Sebia CAPILLARYS 2 Flex Piercing™ equipment (Cap 2FP; Sebia, Lisses, France). We obtained HbF measurements for patients at commencement of HU treatment (BL HbF) and after each patient had achieved their maximum tolerated dose (MTD HbF). We calculated the change in HbF for each patient from baseline to MTD (delta HbF).<SEP>Six widely-known and validated genetic variants were selected from the 3 main HbF modifier loci: locus Xmn1-HBG2 (rs7482144); rs1427407, rs4671393 and rs11886868 at the BCL11A; rs9399137 and rs9402686 at HMIP-2. These variants have been genotyped previously and we performed comparable genotyping methods using Taq-Man™ procedure (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).<SEP>2.1. Statistical analysis<SEP>The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to check for normal distribution of the data and the Bartlett’s test to check for equal variances across samples. None of the three HbF phenotypes passed tests for normality; the Box-Cox method [T(Y) = (Yˆlambda − 1)/lambda] was used to transform the baseline HbF (lambda = −0.01), MTD HbF (lambda = 0.67), and delta HbF (lambda = 0.46) data to allow linear regression analysis.<SEP>Differences in quantitative data were analyzed with Student’s t-test and the values were given as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Non parametric values were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlations (R) between variables were tested using Pearson (parametric). The analysis was performed using the software R version 3.2.2 (www.r-project.org) with the packages “genetics” version 1.3.8.1 and “haplo.stats” version 1.7.6. Linear regression was performed to analyze the association of the outcome with the BCL11A and HMIP-2 genotypes (multilevel variables). The regression model was fitted at a genotype level assuming an additive model and corrected for age and sex. For analysis of MTD HbF and delta HbF, the model also included covariate correction for ANC levels at MTD. The strength of the correlation is reported as a beta coefficient value that is the average change in %HbF per allele copy of the respective SNP. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.","3. Results<SEP>Similar to previous reports of HU treatment, we observed statistically significant improvements in several hematological parameters following HU exposure (Table 1) in the 111 patients analyzed. We did not observe any differences in HbF between males (N = 49) and females (N = 62) at either baseline (6.0 ± 5.1 vs. 7.2 ± 6.4, P = 0.29) or MTD (18.3 ± 8.1 vs. 18.0 ± 9.4, P = 0.87). There was a correlation of baseline HbF with MTD HbF following hydroxyurea treatment (R = 0.40, P = 0.0004), indicating patients with higher baseline HbF tended to have higher MTD HbF values. Interestingly, there was an inverse correlation of delta HbF with HbF at baseline (R = −0.22, P = 0.026). All correlations were corrected for sex and age.<SEP>3.1. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis<SEP>The SNP HBG2-Xmn1-rs7482144 had a very low allele frequency in our Brazilian cohort (1 heterozygote; minor allele frequency = 0.45%) and was excluded from our study. The five other candidate SNPs were all in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and their characteristics are described in Table 2. We used regression analysis to independently test association of these five SNPs with baseline HbF, MTD HbF, and delta HbF. The regression model for baseline HbF included covariate correction for patient age at start of HU treatment and sex. The regression model for MTD and delta incorporated covariate correction for age at start of HU, sex and ANC at MTD. For each SNP, the wild-type homozygote genotype was used as the reference in the regression models. In a separate analysis, we did not detect any correlation between the 5 SNPs studied on any of the other measured hematological parameters before or after exposure to HU (data not shown).<SEP>For the three BCL11A SNPs, rs1427407 and rs4671393 were both associated with increased baseline and MTD HbF (Fig. 1). When we included covariate correction for baseline HbF, the association of the SNPs with higher MTD HbF was diminished but still statistically significant (P = 0.004 and P = 0.009 for the rs1427407 and rs4671393, respectively). In addition, the two SNPs were associated with increased delta HbF (Table 2). The BCL11A rs11886868 only approached statistical significance for association with baseline HbF in our cohort but did show association with MTD and delta HbF (Table 2). To analyze the combinatorial effect of the BCL11A SNPs, we performed a haplotype analysis of the three SNPs. We computed the haplotypes using the expectation-maximization algorithm implemented in the haplo.stats R package. The haplotype with the highest frequency had all three BCL11A SNPs with the wild-type reference allele (G-G-T, frequency = 59%) and this haplotype was used as reference for the analysis. Compared to this reference G-G-T haplotype, patients with at least one haplotype carrying all three BCL11A SNPs (T-A-C, frequency = 28%) had higher baseline and MTD HbF levels (effect size = 0.15, P = 0.014 and effect size = 0.28, P = 0.001, respectively). As in the single SNP analysis outlined above, covariate correction for baseline HbF diminished the association of the T-A-C haplotype with MTD HbF but was still statistically significant (P = 0.016). The T-A-C haplotype was also associated with increased delta HbF (effect size = 0.25, P = 0.005).<SEP>For HMIP-2, both rs9399137 and rs9402686 SNPs were associated with increased baseline HbF and MTD HbF (Fig. 2). Covariate correction for baseline HbF eliminated association of the HMIP-2 rs9399137 and rs9402686 SNPs with MTD HbF (P = 0.239 and P = 0.185, respectively) and there was no association of either SNP with delta HbF (Table 2). Linkage disequilibrium testing showed that the two HMIP-2 SNPs are in strong linkage (D′ = 0.9 and r2 = 0.90). Haplotype analysis showed that there were three haplotypes present in our Brazilian cohort. The haplotype with the highest frequency contained the wild-type alleles for both SNPs (T-G, frequency = 84.2%). Compared to this reference T-G haplotype, patients with the C-A or T-A haplotypes (frequency = 13.1% and 1.7%, respectively) had higher baseline HbF levels (effect size = 0.28, P = 0.0006 and effect size = 0.10, P = 0.0075, respectively). Similar to our observations of the individual HMIP-2 SNP analysis, the association of the C-A haplotype with MTD HbF lost significance when corrected for baseline HbF and there was no association of any HMIP-2 haplotype with delta HbF.","4. Discussion<SEP>This study examined the role of two well-known QTL associated with HbF levels in a large cohort of SCA patients in Brazil. Similar to previous studies, we found that the BCL11A and HMIP-2 are associated with endogenous levels of HbF in patients with SCA. In our cohort of patients, the frequency of the HMIP-2 SNPs was higher than other studies looking at patients with SCA. In contrast, the frequency of the BCL11A SNPs was lower in our cohort and the Xmn1-HBG2 SNP was almost absent. This likely reflects the distinct genetic ancestry of our SCA patients based in Porto Alegre, where there may have potentially been more admixture of the population with individuals of European ancestry compared to African-American or African patients with SCA. Despite these frequency differences, we still found that these SNPs were associated with increased levels of HbF. The strength of this study was that we also examined whether these same SNPs also affect the induction of HbF by hydroxyurea. Our study had >70% power to detect genetic associations with baseline HbF and >60% power to detect associations with either MTD or delta HbF.<SEP>Hydroxyurea is a well-established agent capable of inducing increased HbF production. There is little known about the factors that contribute to the wide variability observed in individual response to hydroxyurea, even when patients are of similar ages and receiving similar dosages of the drug. Previous studies found that individual MTD HbF responses are correlated with baseline hematocrit, WBC, ARC and HbF levels as well as time of exposure to hydroxyurea. In our cohort, only baseline HbF levels were associated with final HbF levels (Fig. 3). We observed an inverse relationship between baseline HbF and delta HbF values in response to hydroxyurea treatment. This suggested that, although patients with higher baseline HbF tended to have higher absolute final HbF values, the absolute drug-induced change tends to be smaller in patients with higher baseline HbF values. In our SNP analysis, the three BCL11A SNPs showed association with MTD HbF (even when corrected for baseline HbF levels) and with delta HbF. Furthermore, BCL11A may also contribute to hydroxyurea induction of HbF, independently of its effect on endogenous HbF levels.<SEP>BCL11A is a negative regulator of HbF expression. Individuals with any of the established BCL11A SNPs are known to have decreased expression of BCL11A, which results in increased HbF production. In patients treated with hydroxyurea, BCL11A expression has been shown to be reduced after patients have reached their maximum tolerated dose. This effect was most evident in patients without the BCL11A SNPs but it seemed that BCL11A had a limited role in hydroxyurea induction of HbF. In these same patients, there was no association of the BCL11A SNPs with MTD HbF or delta HbF. In contrast, we have found that, in our Brazilian cohort, patients with the BCL11A SNPs have an improved response to hydroxyurea. With no phenotype data correction or data transformation, the average delta HbF was 13.3 ± 7.9% versus 10.6 ± 8.3% for patients with and without the BCL11A variants, respectively. Although this effect size is relatively small, it is an interesting finding that warrants further validation.<SEP>In conclusion, we have shown that BCL11A and HMIP-2 are potent QTL associated with endogenous HbF levels in our Brazilian cohort. We also showed that patients with the BCL11A SNPs have a favorable probability of producing more HbF in response to hydroxyurea treatment. Genetic studies examining larger populations with SCA on HU are needed to better assess the specific variants in the SNPs we studied and other genetic modifiers related to HbF expression and variability in HU response.<SEP>           Conflict of interest         <SEP>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.<SEP>           Authors’ contributions         <SEP>Concept, patient follow-up, data collection, data analysis and manuscript writing: João Ricardo Friedrisch.<SEP>Genetic polymorphism analysis, data analysis and manuscript writing: Vivien Sheehan.<SEP>Genetic polymorphism laboratory analysis, data analysis and manuscript writing: Jonathan M.

26119737,"Introduction<SEP>Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure in the first decade of life, predisposition to solid tumors and leukemia, and cellular hypersensitivity to crosslinking agents. FA results from biallelic mutations in genes encoding proteins important for the repair of DNA interstrand-crosslinks (ICLs). Patient mutations have been identified in 17 FA genes (FANCA-FANCS) while a minority of patients have unknown causative gene mutations.<SEP>DNA ICLs are deleterious DNA lesions that covalently link DNA strands blocking transcription and replication. Compounds such as mitomycin C (MMC), diepoxybutane (DEB), cisplatin, and nitrogen mustards can generate ICLs, while naturally occurring biological metabolites such as aldehydes are suspected to cause endogenous lesions. Diagnosis of FA is made based on chromosomal breakage assays using crosslinking agents DEB or MMC. FA patient cells show increased breakage levels when challenged with crosslinking agents compared to normal cells.<SEP>During DNA replication, ICLs cause replication fork stalling and activation of the FA pathway. Removal of ICLs is a multistep process requiring activation of the FA core complex composed of eight FA proteins (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM) and their interacting factors. A key step in ICL repair is the core complex mediated monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI. Ubiquitin transfer requires the activity of an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ubiquitin-ligating enzyme (reviewed in). The FANCL subunit of the FA core complex is the E3 ubiquitin-ligase that monoubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI. UBE2T has been identified as the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and its interaction with FANCL is required for monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI. A second E2, UBE2W has been described to interact with FANCL and ubiquitinate FANCD2 in vitro, but the physiological importance of this interaction has not been explored in mammalian cells.<SEP>Activated FANCD2 and FANCI form the ID2 complex that localizes to chromatin and is required for coordinating repair at the crosslink. Processing of the ICL encompasses nucleolytic unhooking of the crosslink that is dependent on FANCP/SLX4 and ERCC4/FANCQ/XPF, translesion synthesis bypass of the unhooked ICL on one strand, and double strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) on the other strand.<SEP>Here we describe an individual enrolled in the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR) presenting with typical FA features and deficiency of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), UBE2T. Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA revealed a large paternal deletion and maternal duplication resulting from Alu-mediated recombination. In the absence of UBE2T expression, the proband cells are defective for FANCD2 and FANCI monoubiquitination, do not form FANCD2 foci following treatment with MMC, and are hypersensitive to crosslinking agents. These cellular defects are complemented by expression of wild type UBE2T demonstrating that deficiency of the protein UBE2T can cause FA.","Experimental Procedures<SEP>Study Subject/Cell lines<SEP>DNA samples and cell lines were derived from subjects enrolled in the International Fanconi anemia Registry (IFAR) after obtaining informed written consent. The Institutional Review Board of The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA, approved these studies.<SEP>Cell culture and viral transfection/transduction<SEP>Human cell lines were transformed and/or immortalized using standard protocols. cDNAs were delivered using retroviral transduction after packaging in HEK293T cells according to manufacture’s protocol (Mirus). For details see Extended Experimental Procedures.<SEP>Cell cycle, chromosomal breakage, and cell survival analyses<SEP>Analysis of cell cycle and chromosomal breakage following treatment with DNA damaging agents was performed as described. For cell survival assays, cells were seeded overnight and treated next day with DNA damaging agents. Cells were grown for 3–4 days, passaged at appropriate ratios, and counted once nearly confluent.<SEP>Western blot and antibodies<SEP>Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cell pellets in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) followed by sonication. Samples were boiled and separated on 4–12% or 3–8% gradient gels (Invitrogen) by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using the following antibodies: FANCD2 (Novus NB100–182), HA (Covance MMS-101R), UBE2T (Abcam EPR9446), FANCI (antibody raised in-house, #589).<SEP>Immunofluorescence<SEP>Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton in PBS, blocked in 5% [v/v] FBS in PBS, and incubated with antibodies 1:1000 in blocking buffer. Cells were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody. Cells were washed and coverslips were embedded with DAPI Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech).<SEP>Next-generation sequencing<SEP>Indexed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were constructed using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit version 2 (Illumina). Each library was sequenced in pair-end mode using 1 lane of Illumina HiSeq2000 flowcell to generate 2 × 100 bp reads. Raw-reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using TopHat with default parameters. Cufflinks with GC and upper quartile normalization was then used to calculate normalized expression levels, Fragments Per Kilobase of transcripts per Million reads (FPKM). Whole exome sequencing was performed as described in Extended Experimental Procedures.<SEP>PCR, reverse transcription, and RT qPCR performed to identify UBE2T mutations in proband<SEP>PCR reactions were performed using Taq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen), Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with GC buffer (Thermo Scientific), and PCR SuperMix High Fidelity (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocols and primers are listed in Table S4. Total messenger RNA was extracted using RNeasy plus kit (Qiagen). Superscript III reverse transcriptase followed by Platinum SYBR Green SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) was used according to manufacturer’s protocol and normalized against GAPDH. For details see Extended Experimental Procedures.","Results<SEP>Cellular phenotype of Fanconi anemia cell line of unknown complementation group<SEP>The subject presented at birth with bilateral radial aplasia, absent thumbs, microcephaly, micrognathia, café au lait spots, absent left kidney (Table S1), and elevated chromosomal breakage in peripheral blood samples treated with diexpoxybutane (DEB). Peripheral blood samples tested over the years displayed decreasing chromosomal breakage levels and increasing evidence of somatic mosaicism in the hematopoietic compartment, a phenomenon seen in a small subset of FA patients (Table S2). The subject has not developed bone marrow failure at the age of 16.<SEP>Fibroblasts derived from the subject (RA2627) are hypersensitive to crosslinking agents MMC and DEB in survival assays (Figure 1A–B). Chromosomal breakage levels are elevated in RA2627 fibroblasts treated with DEB as compared to BJ wild type fibroblast, although slightly lower than FA-A patient cells (RA3087) (Figure 1C–D). RA2627 cells are deficient for FANCD2 monoubiquitination (Figure 1E) while the lymphoblastoid cell line (LCLs) (RA2946) derived from blood that showed mosaicism, display normal FANCD2 monoubiquitination (Figure 1F). By immunofluorescence, FANCD2 foci were not observed in RA2627 cells following 24-hour treatment with MMC (Figure 1G). These data demonstrate that the subject’s fibroblasts display deficiency of FA pathway activation, consistent with the deficiency of the FA core complex, one of the associated proteins, or the ID2 complex, while the subject’s LCLs are phenotypically reverted consistent with mosaicism observed in subject’s blood.<SEP>Whole exome sequencing and high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization<SEP>High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of genomic DNA from the subject’s fibroblasts and peripheral blood samples did not detect deletions or duplications in the known FA genes (Table S3). Whole exome sequencing (WES) of DNA derived from proband LCLs and parental peripheral blood samples was performed. Analysis of WES data revealed a single FANCA mutation, c.2574C>G/p.Ser858Arg, previously described in FA. Normal levels of FANCA were detected by western blot in RA2627 cells (Figure 2A) and overexpression of wild type FANCA in RA2627 failed to rescue the monoubiquitination defect of FANCD2 and FANCI excluding FANCA as a causative gene in this cell line (Figure 2B–C). WES analysis identified no other mutations in reported FA genes.<SEP>Identification of biallelic UBE2T mutations in the subject<SEP>RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on RA2627 fibroblasts to assess altered transcript levels that might indicate functionally significant gene mutations not captured by WES. Compared to a non-FA patient cell line (RA3380), a marked reduction in UBE2T was detected, but not for any of the known FA genes (Figure 3A). Decreased UBE2T transcript levels were confirmed by RT-qPCR (Figure 3B) and UBE2T protein was undetectable in RA2627 fibroblast lysates (Figure 3C). However, UBE2T transcript and protein were present at near normal levels in proband LCLs (RA2946) (Figure 3B, D) supporting the presence of a genetic reversion in the hematopoietic compartment.<SEP>Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA and cDNA from proband primary fibroblasts, parental peripheral blood, and LCLs revealed compound heterozygous mutations in UBE2T (Figure 3E, S1, S2, also see Extended Experimental Procedures). The paternally derived deletion, g.202332626_202341295del, appears to have resulted from recombination of two AluYa5 repeats within the UBE2T gene (Figure S1). This deletion is expected to be a null allele, as it results in the loss of a majority of the gene including the start codon.<SEP>The maternal duplication, g.202332626_202341295dup, also appears to be mediated by Alu recombination. The maternally derived mutation consists of a large duplication of the genomic region between the two AluYa5 repeats (Figure 3E, Figure S2). Cloning of proband cDNA revealed a transcript containing the hypothesized duplication c.-64_468dup (dupEx2_6) (Figure 3E, Figure S2D and E). In this transcript, exon 6 is spliced to the duplicated exon 2. Inclusion of the noncoding region from exon 2 results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon. The c.-64_468dup transcript can be detected at very low frequency in RA2627 cells and is likely degraded by nonsense-mediated decay due to the premature stop codon. If any transcript is translated, it may produce a residual amount of the predicted protein p.A157Cfs*7 (Figure 3E and S2). The maternally derived mutation was absent in the RA2946 LCLs. This indicates that the expression of wild type UBE2T in the proband blood may be due to recombination of the maternally derived allele (Figure S2A).<SEP>Complementation of RA2627 cellular defects by wild type UBE2T expression<SEP>To prove that UBE2T deficiency is the cause of the subject’s FA, we introduced wild type UBE2T into RA2627 fibroblasts and assayed for rescue of FA phenotypes. Overexpression of UBE2T rescued cellular hypersensitivity to crosslinking agents MMC, DEB and cisplatin (Figure 4A-C). Analysis of cell cycle distribution following treatment with MMC revealed an accumulation of RA2627 cells in G2 that was rescued by UBE2T overexpression to the levels observed in wild type BJ cells (Figure 4D). UBE2T expression restored monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI (Figure 4F) and FANCD2 foci following treatment with MMC (Figure 4G). These results confirm that deficiency of UBE2T results in Fanconi anemia-T subtype.","Discussion<SEP>In this study we have identified a Fanconi anemia subtype resulting from deficiency of UBE2T. Analysis of RNA-seq data was critical in identifying UBE2T deficiency stressing that multipronged diagnostic approaches are often necessary in a genetically heterogeneous disease like FA.<SEP>We have identified compound heterozygous mutations in UBE2T, a large genomic deletion in the paternally derived allele and a large duplication in the maternally derived allele. Both of the mutations appear to be driven by Alu-mediated non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). NAHR is a prevalent mechanism in genetic disorders arising from copy number defects due to recurrent intrachromosomal recombination events (reviewed in). Recently, sequencing of FANCA deletion variants identified that breakpoints preferentially lie within Alu elements and has revealed NAHR as a major mechanism of deletion in FANCA.<SEP>The subject presented at birth with classic FA features including developmental defects and increased chromosomal breakage. The subject has not yet developed bone marrow failure at the age of 16. Blood counts are likely preserved due to the somatic mosaicism of the hematopoietic compartment. Restoration of UBE2T expression is detected in the individual’s lymphoblast cells and we have observed increasing rescue of chromosomal breakage in peripheral blood since birth. The subject’s bone marrow remains stable but hypocellular for age (30–40%) and it is unclear whether mosaicism will continue to improve the bone marrow cellularity.<SEP>The paternally derived deletion mutation is expected to not produce protein due to deletion of the majority of the coding region and start codon, while the maternally derived duplication results in very low levels of the c.-64_468dup UBE2T transcript. This transcript may theoretically produce a UBE2T p.A157Cfs*7 protein, but it is clearly insufficient to fully support FA pathway function as evident by the phenotype of the subject and the cellular defects. The subject’s fibroblasts are as sensitive as FA-A patient cells by cell survival assay and no monoubiquitination of FANCD2 or FANCI is detected. However, breakage levels are not as elevated as control FA-A fibroblasts leaving the possibility that residual truncated UBE2T may be present and active at a very low level, affecting the breakage phenotype. An alternative explanation could be the presence of another E2 with low levels of activity.<SEP>UBE2T has been demonstrated to be the major E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme required for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI. Efficient and specific FANCD2 monoubiquitination in vitro by UBE2T/FANCL requires the presence of FANCI and DNA. In vitro studies have demonstrated that a second E2, UBE2W, can also ubiquitinate FANCD2. In recent work, the in vitro monoubiquitination of FAND2 by UBE2W is demonstrated to be nonspecific, does not require interaction of ID2 complex, and is not stimulated by DNA. Additionally, ΔUBE2W chicken DT40 cells do not display sensitivity to MMC and display normal levels of MMC induced monoubiquitination of FANCD2.<SEP>Our identification of biallelic UBE2T mutations and UBE2T deficiency in an individual with FA corroborates that UBE2T is the primary E2 of the FA pathway required for the activation of the ID2 complex and repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. Deficiency of UBE2T causes Fanconi anemia-T disease subtype and FANCT will be the alias for UBE2T. Future evaluation of FA patients with unknown gene mutations should include complementation studies of UBE2T.",15391,['FOODIN']
19765279,"Background<SEP>Protein synthesis is essential to the survival and growth of cells. Ribosomes, the sites where translation occurs, therefore play a fundamental role in cell biology. In human cells, ribosome biogenesis occurs in the nucleolus: it requires the transcription of four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) species and their assembly with 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs) in order to produce the small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunits. These subunits are independently exported to the cytoplasm and joined to obtain mature ribosomes.<SEP>Several inherited or acquired bone marrow failure syndromes are due to mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis. They include Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA, MIM#105650), Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS, MIM#260400), dyskeratosis congenita (DC, MIM#127550, #305000, #224230) and 5q- syndrome (MIM#153550). DBA is an inherited erythroid hypoplasia which usually develops within the first year of life and is characterised by a severe normochromic macrocytic anaemia caused by a defect in the maturation of erythroid progenitors. Haematological signs include paucity of bone marrow progenitors, reticulocytopenia, elevated erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity and high levels of foetal haemoglobin. Patients are prone to develop malignancies and one third of them present congenital abnormalities. Mutations causing DBA have been found so far in six RP genes, encoding both small and large subunit components: RPS19 (in 25% of cases), RPS24 (2%), RPS17 (one case), RPL35A (2%), RPL5 (9%) and RPL11 (6.5%), overall accounting for about 50% of cases. All patients are heterozygous with respect to mutations and haplo-insufficiency is thought to be responsible for the pathogenetic mechanism of the disease. The main hypothesis to explain DBA implies that a defect in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis would trigger apoptotic processes in erythroid progenitors. This is supported by several studies showing that mutations in RPs impair rRNA processing, both in CD34+ cells from DBA patients and in erythroid cells with knock-down of the known DBA genes. Mutations in different genes impair different steps of rRNA maturation, but they all lead to the accumulation of rRNA precursors and to a reduction in mature ribosomes. Similar alterations have also been demonstrated in yeast and human cells deficient for other RPs, not yet found mutated in DBA. However, the link between the haplo-insufficiency of an RP and the erythroid defect occurring in DBA has not been clarified yet.<SEP>DBA has been considered a disease that affects only erythroid progenitors and thus the prototype of a pure erythroid aplasia. However, several lines of evidence suggest that erythroid progenitors, though apparently more sensitive to RP haplo-insufficiency than other cell types, are not the only cell type affected in DBA. Some patients evolve trilinear aplasia, showing that haematopoiesis in general can be affected, while the presence of congenital malformations demonstrates that some organogenetic processes are affected by DBA mutations. Moreover, patients show short statures well below their genetic potentials.<SEP>To gain a better insight into the biological processes and functions involved in the pathogenesis of DBA, we performed a global gene expression analysis of fibroblasts isolated from DBA patients carrying mutations in RPS19. Our data reveal for the first time the presence of abnormal gene expression in non-haematopoietic DBA cells. Protein synthesis, nucleotide and amino acid metabolism and apoptosis are the most affected biological processes.","Methods<SEP>Patients and cell culture<SEP>This study was performed on four DBA patients, carrying two missense (p.Arg62Trp and p.Arg101His), one frameshift and a splice site mutations (c.58delG and c.1-1G>A), respectively, in RPS19. Table 1 reports the main clinical characteristics of these patients. Further information about these mutations and their functional characterisation may be found in and in the DBA genes Database.<SEP>Research was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Dermal biopsies were obtained from the four DBA patients and from six healthy controls after informed consent during surgery for medical reasons that were not connected with this study. Fibroblasts were cultured in IMDM (Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium) supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine, 10% foetal calf serum, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C and 5% CO2. Total RNA was extracted from 106 cells upon reaching 80% confluence, within 2-5 tissue culture passages.<SEP>RNA isolation, microarray processing and data analysis<SEP>Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions, and purified with the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). The quality of total RNA was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). RNA was quantified with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). A 6 μg-amount of each total RNA sample was labelled according to the standard one-cycle amplification and labelling protocol developed by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). Labelled cRNA was hybridised on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Arrays containing over 18,000 transcripts. Hybridized arrays were stained and washed (GeneChip Fluidics Station 450) and then scanned (GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G). Cell intensity values and probe detection calls were computed from the raw array data using the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS). Further data processing was performed in the R computing environment using packages from the BioConductor software project. Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA) normalisation was applied. Normalised data were then filtered based on the Affymetrix detection call, so that only probes that had a Present call in at least one of the arrays were retained. Probes with low intensity values (less than 100) in all arrays were also excluded from statistical analysis. Data were then imported into the MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) software, and statistical analysis was performed with the SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) module, implemented as in. A False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 3% was applied to detect significantly differentially expressed genes in DBA patients versus healthy controls. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with Accession Number GSE14335.<SEP>Validation of data by real time RT-PCR<SEP>Genes to be validated were selected on the basis of potential interest and as representative of a wide range of expression fold changes in patients relative to controls. 500 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems) and random primers. Quantitative PCR was performed with an AbiPrism7000 instrument (Applied Biosystems) and 1 μl of cDNA was used in a 25-μl final volume reaction containing Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and specific primers (see additional file 4: Primers used in the expression analysis by qRT-PCR). cDNA from each sample was examined in triplicate in each experiment. Experimental Ct values were normalised to beta actin, used as endogenous control. Gene expression was calculated in each sample relative to the mean of controls, using the formula 2-ddCt, where dCt is Ctgene-Ctendo and ddCt is dCtsample- mean dCtcontrols. Differences in gene expression of patients relative to controls were statistically evaluated by t test for independent samples.<SEP>Mutation analysis<SEP>DBA patient 3 was further analyzed for exon 2 skipping in RPS19 transcript. The coding sequence spanning exon 1 and exon 4 was PCR-amplified by standard procedures. PCR products were excised from agarose gel, purified with HiYield Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction Kit (Real Biotech, Banqiao City, Taiwan) and sequenced in both directions using a Big Dye Terminator® v1.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and an Abi PRISM® 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are available upon request.","Results<SEP>Gene expression profiling of cells from DBA patients<SEP>To identify genes associated with a defect of RPS19, a whole genome expression profiling study was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Arrays which allow the screening of 18,400 transcripts, including 14,500 well-characterised genes. We analysed the gene expression profiles of dermal fibroblasts isolated from four DBA patients carrying mutations in RPS19, in comparison to those obtained from six healthy individuals. Of the 22,227 probes present on the chip, 13,396 had Affymetrix ""Present"" detection calls and intensity values more than 100 in all arrays and have been used for data analysis. A list of 490 statistically significantly differentially expressed probes was generated, 215 of which are up-regulated and 275 down-regulated in DBA patients (see additional file 1: Genes differentially expressed in DBA patients identified by microarray profiling). These probes correspond to 421 differentially expressed genes (176 up-regulated and 245 down-regulated) in patients compared to controls.<SEP>We also evaluated whether the observed differences in gene expression may be due to a gender-dependent bias. The comparison between the array data of female to male individuals irrespective of the health status yielded a list of 33 differentially expressed probes (six up-regulated and 27 down-regulated in females), corresponding to genes mainly located on chromosomes X or Y (see additional file 2: Differentially expressed genes in females relative to males). Moreover, we identified only five differentially expressed genes in female DBA patients relative to male DBA patients (see additional file 3: Differentially expressed genes in female patients relative to male patients). These results rule out the presence of gender-dependent defects in DBA patients.<SEP>Microarray analysis was performed on samples from patients carrying two missense (p.Arg62Trp and p.Arg101His), one frameshift and one splice site mutations (c.58delG and c.1-1G>A) in RPS19 (table 1). We did not identify any gene showing a statistically significant differential expression in patients with missense mutations compared to other mutation types, indicating that changes due to the specific nature of the mutational status were not found in our study.<SEP>Microarray analysis did not show any statistically significant difference in the mean expression of RPS19 when the group of patients is compared to the group of controls. This is due to the fact that two patients carried missense mutations that are expressed similarly to controls. Inspection of the microarray data relative to each patient showed that patient 4 with the frameshift mutation c.del58G had reduced RPS19 levels (fold change 0.68) as expected by activation of NMD. A slightly reduced RPS19 expression was found also in patient 3 carrying mutation c.1-1G>A (fold change 0.84). This was confirmed by qRT-PCR with a fold change of 0.76 as compared to five controls (data not shown). Mutation c.1-1G>A affects intron 1 acceptor splice site and is expected to cause exon 2 skipping. PCR using primers complementary to exon 1 (forward) and exon 4 (reverse) revealed the presence of two amplicons of 628 and 557 bp in patient 3 (figure 1a). Sequencing of PCR products confirmed that the smaller abnormal transcript lacks exon 2 which contains the canonical ATG (figure 1b). The first available ATG at position 96-98 in exon 3 is out-of-frame (nucleotide numbering uses the A of the ATG translation initiation start site as nucleotide 1): this transcript is expected to be degraded by NMD. However, we cannot rule out that the use of the in-frame ATG at codon 75 in exon 4 would generate a short protein of 71 aminoacids. Either way, a loss of function effect is expected to occur by this mutation in agreement with the assumed haploinsufficiency theory of DBA pathogenesis.<SEP>Biological processes altered in DBA patients<SEP>In order to systematically detect impaired biological processes and molecular functions, we analysed the dataset of genes differentially expressed in patients relative to controls through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. The analysis identified a statistically significant enrichment of genes that belong to the following pathways (table 2): aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (LARS, WARS, GARS, SARS, QARS, EPRS), glycine, serine and threonine metabolism (PSAT1, PHGDH, GARS, CTH, SARS, SHMT2), death receptor signaling (CASP9, NFKBIA, NFKBIE, APAF1, NFKB2, NFKB1, BIRC3), role of PKR in interferon induction and antiviral response (CASP9, NFKBIA, NFKBIE, APAF1, NFKB2, NFKB1) and RAR activation (SRC, PRMT2, RDH11, ADCY3, PRKACA, NFKB2, NFKB1, MAPKAPK2, RBP1, MMP1, PTEN). In addition, analysis of the molecular function of the annotated genes revealed enrichment of gene clusters with roles in protein synthesis, including a large cluster of RP genes (RPL22, RPL27A, RPL29, RPL31, RPL14, RPL18A, RPS3, RPL18, RPL13, RPL3, RPL34, RPS2, RPS12, RPL15, RPL28), cell death, cellular development, lipid metabolism and molecular transport. Additionally, we identified clusters of genes belonging to the ""Top Bio Functions"" category of molecular and cellular functions (table 3) and diseases and disorders, which comprises cancer related genes, as well as genes involved in haematological, immunological, renal and skeletal disorders (table 4). Finally, we observed enriched clusters of genes related to the development and function of embryonic, skeletal and connective tissues (table 5).<SEP>Quantitative RT-PCR validation of microarray data<SEP>In order to corroborate the microarray gene expression results, we selected seven genes among those differentially expressed in DBA patients relative to controls. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on the same RNA samples used for microarray analysis. The expression of AMPD3, CCND2, SOD2, TNFAIP3 (up-regulated in DBA patients) and COMP, WARS and ZIC1 (down-regulated in DBA patients) was tested. All genes were found to be differentially expressed in patients relative to controls and data are statistically significant (figure 2a). The correlation between qRT-PCR and microarray data is 0.7 (figure 2b), which corresponds to the value obtained in similar studies. Figure 2c shows the comparison of fold changes from qRT-PCR and microarray analysis. Microarray data showed the same trend as qRT-PCR results for all the examined genes in each sample, as represented in figure 3. These data overall indicate that the expression patterns detected by microarray analysis are in good agreement with those detected by qRT-PCR and validate our study.","Discussion<SEP>The most prominent feature in DBA is anaemia due to paucity of erythroid progenitors. However, other cellular types also display molecular alterations. Lymphocytes from patients show reduced proliferation and impaired translational rates irrespective of the nature of the mutation. An abnormal proliferation rate has been found also in fibroblasts from patients with mutations in RPS19. Additionally, both lymphocytes and fibroblasts are characterised by impaired pre-rRNA processing with accumulation of 21S species. Fibroblasts show abnormal nucleoli, which have irregular shape and disorganised dense fibrillar centers, the compartments where early pre-ribosome maturation takes place.<SEP>To characterise the molecular abnormalities in DBA non-haematopoietic cells, we evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts isolated from DBA patients carrying mutations in RPS19. Patients 1 and 2 carried mutations leading to amino acid substitutions (p.Arg62Trp and p.Arg101His), the mutation in patient 3 (c.1-1G>A) impairs the correct splicing of the first intron and abrogates the ATG start codon, whereas the mutation in patient 4 (c.del58G) causes a frameshift of the open reading frame with insertion of a premature stop codon. Regardless of the heterogeneity of the mutational types, we did not observe any significant difference when missense cases were compared to the other mutations, although this may be due to the limited number of patient samples of each mutational class in our study.<SEP>Gene expression profiling has been previously performed on bone marrow CD34+ cells isolated from three DBA patients with mutations in RPS19 and in remission from the disease (i.e. without any treatment for at least 10 years), compared with healthy controls, and on CD4+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two DBA patients with unknown mutations compared with two acquired aplastic anaemia patients. Our study demonstrates for the first time a global alteration of several biological processes in non-haematopoietic DBA cells. In agreement with previous studies, we identified a cluster of 22 ribosomal protein genes down-regulated in DBA patients relative to controls. Patients exhibit significant down-regulation of genes encoding proteins important for translation, including several eukaryotic translation initiation factors (EIF3, EIF2, EIF4E), EIF3 and EIF4 interacting proteins (EIF3S6IP and EIF4EBP1) and the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 δ (EEF1D). This may be caused either by the co-regulated transcription of RP genes or by their coordinated post-transcriptional regulation.<SEP>Most interestingly, among down-regulated genes we identified a large cluster of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (QARS, EPRS, SARS, GARS, LARS, WARS). Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARS) catalyse the aminoacylation of their cognate tRNAs and thus are key enzymes to maintain the fidelity of protein synthesis. In mammals, additional cofactors, i.e. proteins p18, p38 and p43, and interacting core proteins are required to form a functional multisynthetase complex. The gene encoding p18 (CDKN2C) is also down-regulated in DBA fibroblasts. Moreover, ARS contribute to the regulation of amino acid metabolism, which is tightly regulated and essential for ribosome biogenesis and function. Human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS) is up-regulated after IFN-gamma treatment, together with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the enzyme responsible for tryptophan degradation, thus creating a pool of Trp-tRNA and providing a reservoir of Trp available for protein synthesis. Interestingly, haem stimulates Trp catabolism enhancing both IDO and WARS enzymatic activities. An abnormal haem catabolism has been suggested to occur in DBA. Finally, non canonical functions have been proposed for glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) in the translational regulation of specific genes containing a GAIT element in the 3'UTR. We demonstrate here that these key regulators are defective in fibroblasts from DBA patients. This suggests that a differential regulation of specific mRNAs may have a role in DBA.<SEP>High levels of erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity are a common clinical feature in DBA patients, suggesting that adenine catabolism is stimulated. This most likely happens since DBA cells show the impaired processing of rRNA precursor species, which markedly accumulate in the nucleoli and need to be degraded. Interestingly, we observed an increased expression of adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD3), an enzyme of nucleotide break-down involved in the regulation of energetic metabolism in mammalian cells. It catalyses the irreversible deamination of adenylic acid and represents a branchpoint of adenylate nucleotides catabolism, regulating the size of the purine nucleotide pool. The maintenance of an appropriate intracellular purine nucleotide concentration range is necessary for cell survival. The increased expression of AMPD3 may indicate the need to dispose of an excess purine pool in DBA fibroblasts.<SEP>About 4% of DBA patients develop cancer, most frequently acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and osteosarcoma. This prevalence is much higher than that in the general population. Thus DBA patients seem to have an increased risk of developing malignancies. Gene expression analysis performed on fibroblasts from DBA patients revealed dysregulation of genes involved in cell death and cancer. The decrease in pro-apoptotic (CASP9, APAF1) and oncosuppressor genes (PTEN), coupled to the increased expression of some oncogenes (SRC, CYLD) and pro-survival genes (CALR) may suggest a predisposition for RPS19 mutated fibroblasts to carcinogenesis. It is interesting to note that several zebrafish lines carrying heterozygous mutations for RP genes are also prone to develop malignancies.<SEP>Finally, patient fibroblasts differentially express several genes involved in embryonic and tissue development, including ZIC1, strongly down-regulated in patients. In mice, deletion of zic1 gene results in cerebellar malformations and axial skeletal abnormalities. It is worthwhile stressing that 30-48% of DBA patients display congenital malformations, including abnormalities affecting the skeletal axis, such as preaxial polydactily.",21192,['FOODIN']
28150221,"Review<SEP>Background<SEP>Migraine, characterized by recurrent headaches accompanying autonomic symptoms, is the 6th leading cause of global years lived with disability (YLDs) according to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. The pathological mechanisms of migraine are very complex. Existing evidences have revealed its association with central sensitization, cortical spreading depression, trigeminovascular system activation and neurogenic inflammation.<SEP>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most abundant neurotrophin in the brain. Previous study has recognized it as an important modulator of central and peripheral nociceptive pathways. It distributes in both spinal and supra-spinal levels, contributing to central sensitization. Also it is co-expressed with Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), an important molecule of migraine, in the trigeminal ganglion neurons. Moreover, significant increase of serum BDNF level was detected in migraine attack patients. Therefore, the alteration in BDNF metabolism may be contribute to the mechanism of migraine.<SEP>The Val66Met (rs6265) polymorphism is the most common and studied variant of BDNF gene. It can disrupt the release of mature BNDF and contribute to migraine. Meanwhile, the rs2049046 polymorphism was also found to be associated with migraine. It may influence the transcription of BDNF gene to induce migraine.<SEP>The association between BDNF gene variant and migraine attracts more and more attention in recent years. However, their roles among the disorder sufferers are still not well established. Then we systematically searched and analyzed the available studies to address these issue.","Methods<SEP>Literature-search strategy<SEP>The literature search was performed in October 2016 without restriction of language, region and publication type. PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were systematically searched to identify all relevant studies. The following terms and their combinations were searched in title and/or abstract: BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, polymorphism, migraine and headache. The reference lists of included studies and review articles were manually searched to find relevant studies. The search was conducted independently by two of the authors (Cai and Shi). If the same group of participants was studied for more than one times, the latest publication was included.<SEP>Inclusion and exclusion criteria<SEP>Studies investigating the association between BNDF polymorphism and migraine were evaluated. The following inclusion criteria were applied to select eligible studies: (1) independent case–control study evaluated the association between BDNF polymorphism and migraine; (2) BDNF rs6265 (G/A) polymorphism and/or rs2049046 (A/T) polymorphism were evaluated; (3) migraine diagnosis should met the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria; (4) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) must be performed; (5) genotype data of cases and controls must be available. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) no controls; (2) reviews, comments and animal studies.<SEP>Data extraction and quality assessment<SEP>Data from included studies was extracted and summarized independently by two of the authors (Cai and Shi). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion and reexamination. The following information was extracted prospectively: first author, publish year, country, ethnicity, age, sex, number of cases and controls, frequency of available genotype, genotype method and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) evidence in controls.<SEP>The quality of included studies was evaluated independently through the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) by two of the authors (Cai and Shi). NOS is composed of eight assessment items for quality appraisal, with score ranging from 0–9. According to the NOS scores, the included studies were classified as low-quality study (0–4), moderate-quality study (5–6) and high-quality study (7–9). Any disagreement was resolved by the senior authors (Fang and Zhang).<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>The strength of the association between BDNF genetic polymorphism and migraine was calculated using odds ratio (OR), with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). BDNF rs6265 (G/A) polymorphism and rs2049046 (A/T) polymorphism were evaluated separately in the allele model, dominant model, recessive model and additive model. Heterogeneity among studies was examined through Chi squared-based Q-test and I2 test. The heterogeneity difference was regarded significant when p < 0.1 in Q test or I2 > 50%. If there was heterogeneity among studies, random-effects model (DerSimonian Laird method) was applied to calculate the summary OR, otherwise, the fixed-effects model (Mantel-Haenszel method) was used. The Z-test was used to assess the significance of pooled OR, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.<SEP>One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of a single study on the overall result. Begg’s test and Egger’s test were applied to assess publication bias. All p values were two tailed. All of the meta-analysis were conducted using STATA 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).","Results<SEP>A total of 89 studies were identified through searching in PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Four studies with 1598 cases and 1585 controls fulfilling the predefined inclusion criteria were included in the current meta-analysis (Fig. 1). Among them, agreement between two reviewers was 98% for study selection and 95% for quality assessment of studies. <SEP>Characteristics of eligible studies<SEP>The characteristics of included studies were shown in Table 1. The genotype and allele frequency of included studies were shown in Table 2. All the included cases were from five Caucasian population groups, two of which came from the Australian-based independent cohorts. The five groups received BDNF rs6265 (G/A) polymorphism analysis, and four of them got rs2049046 (A/T) polymorphism assessment. All SNPs of included studies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The NOS score of the studies were no less than 6, showing good quality. The frequency of rs6265 G allele in BDNF gene was about 80%, which was consistent with previous finding.  <SEP>Meta-analysis between BNDF gene polymorphism and migraine<SEP>BDNF rs6265 (G/A) polymorphism in migraine<SEP>The main results and heterogeneity between rs6265 (G/A) polymorphism and migraine were shown in Tables 3 and 4. The fixed-effects model was used for all analysis, for their heterogeneity were not significant.  <SEP>The overall data showed significant association between rs6265 polymorphism and migraine in allele model (OR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.76–0.99, p = 0.03), recessive model (OR = 0.84, 95%CI: 0.72–0.98, p = 0.03) and additive model (GG vs GA: OR = 0.85, 95%CI: 0.72–1.00, p = 0.04). The association was not significant in dominant model (OR = 0.85, 95%CI: 0.56–1.28, p = 0.42) or additive model (GG vs AA: OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.53–1.22, p = 0.31) (Table 4 and Fig. 2). <SEP>BDNF rs2049046 (A/T) polymorphism in migraine<SEP>The results and heterogeneity between rs2049046 (A/T) polymorphism and migraine were in Tables 3 and 4. Heterogeneity differences were not significant among all the studies. And the fixed-effects model was used.<SEP>The data indicated significant association between rs2049046 (A/T) polymorphism and migraine in allele model (OR = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.79–0.98, p = 0.02), recessive model (OR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.67–0.96, p = 0.02) and additive model (AA vs TT: OR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.57–0.92, p = 0.008; AA vs AT: OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.67–0.99, p = 0.03). No significant association was revealed in dominant model (OR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.75–1.06, p = 0.18) (Table 4 and Fig. 3). <SEP>Sensitivity analysis and publication bias<SEP>In the sensitivity analysis, there was no change of statistical significance in our analysis when any single study was omitted. Both Begg’s test and Egger’s test indicated that there was no publication bias in our meta-analysis (P > 0.05).","Discussion<SEP>This meta-analysis evaluated the association between BDNF gene polymorphism and migraine and showed that BNDF rs6265 (G/A) and rs2049046 (A/T) polymorphism were associated with migraine in Caucasian population.<SEP>BDNF, which is associated with the pathogenesis of migraine, shares a wide distribution in central nervous system, such as hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. It can modulate synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, neural growth and differentiation. This molecule is synthesized by tyrosine kinase A-positive sensory neurons and acts through TrkB receptors in the nociceptive pathways. Genetic study discovered that BDNF gene is composed of 11 exons that are alternatively spliced to encode different transcripts. Previous studies found that central BDNF can cause neuroplasticity and interact with molecules related to migraine. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid BDNF level elevated in patient with migraine attack. Meanwhile, platelets BDNF level decreased in this sufferers. These findings indicate that alteration of BDNF was responsible for migraine.<SEP>The rs6265 polymorphism is a G to A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of BDNF gene at nucleotide 196. It is located in the 5’ pro-protein region of BDNF, resulting in the replacement of the Val66 in the pro-BDNF sequence with a Met. Previous eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus) study has confirmed the association between BDNF Val66Met variant and mRNA level in whole peripheral blood in European. Subjects with Val66 displayed a significantly higher BDNF mRNA expression level compared with subjects with Met66 variant. Also, Met BDNF form cannot be sorted from Golgi to appropriated secretory granules, consequently impairing the secretion function of BDNF. Thus the rs6265 polymorphism can modify the level of BDNF mRNA and the intracellular packaging of pro-BDNF, to finally affect the secretion of mature protein. And the change of BDNF level and neurotrophic-induced neural plasticity could affect the trigeminal pain-related evoked responses and cortical pain processing. Several studies have evaluated the role of rs6265 polymorphism in migraine. However, the intrinsic effects were not thoroughly demonstrated. In this analysis, we confirm this supposition that rs6265 polymorphism may be associated with migraine. The associations between rs6265 polymorphism and this disease in allele, recessive and additive models were all in borderline significant. Consistent with our results, Salih et al. found a borderline significant difference of rs6265 polymorphism in migraine patients, demonstrating a positive correlation between BDNF rs6265 polymorphism and migraine. Di Lorenzo C et al. found that rs6265 polymorphism was associated with monthly drug consumption in medication overuse headache patients, indicating its role in migraine chronicity. Moreover, we found this positive association though enlarging the sample size by combining similar studies. So previous studies with negative results may be due to insufficient sample sizes.<SEP>The rs2049046 polymorphism is located at 5’ end of the BDNF gene, upstream to a region that contains obesity-associated SNPs. It may influence the tissue-specific transcription or levels of BDNF, thus regulating migraine. In the present study, we revealed that individuals carrying rs2049046 T allele might be more susceptive to develop migraine. This finding is consistent with two other studies conducted by Sutherland et al. and Lemos et al.. However, the potential role of rs2049046 polymorphism in the process of BDNF formation and secretion required further investigation. Basic studies on the biological functions of rs2049046 polymorphism and its correlation with migraine are needed.<SEP>The studies included were all moderate-high quality, providing a reliable basis for the current analysis. No relative case–control studies were excluded from our analysis. No evidence of public bias was detected in our meta-analysis and the heterogeneity between different studies was insignificant. However, the number of studies included in our meta-analysis was limited. Meanwhile, all the cases were from Caucasian population, and the G allele frequency of BDNF gene rs6265 polymorphism was found to be different between Caucasian (80%) and Asian (56%) population, making our results be unappropriated for Asian countries. Future studies are awaited to update our finding in Asian population. Due to the limited available studies and data, we did not subgroup the patients based on migraine with or without aura. Besides, in our analysis we only evaluated middle-age migraine patients with or with aura, limiting our results to be applied for children with migraine and other types of migraine, such as chronic migraine. Whether the expression of BDNF rs6265 and rs2049046 polymorphism has any difference in different migraine types remains to unclear. In our analysis, we did not obtain raw SNPs data of each study. It limited our further exploration of the combined effect of this two SNPs, which required further study.<SEP>So far, several Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been perform to evaluate the susceptibility loci of migraine. However, the polymorphism of BDNF gene did not reach the significance in them. This difference didn’t indicate the impact of BDNF gene polymorphism was negligible. It may due to the large penalties on significance thresholds in GWAS model (p of association ≤ 10−7), leading to the lack of statistical power of BDNF gene. As a candidate-gene association study, our hypothesis arose from the positive association between BDNF and migraine revealed in previous clinical researches. This connection strengthened the reliability of our results. Up to now, with large sample sizes used to analysis, only a small number of susceptible genes has been found to be associated with migraine. Thus candidate-gene association study is still an effective and direct way to illustrate the association between gene and disease.",14043,['FOODIN']
31577850,"Introduction<SEP>TNF‐α blockers are efficaciously utilized in the treatment of various immune‐mediated diseases, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and, more recently, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 1, 2. However, cutaneous reactions, such as eczematous and psoriasiform lesions, and other side effects have been reported 3, 4, 5. Some of these adverse reactions are considered as paradoxical effects and, in particular, 2–5% of patients treated with TNF‐α antagonists develop paradoxical psoriasiform skin lesions 6, 7, 8, 9. These reactions may require the interruption of the imputable drug, and no other biologics are approved for diseases like in HS. Therefore, it is important to understand the pathogenesis of these reactions, and a possible genetic susceptibility should be examined in these patients.<SEP>Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease mediated by autoreactive T cells, which produces epidermal keratinocyte hyperproliferation with aberrant differentiation and senescence 10, 11. Early upstream events occurring in psoriasis include induction of innate immunity responses, primarily depending on keratinocytes activated by mechanical trauma, pathogens or drugs. At this initial phase, keratinocytes establish innate immunity circuits involving neutrophils, mast cells and macrophages and, importantly, enable plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)‐ and myeloid DC (mDC)‐driven responses 12, 13, 14. Local production of type I IFN, as well as TNF‐α and IL‐6, by pDC and mDC unleashes adaptive immune responses, with expansion of T lymphocytes, typically Th17 and Th22 in the initial phase and Th1 cells during the chronic phase of the disease 10, 11, 15. Hence, lymphokines released in skin lesions, in particular IL‐17, IL‐22, and IFN‐γ, further amplify local immune responses 10, 16, 17, 18. Chronic immune responses are absent in paradoxical psoriasis induced by TNF‐α blockers, with innate inflammatory processes predominant and not followed by expansion of autoreactive T cells 19. These processes are concomitant with dermal accumulation of immature pDC and type I IFN overexpression 19.<SEP>Several studies have shown that intrinsic defects in genes controlling T‐cell commitment and keratinocyte inflammatory activation are associated with psoriasis 20, 21. Among them, the HLA‐Cw6 allele represents the strongest genetic risk variant associated with psoriasis 22. The HLA‐Cw6 haplotype might influence antigen presentation and immune responses, especially when associated with variants in the ERAP1 gene, encoding an aminopeptidase involved in the formation of the peptides loaded on MHC class I molecules 23. Interestingly, a number of allelic variants were found in genes encoding signal transducers associated with IL‐17 or TNF‐α, such as NFKBIZ and TNFAIP3, encoding IKBζ and A20 proteins, respectively 24. Both IKBζ and A20 proteins regulate IL‐17‐ and TNF‐α‐induced molecular signaling, being an activator and a negative regulator of NF‐κΒ respectively 25.<SEP>Here, we report the immunological and genetic profiles of HS patients who developed psoriasiform reactions following anti‐TNF‐α therapy with adalimumab. We found that paradoxical psoriasiform skin predominantly shows immunological features common to early psoriasis, characterized by a massive infiltrate of innate immunity cells and local overproduction of innate immunity molecules. In contrast to classical psoriasis, psoriasiform lesions showed an increased number of infiltrating IL‐22+ leukocytes. Finally, we found that all the HS patients with paradoxical reactions carried allelic variants in genes predisposing to classical psoriasis, including SNPs in the HLA‐C genomic region.","Material and methods<SEP>Patients and samples<SEP>Three patients affected by HS, who developed psoriasiform skin lesions after treatment with adalimumab (40 mg, weekly), and three patients affected by classical plaque‐type psoriasis (PASI 8, 11.5, and 10) were included in the study. Clinical data, as well as skin biopsies and blood, were collected from patients with the permission of the IDI‐IRCCS Local Ethics Committee (Prot. CE 475/2016).<SEP>8‐mm skin biopsies were taken from psoriasiform lesions arising in HS patients or from 1.5‐month old psoriatic plaques. Biopsies were divided into two parts for immunohistochemistry and isolation of skin‐infiltrating T lymphocytes. A 2‐ml sample of peripheral blood was used to extract DNA, whereas a 20‐ml sample was used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).<SEP>Immunohistochemistry<SEP>5‐μm paraffin‐embedded skin sections were stained with H&E or processed for immunohistochemistry. The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti‐BDCA2 (DDX0043‐TDS, Dendritics, Lyon, France), anti‐CD15 (#347420, BD Biosciences, Milan, Italy), anti‐IL‐17A (#AF‐317‐NA, R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), anti‐lymphotoxin (LT)‐α (#SC8302, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti‐IL‐22 (#NB100‐733, Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA), anti‐IFN‐κ (#H00056832‐M01, Abnova, Taiwan), anti‐CD117 and anti‐CD11C (#MONX10234 and #MON3371, Monosan, Uden, Netherlands), anti‐CD68 and anti‐CD3 (#P02246IT and #A0452, Dako, Glostruk, Denmark). The following antibodies came from Abcam (Cambridge, UK): anti‐IFN‐γ (#AB218426), anti‐IL‐36γ (#AB156783), anti‐IFN‐β1 (#AB180616), and anti‐LT‐β (Cat#AB64835). Immunoreactivities were developed using the 3,3′‐diaminobenzidine HRP substrate. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin.<SEP>T‐cell isolation from skin biopsies and FACS analysis<SEP>T lymphocytes were isolated from skin biopsies as previously described 26. After 4–7 days, cells that had emigrated from biopsies were collected and characterized phenotypically. Lymphocytes were stained with the following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): anti‐IFN‐γ‐FITC (#B27), ‐CD4‐PE (#RPA‐T4), ‐CD8‐PeRcP (#SK1), ‐CD3‐FITC (#HIT3a) (BD Biosciences); anti‐TNF‐α‐FITC (#6n1E7, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch, Germany), ‐IL‐17‐PE (#eBio64DEC17, EBiosciences, Frankfurt, Germany); anti‐IL‐22‐PeRcP (#142928, R&D Systems).

The primer sets were as follows:Samples were analyzed using the QuantStudio5 Real‐Time PCR System (Thermo‐Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).<SEP>SNP analysis<SEP>DNA was extracted from blood using the QIAcube® system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). SNPs were selected based on an extensive review of articles on the association between psoriasis and SNPs or response to biologics 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. The SNP panel was analyzed by targeted sequencing, using NGS TruSeq Custom Amplicon kit and the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). SNPs are listed in supplementary material, Table S1 together with additional SNPs near the investigated genomic regions. Positive calls were selected applying a read depth >50X and allelic frequency >0.3. Variants' annotations were verified with ANNOVAR on hg19.<SEP>Statistics<SEP>Wilcoxon's signed rank test (SigmaStat; San Rafael, CA, USA) was used to compare differences in mRNA content in skin biopsies of HS and psoriatic patients. The significance of differences in the numbers of immunoreactive cells in skin biopsies was calculated using the unpaired Student's t‐test. Statistical analysis was performed with Prism v.5.0 (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA, USA), and values are expressed as the mean + SD. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.","Results<SEP>Clinical characterization of paradoxical psoriasis<SEP>We analyzed three patients affected by severe HS, and who developed paradoxical psoriasiform reactions following treatment with adalimumab. Patient 1, a 48‐year‐old Caucasian woman, showed nodules, fistulas and sinus tracts in the inguinal and perianal regions (Hurley III, Sartorius score: 41.5). After 3 months of therapy with anti‐TNF‐α, she developed psoriasiform eruptions (PASI 6.8), with pustular lesions and erythemato‐scaly lesions on the plantar region and lower limbs, respectively (Figure 1). A similar pattern of HS severity was observed in patient 2 (Hurley III, Sartorius score: 41.5), a 40‐year‐old Caucasian man, showing erythematous‐pustular lesions in the palmo‐plantar regions and erythemato‐scaly plaques on the legs and scalp, ascribed to psoriasiform dermatitis (PASI 5.2), arising after 2 months treatment with adalimumab (Figure 1). He concomitantly showed alopecia areata on the scalp and some eczematous‐like skin lesions. Patient 3, a 27‐year‐old Caucasian man, was affected by severe HS (Hurley III, Sartorius score: 61.5) characterized by comedones, nodules, and fistulas in the inguinal, gluteal and abdominal regions. He developed pustular lesions in the palmo‐plantar regions, and erythemato‐scaly plaques on the legs, scalp, elbows, and trunk (PASI 5.6) after 3 months of biological therapy (Figure 1). He refused to undergo a punch biopsy and, therefore, we could not perform the histological and immunological analyses. Paradoxical psoriasis regressed in all patients when adalimumab was discontinued. Interestingly, all three patients examined had a positive family history for psoriasis and, additionally, patient 1 reported other cases of HS among first‐degree relatives.<SEP>Histological examination of the psoriasiform lesions of patients 1 and 2 showed epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, papillary vessel ectasia and perivascular infiltrate compatible with a psoriasiform dermatitis (Figure 1). A CD15+ neutrophilic infiltrate was abundant in the dermal compartment and present in corneal abscesses (Figures 1 and 2). Interestingly, some eczematiform spongiotic areas overlapping with the psoriasis‐like histological pattern were present in the skin lesions of patient 2.<SEP>Innate immunity cells highly infiltrate paradoxical psoriasiform lesions<SEP>Leukocyte subpopulations were characterized in paradoxical psoriasiform lesions, and compared to those present in classical plaque‐type psoriasis. In line with previous studies 19, 33, paradoxical psoriasis exhibited a prominent infiltrate of BDCA2+ pDCs in the dermis, significantly more abundant than in classical psoriasis (~2.7‐fold increase). In parallel, a significant increase of CD15+ neutrophils, c‐kit/CD117+ mast cells, CD68+ macrophages and monocytes in the dermis of paradoxical skin reactions was observed (~3.8‐, 3.5‐, and 1.8‐fold increase, respectively) (Figure 2). In contrast, CD3+ cells were similar and CD11c+ DCs were less abundant (~1.5 fold‐decrease) (Figure 2).<SEP>We next evaluated the local expression of psoriasis‐related cytokines, such as IL‐17A, IFN‐γ, and IL‐22, as well as IL‐36γ which is highly released by neutrophils 27. As shown in Figure 3, IFN‐γ immunoreactivity decreased in psoriasiform reactions of patients 1 and 2, as compared to classical psoriasis, whereas IL‐22 positivity was significantly augmented in the infiltrate, in particular in cells with a macrophage‐like morphology (~2.1‐fold increase). Due to the numerous neutrophils present in the dermis of paradoxical reactions, IL‐36γ positivity was also enhanced, compared to classical psoriasis. However, IL‐36γ expression in the epidermal compartment was similar (Figure 3). FACS analysis of the T‐cells isolated from skin biopsies confirmed a significant reduction of IFN‐γ+ CD3+ cells in patients 1 and 2, when compared to CD3+ cells isolated from classical psoriasis (~7‐ and 1.7‐fold decrease, respectively) (Figure 4). The reduction of IFN‐γ positivity was also observed in circulating CD3+ cells of patients 1 and 2. Similarly, TNF‐α positivity was lower in skin T‐lymphocytes of patients 1 and 2. TNF‐α positivity of circulating CD3+ cells was instead lower only in patient 1, as compared to patient 2 and patients with classical psoriasis (Figure 4). Moreover, IL‐17A positivity was comparable in patient 1 and psoriatic patients, whereas it was very high in T cells isolated from the skin of patient 2, where a mixed population of T cells, responsible for either the psoriasiform or eczematous reactions, is likely present (Figure 1). IL‐22 was similar in T cells of psoriasiform lesions and classical psoriasis, whereas it was substantially reduced in PBMCs (Figure 4). CD3+ cells from skin biopsies of HS patients were enriched in CD8+, but not in CD4+ cells, when compared to PBMC isolated from the same patients. CD3+ skin T cells of classical psoriasis showed instead an enrichment of both CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations (Figure 4).<SEP>Overexpression of innate immunity molecules in paradoxical psoriasis<SEP>Since we found that the inflammatory infiltrate pattern in paradoxical psoriasis strongly resembles that present in acute psoriasis, we next analyzed selected innate immunity molecules potentially involved in the triggering of psoriasis. As shown in Figure 5A, the type I IFN‐β was expressed in paradoxical skin lesions, mainly in keratinocytes, at levels significantly higher than classical psoriasis (~1.9‐fold increase). IFN‐β expression was also detected in cells with a T‐cell‐ and DC‐like morphology, as well as in endothelial cells. The epidermis of psoriasiform reactions was also immunoreactive for IFN‐κ, another keratinocyte‐derived type I IFN 34. IFN‐κ expression was similar in the two psoriasis conditions, even if it showed different subcellular localization within keratinocytes, being cytoplasmic in psoriasiform lesions and membrane‐bound in classical psoriasis (Figure 5A). IFN‐κ staining was also present in cells with a monocyte‐ or DC‐like morphology, at comparable levels in classical and nonclassical psoriasis (Figure 5A). Similarly to IFN‐β, IFN‐α2a and IFN‐λ1, but not IFN‐λ2 and IFN‐λ3, were greatly increased in paradoxical psoriasis, as compared to plaque psoriasis (Figure 5B and data not shown). Of note, LL‐37 was strongly expressed in psoriasiform skin lesions, at levels higher than classical psoriasis (Figure 5B). We finally investigated LT‐α and LT‐β, two members of the cytokine TNF family, also known as TNF‐β and TNF‐C 35, possibly deregulated by anti‐TNF‐α therapy. Both lymphotoxins were strongly overexpressed in paradoxical skin reactions, especially in keratinocytes of the basal layer epidermis.<SEP>As a whole, these data reveal the presence of an overexpressed innate immunity pattern in the skin of HS patients with paradoxical psoriasis.<SEP>SNP characterization in HS patients developing paradoxical psoriasis<SEP>In order to understand whether paradoxical reactions of HS patients had a genetic basis, we analyzed a number of SNPs predisposing to psoriasis. Among them, we studied SNPs frequent in the psoriatic population, such as polymorphisms of the HLA‐C and HLA‐B regions and the ERAP1 gene. We also analyzed genetic variants of pathogenic cytokines, receptors and signal transducers (i.e. TNF‐α, IL‐17F, IL‐17RA, IL‐23R, IL‐12B, IKBζ, A20, A20 binding protein, Tyk2), and of skin‐barrier proteins (i.e. CDSN, CCHCR1) (see supplementary material, Table S1). All HS patients showed variants of ERAP1 and the HLA‐C region, either homozygosis or heterozygosis (Table 1). Three SNPs in ERAP1 (rs30187/rs30186/rs26653) and nine variants in HLA‐C (rs114395371/rs9264942/rs10484554/rs2524095/rs28383849/rs9264944/rs2853922/rs147538049/rs9264946) were, in fact, found in all patients, with SNPs distributed differently in the three patients. None of them showed the classical HLA‐Cw6 allele, even though patients 1 and 3 carried three point SNPs (rs2524095/rs2853922/rs386698994) mapping near the HLA‐Cw6 SNP position (rs17192540) (Table 1). In contrast, patient 2 mostly showed genetic polymorphisms (rs9264942/rs10484554/rs28383849/rs9264944/rs147538049/rs9264946) present in the genomic region containing a second variant of HLA‐Cw6 (Table 1). All HS patients carried SNPs in NFKBIZ (rs3217713) and TNFAIP (rs610604) genes, encoding IKBζ and A20 proteins respectively. Interestingly, patient 3 showed the higher number of psoriasis‐related SNPs, and shared a number of SNPs with patient 2 (rs7637230/rs4819554/rs3132554/rs10542126/rs3130983), and rs280519 with patient 1 (Table 1). Patient 3 also carried two other SNPs in CDSN (rs1062470/rs707913) and three SNPs in CCHCR1 (rs1576/rs130079/rs746647) (Table 1).<SEP>Although rs11209026 in the IL23R gene has been previously associated with paradoxical psoriasiform reactions to anti‐TNFs 36, we could not find this SNP in any of the HS patients. Two other SNPs in IL23R, rs72676067, and rs1004819, were instead detected in patients 2 and 1, respectively.","Discussion<SEP>Psoriasis pathogenesis involves both innate and adaptive immunity responses, overactive in different clinical phases and characterized by specific patterns of inflammation. While innate immunity processes predominate in early/acute phase, with immune cells such as pDC, neutrophils, mast cells and macrophages being abundant in skin lesions, adaptive immune responses are typical of chronic psoriasis 10, 14, 15, 37. Local overproduction of IFN‐α and other innate immune mediators, such as antimicrobial peptides, also characterize early psoriasis 37, 38. Conversely, during the development of chronicity, type I IFNs are no longer produced, in part due to the inhibitory effects of TNF‐α, which determines the decline of innate immunity processes and the mounting of adaptive immune responses 39. During this phase, TNF‐α is important for immune activation of mDC, which, after encountering the causative antigen(s), are responsible for T‐cell expansion.<SEP>In this study, we found that paradoxical psoriasis evoked by anti‐TNF‐α therapy in patients affected by HS strongly resembles early psoriasis. In fact, by comparing skin lesions of paradoxical psoriasis with classical psoriasis, we observed a marked dermal accumulation of innate immunity cells, including pDCs, neutrophils, mast cells, and macrophages. In parallel, the expression levels of innate immunity molecules potentially involved in induction of the psoriasiform phenotype, greatly increased in paradoxical reactions. Among them, IFN‐α2a, IFN‐β, and IFN‐λ1 are overexpressed in the skin of HS patients following anti‐TNF‐α therapy. Also, LT‐α and LT‐β, as well as LL‐37, were detected at very high levels in paradoxical psoriasis, when compared to classical psoriasis. A transient IFN‐α upregulation has already been described in classical psoriasis, during the early phase of disease development, as well as in paradoxical psoriasis 19, 37. Concomitantly, IFN‐β is known to be expressed by pDCs in both conditions 19. We found that IFN‐β, together with IFN‐κ and lymphotoxins were impressively expressed in the epidermal compartment of paradoxical skin reaction, as well as in pDCs and leukocytes infiltrating the dermis. Type I IFNs and lymphotoxins released by keratinocytes might have a fundamental pathogenic role in paradoxical psoriasis. However, the mechanisms by which these molecules promote a psoriatic skin phenotype are not yet known, neither in paradoxical nor in classical psoriasis. On the contrary, the immunological function of IFN‐α has been extensively studied, especially in classical psoriasis, where it is known to induce Th17 responses 40. In paradoxical psoriasis, IFN‐α could have a different role, with antigen‐specific Th17 responses being absent. It could induce chemokines at the epidermal level, such as CXCL10 and CXCL9, responsible for the recruitment of DC and nonspecific T cells. These inflammatory cells could in turn sustain and amplify local inflammatory responses in paradoxical reactions 41.<SEP>The induction of innate immunity players in paradoxical psoriasis is dependent on the loss of TNF‐α function in limiting the innate immune responses in the skin, as previously demonstrated 19. In fact, TNF‐α blockade determined the accumulation of pDCs and inhibition of their maturation. As a consequence, pDCs could release very high levels of the type I IFN‐α6 and IFN‐β, being, thus, responsible for paradoxical psoriasis. Together with pDCs, we found other innate immunity cells present in psoriasiform lesions of HS patients. Among them, CD15+ neutrophils, c‐kit/CD117+ mast cells, CD68+ macrophages and monocytes abundantly infiltrate the dermis of paradoxical skin reactions. This pattern of leukocyte subpopulations is very similar to that found in early psoriasis, and is consistent with the high local production of IL‐36 cytokines and with the overactive innate immunity processes present during the initial phase of psoriasis, as previously shown 14, 27. Conversely, similarly to paradoxical psoriasis, adverse HS in patients affected by autoimmune disorders, including psoriasis and Crohn's disease, might be dependent on aberrant innate immunity responses evoked by TNF‐α blockade 42, 43. Indeed, a number of pathogenic cytokines common to psoriasis were found in HS skin, including IL‐36, together with inflammatory mediators active on neutrophils and Th17 cells largely present in the affected areas 27. Other than pDCs, innate immune cells could also be recruited by chemokines released by keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells (i.e. CCL20, chemerin), whose expression depends on type I IFNs produced by resident skin cells themselves. In fact, other than controlling the expression of type I IFNs in pDCs, TNF‐α might negatively regulate these molecules in keratinocytes, which notoriously also contribute to the induction of innate immunity pathways in early psoriasis 10. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that type I IFNs are induced in keratinocytes of paradoxical psoriasis and vice versa are present at low levels in chronic plaque psoriasis. It would be important to confirm the high expression of innate immunity mediators following TNF‐α blockade in vitro in primary keratinocyte cultures, as demonstrated for cultured pDCs. It would be also relevant to analyze whether, similarly to paradoxical psoriasis, acute psoriasis shows exaggerated expression of type I IFNs and lymphotoxins in the epidermal compartment. In that case, it can be supposed that TNF‐α temporally limits innate immunity processes evoked not only by pDCs but also by keratinocytes to unleash adaptive immune responses in psoriatic skin.<SEP>Concerning the unknown expression and role of lymphotoxins in paradoxical reactions and in classical psoriasis, a previous study confirmed the pivotal function of LT‐α, together with TNF‐α, in determining NF‐κB‐mediated skin inflammatory reactions in IκBα−/− mice 44. In addition, patients affected by psoriatic arthritis treated with etanercept showed increased serum levels of LT‐α 45. Therefore, lymphotoxins might be deeply involved in psoriasis pathogenesis, and TNF‐α could tightly control their expression in both keratinocytes and lymphocytes. Further studies are needed to evaluate LT‐α and LT‐β expression and their role in the different phases of psoriasis development, and to understand the function of keratinocyte‐derived lymphotoxins.<SEP>Analysis of the T‐cell infiltrate in paradoxical skin reactions demonstrated a significant reduction of IFN‐γ‐ or TNF‐α‐producing CD3+ cells in paradoxical psoriasis, when compared to chronic psoriasis. However, CD8+ and IL‐17+ lymphocytes were present in paradoxical psoriasiform reactions, at levels comparable to psoriasis, even if it is conceivable that they were nonspecifically recruited. The absence of bursting of a type I IFN T‐cell response in paradoxical skin reactions was not surprising, if we consider that it is typical of the chronic phase in classical psoriasis 10, 11, 15. On the contrary, IL‐22‐producing cells increased in psoriasiform reactions of HS patients, even though positive cells showed mostly a macrophage‐like morphology. Our findings extend previous studies showing the upregulation of IL‐22 mRNA expression in paradoxical psoriasis, and identifying innate immunity cells, and not only T lymphocytes, as cellular sources of IL‐22 19. IL‐22 overexpression could be responsible for hyperproliferation and de‐differentiation of keratinocytes typical of the epidermis of paradoxical psoriasiform lesions. Finally, although an inflammatory cytokine milieu, inducing the local production of chemokines and cytokines by resident skin cells, can be effectively established in paradoxical psoriasis, it seems to be insufficient to induce the development of chronic psoriasiform reactions in HS patients, possibly through the lack of mDC and T‐cell activation by the causative antigen(s) of psoriasis.<SEP>Despite the effective use of adalimumab in patients with severe HS, 2–5% of treated patients develop paradoxical psoriasis 6. Anti‐TNF‐α treatment can induce paradoxical psoriasis even in patients affected by other diseases characterized by high levels of TNF‐α 8, 46, 47. Notably, this side effect can also occur in patients undergoing psoriasis treatment with anti‐TNFs. Guttate or pustular forms in palmo‐plantar/scalp areas frequently represent the subclinical types of psoriasis that develop in these reactive patients. The reason why anti‐TNF induces a similar psoriatic phenotype (same subtype and localizations) only in a portion of subjects affected by different autoimmune conditions is still unknown. It is reasonable to speculate the influence of genetic factors predisposing to paradoxical psoriasis, and specifically being involved in innate immunity pathways, in particular in pDC activation and/or type I IFN and TNF‐α signaling. Indeed, an association between polymorphisms in the IL‐23R, FBXL19, CTLA4, SLC12A8, and TAP1 genes and paradoxical psoriasis has been found 36. On the other hand, there is a positive association between HS and psoriasis, with the prevalence of HS increased in patients with psoriasis, suggesting a common genetic predisposition 48. To date, no evidence correlating the presence of SNPs and the development of psoriasiform lesions in patients affected by HS exist. In our study, we found that all HS patients carried numerous allelic variants in HLA‐C. None of the patients showed the HLA‐Cw6 susceptibility allele, even though other SNPs in the proximity of the HLA‐Cw6 SNP and neighboring to other HLA‐C variants were found. Concomitantly, HS patients carried allelic variants in the ERAP1 gene. However, due to the lack of antigen‐specific CD8+ T‐cell responses in HS patients, the link between the presence of SNPs in the HLA‐C region/ERAP1 gene and susceptibility to paradoxical psoriasis is apparently missing. Indeed, other than having a role in MHC class I antigen presentation, ERAP1 is involved in the activation of innate immunity pathways, by inducing the inflammasome and production of cytokines and chemokines (i.e. IL‐6, TNF‐α, and CCL2) 49. Importantly, allelic variants of ERAP1 leading to missense mutation increase the capability of ERAP1 to induce inflammation in autoimmune diseases 50. HS patients also carried polymorphisms in NFKBIZ and TNFAIP3, which could be responsible for NF‐κB hyperactivation in HS patients, as demonstrated for other pathological conditions 51, 52. Importantly, allelic variants in NFKBIZ and TNFAIP3 might determine the enhanced type I IFN expression observed in pDCs and keratinocytes of paradoxical lesions, as both IKBζ and A20 can transcriptionally regulate IFN expression, respectively, via activation and inhibition of NF‐κB 53. Finally, genetic variants in TNFAIP3, in particular those imparting lower A20 expression, might be responsible for uncontrolled IFN‐β expression, as demonstrated by silencing TNFAIP3 mRNA expression in a vascular model of inflammation 54. All these SNPs in psoriasis susceptibility loci are likely genetically transmitted, as all three patients examined had a positive family history for psoriasis. In the future, it will be necessary to extend the analysis of psoriasis‐related SNPs to a larger cohort of HS patients developing psoriasiform reactions, but also in a population successfully responding to anti‐TNF‐α treatment, to identify differences in the genetic background of the patients. The identification of genetic biomarkers correlating with an adverse response to anti‐TNF‐α therapy will be fundamental to predict the risk of developing paradoxical psoriasis.<SEP>In conclusion, our study shows that paradoxical psoriasis induced by anti‐TNF in patients affected by HS has immunological features common to early phase psoriasis, mainly characterized by cellular and molecular players of innate immunity. Among them, LT‐α and LT‐β, as well as IFN‐κ and IFN‐λ1, have been identified as new innate mediators potentially involved in the induction of paradoxical psoriasis. Of note, we found that, in addition to pDCs, keratinocytes are also a source of type I IFNs, in particular IFN‐β, likely as consequence of TNF‐α inhibition. It will be important to evaluate the effects of anti‐TNF‐α therapy on keratinocytes in paradoxical psoriasiform reactions, especially in terms of type I IFN production, to identify new pathogenic mechanisms involved in the early phase of psoriasis.",29677,"['FOODIN', 'FOODAL']"
21775430,"Introduction<SEP>Fanconi anemia (FA)4 is an X-linked or autosomal recessive disorder with a range of clinical presentations including bone marrow failure and high incidence of cancer. Mutations in one of at least 14 genes associated with FA lead to dysfunction in DNA interstrand cross-link repair, rendering patients susceptible to DNA-damaging agents. Of the FA genes, eight of the gene products form the FA core complex (FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L, and -M). The role of the complex, in conjunction with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) enzyme Ube2T, is to monoubiquitinate each of the components of the FANCI-FANCD2 (ID) complex. Mutation in any of the genes coding for the core complex results in the loss of this monoubiquitination event. The FA pathway is at least partially present in all eukaryal organisms, with yeast having only a FANCM homologue but all higher organisms possessing at least FANCD2. However, in the case of the core complex, vertebrates have the full complement, conserved from zebrafish to humans, whereas the invertebrates vary in their FA composition; Caenorhabditis elegans have no obvious core complex and the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum has a FANCE homologue, whereas Drosophila melanogaster has FANCM and FANCL homologues.<SEP>FANCL is the E3 ubiquitin ligase of the core complex. It was originally predicted from primary sequence to be a WD40-propeller fold, with a RING domain at the C terminus. A recent study also suggested the presence in human FANCL of an N-terminal RWD domain. The RWD classification is a submember of the UBC superfamily. The UBC superfamily has a core four-stranded β-meander, flanked by an N-terminal helix and one or two C-terminal helices. In the catalytic E2s, this meander has a C-terminal β-flap containing the catalytic cysteine (Fig. 1A). Most E2 folds contain a YPXXXP motif between strands 3 and 4 that forms a triple turn motif also predicted to be characteristic of the RWD-like fold. In the RWD fold, the β-flap assumes a helical conformation (Fig. 1A).<SEP>We recently reported the structure of full-length FANCL from D. melanogaster. DmFANCL comprises three domains, an N-terminal E2-like fold (ELF), a double RWD (DRWD) domain, and a C-terminal RING domain. The DmFANCL DRWD domain harbors no YPXXXP motifs, yet each lobe contains a helix in place of the β-flap, giving rise to the DRWD terminology.<SEP>Conservation in the core between the Drosophila and the vertebrate FANCLs suggests that they would be broadly similar in structure. However, the sequence identity between human and DmFANCL is low, at 21%. Of the three domains, the DRWD domain, particularly the N-terminal half, has the least sequence identity, at 9%. Given that the requirements for a core complex are apparently different between species and that in humans, the loss of any member of the complex results in failure to ubiquitinate the FANCI-FANCD2 complex, we set out to solve the structure of the human FANCL protein. We report here the structure of the central domain of human FANCL, representing ∼50% of the protein. We show that it is globally similar to the DmDRWD domain but that there are macromolecular differences between the proteins that may account for the biological differences in the systems. In addition, we demonstrate that the central human FANCL domain is dispensable for interaction with Ube2T but is essential to bind substrates FANCD2 and FANCI.","EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES<SEP>Protein Expression and Purification<SEP>Previous efforts to structurally characterize human FANCL had proved unsuccessful, but the understanding of the domain architecture of DmFANCL allowed us to design new constructs. We synthesized a codon-optimized version of the human FANCL coding sequence, using GeneArt. We then subcloned the central domain (residues 109–294) and the RING domain (residues 289–375) into a vector containing an N-terminal His-Smt3 tag using restriction-free cloning. Human Ube2T cDNA was purchased as an I.M.A.G.E. clone (Geneservice) and cloned into the same vector as described above. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Invitrogen) in lysogeny broth medium supplemented with antibiotics and with 0.5 mm ZnCl2 in the case of the RING domain. Cells were cultured at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 nm, induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the case of Ube2T), and cultured overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication on ice (10-s bursts followed by 30 s on ice, repeated four times) in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 250 μm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (10 μm ZnCl2 added when purifying the RING domain). Sonicated samples were subjected high-speed centrifugation at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Clarified supernatants were applied to an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Invitrogen) equilibrated with sonication buffer. Fusion proteins were cleaved overnight at 4 °C with Smt3 protease, Ulp1, at a w/w of 1:30 Ulp1:His-Smt3-protein. Flow-through was collected, concentrated, and applied to a Superdex 200 or Superdex 75 column for size-exclusion chromatography. Purified proteins were concentrated to 20 mg/ml (central domain), 8 mg/ml (RING), and 15 mg/ml (Ube2T), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Human central domain mutants were generated using the Stratagene site-directed mutagenesis method with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. The central domain mutants were prepped as the wild type (WT). Human His-FANCD2 was a kind gift from M. R. Hodskinson and K. J. Patel and prepared as described. Xenopus laevis FLAG-FANCI was a kind gift from P. Knipscheer and J. C. Walter and prepared as described.<SEP>Crystallization and Structure Determination<SEP>Human FANCL central domain crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C, in space group C2, with cell dimensions a = 147.6 Å, b = 102.5 Å, c = 65.8 Å, α = 90, β = 94.09, γ = 90. Solvent-content estimates suggested two monomers per asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 79%. Crystallization conditions were: 0.2 m l-proline, 0.1 m trisodium citrate, pH 5.5, 2% PEG 3350. Crystals were harvested and cryocooled after protection with 30% glycerol. Data were collected at the DIAMOND synchrotron light source beamline I03, at 0.98 Å wavelength. Both a low-resolution pass and a high-resolution pass were collected (3.5 and 1.75 Å, respectively). The two datasets were processed separately using Mosflm and then merged using XDS and scaled using XSCALE. The last 55 images from the high-resolution data set were omitted from data processing due to radiation damage to the crystal, which accounts for 75% completeness in the outer shell (2.05–2.0 Å, overall completeness 79%). The data were phased using the DmFANCL DRWD domain, residues 109–292, as a search model (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 3K1L), with the program PHASER. The model was rebuilt manually through iterative cycles of refinement using COOT for building and PHENIX for refinement. Omit maps were generated across regions of the protein to assess model bias. The structure was refined to 2.0 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules, A and B. A is complete and in a single conformation throughout and is used for the analyses reported. Copy B, however, has a region of disorder where residues Cys-174–Ser-182 in loop 6 appear in the electron density maps in multiple conformations. To reflect this movement/disorder, these atoms have been assigned varying occupancies in the PDB file as judged manually in the final 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc maps. Along with the high resolution of the data and the fact that chain B has crystal contacts, the non-crystallographic symmetry was not used for some of the loop regions (a total of 80 residues left out of the non-crystallographic symmetry). The final model possesses excellent stereochemistry with all residues in the favored regions of the Ramachandran diagram (98.7%) on the basis of an analysis with MolProbity. Table 1 summarizes the data collection and refinement statistics.<SEP>Structural Analyses<SEP>All structural analyses were carried out on Chain A of the model. Figures were produced using PyMOL, and structure-based alignments were produced using MegaAlign and manual adjustments. To produce the electrostatic surfaces, programs pdb2pqr and apbs were used in conjunction with PyMOL.<SEP>Thioester Charge Assay<SEP>2 μm E2, His-UbcH7 (Boston Biochem), or human central domain was charged with an excess (50 μm) of HA-Ub (Caltag Medsystems) using 150 nm E1 (Boston Biochem). A total reaction volume of 10 μl was made up with assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mm MgCl, and 5 mm ATP. Reactions were left for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were then terminated by the addition of 40 μl of 2× non-reducing SDS buffer. 20 μl of each reaction then had 1 μl of 1 m β-mercaptoethanol added to reduce the thioester bond. 4 μl of each sample was loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and visualized using Western blots. Antibodies used were anti-His (GE Healthcare), anti-HA, and anti-FANCL raised against recombinant human FANCL central domain (Pettingill Technology Ltd.).<SEP>In Vitro Pulldown Assays<SEP>In a total reaction volume of 1 ml containing assay buffer: 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, and 250 μm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine, human His-FANCD2 (225 nm) or X. laevis FLAG-FANCI (225 nm) was added with an excess of human FANCL central domain or mutants at 454 nm. Reactions were left to bind for 1 h at room temperature. 100 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) or 100 μl of anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma) was equilibrated in assay buffer, added to the 1-ml reaction, and left on a roller at 4 °C for at least 1 h. Samples were washed with 10 ml of assay buffer. Agarose/affinity gel was then resuspended in 100 μl of assay buffer, 50 μl of 2× SDS buffer was added, and the sample was boiled. 9 μl of the samples was loaded onto SDS page gel, subjected to Western blotting, and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Abcam.<SEP>Analytical Gel Filtration<SEP>Initial establishment of interactions between the human central domain (109–294), and human RING domain (289–375) with Ube2T was carried out by analytical gel filtration. Interaction buffer contained 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 μm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine, 10 μm ZnCl2 with 100 mm NaCl. An increased amount of NaCl to 500 mm was used for central domain interactions as the protein is unstable in lower amounts of NaCl. Samples were incubated on ice for 1 h with a total volume of 500 μl. Samples were then loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (equilibrated with the sample buffer), and 0.5-ml fractions were collected for analysis on 12% SDS-PAGE gels.<SEP>Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)<SEP>Kinetic information of Ube2T binding interactions with FANCL domains was established using the iTC200 microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Sample buffers were the same as interaction buffers used for analytical gel filtration. Experiments were carried out at 8 °C. The syringe contained Ube2T between 650 and 750 μm that injected a total volume of 40 μl by 2.5-μl injections. The cell contained a total volume of 205 μl of either RING (70 μm) or central domain (65 μm). Cell concentrations were adjusted for a 1:1 stoichiometric interaction, and MicroCal Origin software version 7.0 was used to determine dissociation constants (Kd). All measurements were repeated at least twice.","RESULTS<SEP>The Structure of Human FANCL Central Domain<SEP>We have determined the structure of the predicted human DRWD domain (residues 109–294) to 2.0 Å resolution. Overall, the human FANCL central domain has a fused bilobal shape with dimensions: 70 × 25 × 20 Å, consisting of four α-helices and nine β-strands (Fig. 2A). Each lobe contains a four-stranded β-meander followed by a β-element in the N-terminal lobe and an α-helix in the C-terminal lobe. The lobes are fused by a kinked helix that runs from one lobe to the other. In addition, there is an α-helix N-terminal to the first β-meander and a C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 2B).<SEP>Global Comparison with DmFANCL<SEP>A comparison of known structures using the DALI server unsurprisingly reveals DmFANCL (PDB code 3K1L) as the closest structural homologue. However, a DALI comparison using only the N-terminal lobe (residues 109–194) or C-terminal lobe (residues 195–294) of the human central domain lists E2 UBC enzymes as the most structurally similar for both, with significant RWD fold hits only for the C-terminal lobe (Fig. 2C). This is due to the single biggest difference between the DmDRWD and the human central domain being the change of secondary structure element in the N-terminal lobe (Fig. 2D). In the DmDRWD, both lobes contain a helix after the four-stranded β-meander, indicative of an RWD fold, even in the absence of the triple turn YPXXXP motif. The human central domain, however, harbors the YPXXXP motif in the N-terminal lobe and a related HPXXXP motif in the C-terminal lobe (Fig. 3A). However, the human N-terminal lobe has a β-element in the position normally occupied by a helix in RWD folds. This puts the N-terminal lobe of the human central domain in an almost intermediary position between an E2 fold with a β-flap in the catalytic position and an α-helix in the non-catalytic RWD-like folds (Fig. 2C). Therefore the human central domain is not a DRWD but in fact a UBC-RWD domain. For the remainder of this study, the human central FANCL domain will be referred to as the UBC-RWD domain (URD). Structure-based sequence alignment with other FANCL proteins reveals that this element swap is likely to be in all the vertebrate FANCLs (Fig. 3A). Therefore we refer to this as a vertebrate-specific feature, and it represents a key difference between the vertebrate and invertebrate FANCLs.<SEP>Intriguingly, the human β-element in the N-terminal lobe contains a cysteine (Fig. 3A). Superposition of the human N-terminal lobe with Ube2T, with a root mean square deviation of 2 Å, reveals that the cysteine in the URD β-element lies structurally in the same position as the catalytic cysteine of Ube2T (Fig. 2C). We wondered whether this cysteine was capable of forming a thioester bond with ubiquitin as in the case of the catalytic E2s. To test whether the cysteine in the URD is catalytic, we carried out a thioester charge assay. The thioester assay revealed that the URD is unable to form a thioester linkage between its cysteine and the activated C terminus of ubiquitin (Fig. 3B).<SEP>The interacting residues between the N- and C-terminal lobes of the URD and DmDRWD are not conserved (Fig. 3, A and C). However the residues that make up the hydrophobic core between the two lobes are highly conserved (Fig. 3A). A structural alignment of the human and Drosophila domains shows an overall conservation of 50%, with only 13% of residues absolutely conserved (Fig. 3A). There are also differences in conservation between the two lobes, with the C-terminal lobe being more conserved than the N-terminal lobe (30 and 20%, respectively).<SEP>Surface Composition Reveals Extensive Hydrophobic Exposure<SEP>It is likely that differences in a core complex requirement for the vertebrate system arise from the need to stabilize FANCL. We reasoned that there would likely be differences in the surface conservation and surface chemical composition between DmFANCL and human FANCL (HsFANCL). To assess this, we generated surface maps of the URD and compared it with the DmDRWD domain (Fig. 4).<SEP>The surface conservation between DmDRWD and the URD is ∼32%. The surface is more conserved on the C-terminal lobe at 20% as compared with the N-terminal lobe at 12% (Figs. 3A and 4A).<SEP>Comparison of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues between the URD and the DmDRWD reveals additional surface hydrophobic residues on the URD. A small hydrophobic patch resides on the N-terminal lobe of the URD, between the last β-strand of the four-stranded β-meander (β4) and the β-element (residues Leu-149, Tyr-165, Phe-166, and Val-167, Fig. 4B). Additionally a patch on the URD lies between α-helix 1 and the N-terminal region of the large kinked helix, corresponding to residues Leu-121, Ala-140, Ile-184, Tyr-187, and Leu-191 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, a reasonably conserved region resides on the N-terminal region corresponding to residues Tyr-112, Tyr-113, and Leu-116 in DmDRWD, and more extensively in humans, Ile-115, Trp-123, Leu-126, Val-127, Tyr-128, Ala-129, and Phe-133 (Fig. 4B). On the C-terminal domain of the DmDRWD is a hydrophobic groove between the last β-strand of the four-stranded β-meander and α-helix 3 that follows (residues Ile-243, Met-246, Leu-248, Leu-264, Leu-268, and Trp-271). In the human URD, there is also a hydrophobic groove formed by residues Phe-253, Val-260, and Leu-268, but it is extended by comparison with the DmFANCL to include Leu-248, Phe-252, Leu-254, Ile-265, and Ile-271 (Fig. 4B). In the URD, there is an additional small hydrophobic patch that consists of Trp-212, Val-213, and Leu-214. In Drosophila DRWD, the corresponding residues are His-208, Val-209, and Leu-210. This patch in the Drosophila DRWD is partly occluded by the DRWD-RING loop in the full-length FANCL structure.<SEP>A comparison of the electrostatic potential of the surfaces of the URD and the DmDRWD reveals distinct differences between the species (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, there is a large positive patch on the DmDRWD, which is absent in the URD. Overall, the URD has a greater negative charge then the DmDRWD, which wraps around the URD like a ring. However, on the backside of the central FANCL domain in both human and Drosophila, there is a similar overall negative charge.<SEP>The Human RING Domain Binds Ube2T<SEP>To assess whether the URD plays any role in Ube2T binding, we carried out size-exclusion chromatography and ITC. Initial results from the size-exclusion chromatography showed no change in migration that would correspond to a complex formation between the URD and Ube2T (Fig. 5A). To further assess the interaction, we employed ITC, which again showed no interaction between the URD and Ube2T (Fig. 5B). We then tested the purified RING domain to see whether it was sufficient for Ube2T binding. We initially observed a 1:1 stoichiometric interaction between the RING and Ube2T as judged by the migration of the complex during size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5A). To ascertain the affinity of RING for Ube2T, we carried out ITC. After titration of Ube2T into RING, the data were fitted with a stoichiometry of 1:1 as seen in the size-exclusion chromatography, resulting in an equilibrium binding dissociation constant (Kd) of 454 nm (Fig. 5B). Based on the structure of UbcH7 bound to the RING E3 c-cbl, we mutated Phe-63 in Ube2T, predicted to be interacting with the RING, to alanine. No complex shift was observed between Ube2T-F63A and RING using analytical gel filtration (Fig. 5A). Further analysis using ITC revealed that mutant Ube2T-F63A was able to bind the RING domain, but with an 11-fold decrease in binding affinity (Kd = 5 μm, Fig. 5B).<SEP>The Human Central Domain Binds FANCI and FANCD2<SEP>In the Drosophila system, pulldown studies indicated that the ELF domain was not required for substrate binding. Given the role of the RING domain in E2 binding, we hypothesized that the URD domain would be sufficient for substrate binding. To test this, we performed in vitro pulldown experiments with FANCI, FANCD2, and the URD (Fig. 6). As expected, the URD was pulled down by both substrates. Our structural analysis reveals several hydrophobic patches exposed on the surface of the URD (Fig. 4B). To establish which patch(es) may be required for substrate binding, we generated the following mutants: L149A/F166A; L248A/F252A/L254A/I265A; V127A/Y128A; and W212A/L214A (Fig. 6A). All mutants were purified to homogeneity as wild type URD and subjected to pulldown arrays with FANCI and FANCD2. Both substrates showed reduced binding with mutants L248A/F252A/L254A/I265A and W212A/L214A as compared with wild type, indicating that the exposed hydrophobic patches on the C-terminal lobe are required for substrate binding. In contrast, mutations in the patches on the N-terminal lobe behaved as wild type (Fig. 6B).","DISCUSSION<SEP>The structure of the human central FANCL domain (URD) adopts the same overall topology as the Drosophila DRWD domain, confirming that the FANCL proteins belong to the UBC and RING superfamilies and are not WD40 proteins as predicted. The human central domain does differ from the DmFANCL as it does not have a DRWD but contains a UBC fold fused to an RWD fold (URD). Gene duplication resulting in fused domains is not a novel occurrence in protein topology. However, the fused consecutive UBC superfamily folds, seen in both the URD and the DmDRWD, are unique and appear to be specific to FANCL.<SEP>In the context of the full-length human FANCL, there may be subtle differences in domain associations. Structure-based sequence alignments of vertebrate FANCL proteins to Drosophila FANCL reveal that the loops connecting ELF-URD (or ELF-DRWD) and URD-RING (or DRWD-RING) are divergent between species. The ELF-URD loop is conserved in length, but not composition, and in the Drosophila structure, there are no interactions between the ELF and any other part of the protein. One possible explanation for the existence of a β-element in place of the helix in human FANCL URD may be to allow a more intimate association between the URD and ELF domains. The URD-RING loop in human FANCL is 7 residues shorter than in DmFANCL. We show a high affinity of human RING for the E2, Ube2T, which may reflect a different arrangement of the URD and RING domains in the human protein. Further structural analyses of the relationship between the human URD and RING domains and other members of the FANCL family will be required to tease out these differences.<SEP>Although we have shown that the URD domain is not required for Ube2T binding, the URD domain appears to be essential for the function of FANCL. It has been previously shown in the Drosophila system that the ELF domain is not required to bind substrates FANCD2 and FANCI. In this analysis, we show that the human URD domain is sufficient for binding substrates. Additionally, we also reveal the molecular determinants of this binding (Fig. 6). In particular, the residues Trp-212, Leu-214, Leu-248, and Leu-254 are conserved across species (Fig. 3A). Previous mutational work based on the predicted structure of FANCL indicated that the then uncharacterized URD domain was essential for core complex assembly, with point mutants R226E, W201A, and W274A (human numbering, numbered as 275 in Ref.) abolishing core complex assembly. Our structure of human FANCL URD provides a molecular rationale for these observations and indicates that loss of core complex assembly is in fact due to structural instability (Fig. 7). As predicted from the Drosophila FANCL structure, Arg-226 forms buried salt bridges with Asp-208 and the main-chain oxygen of Ala-223 (Fig. 7). Mutation of this residue to the oppositely charged glutamate therefore destabilizes these salt bridges and consequently the surrounding fold. Trp-201 is right in the middle of the interface connecting the N- and C-lobes of the URD domain (Fig. 7). A W201A mutation would therefore impact the folding of the lobes as this residue is clearly seen in the structure to be stacking against and making multiple contacts with residues His-148, Arg-146, and Arg-221. Therefore, although the hydrophobic nature of the residue is maintained, the contacts in the core are not (Fig. 7). Finally, Trp-274 is completely conserved between all the FANCL species, including Drosophila. In our URD structure, Trp-274 forms a hydrogen bond between the side-chain nitrogen of the tryptophan and the main-chain oxygen of Thr-246. Mutation of this Trp-274 to alanine removes this hydrogen bond as well as multiple van der Waals contacts with residues Met-247 and Asn-283 (Fig. 7). We can conclude that these particular mutations destabilize the URD domain, and we can speculate, based on the extent of surface-exposed hydrophobic patches on the URD domain, that this domain is very likely to be involved in binding one or more of the core complex proteins. The presence of such patches certainly suggests a number of protein-protein interaction sites. Interestingly, a recent study implicates the URD domain in (PCNA) proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding, providing a potential link between the translesion synthesis and FA pathways. Coupled with our observation that the URD binds FANCI and FANCD2, it appears that the URD domain of FANCL is responsible for several interactions. Finally, there has been speculation that phosphorylation of FANCI, shown to trigger the FA pathway in the chicken system, may enhance the ability of FANCL to bind FANCI. For this to be the case, we would anticipate the existence of a basic patch on FANCL to mediate interaction with a cluster of negatively charged phosphate ions. From our surface electrostatic analysis of the URD domain, there is no such patch, yet intriguingly, there is in the Drosophila protein. Further structural studies of FANCL in complex with substrates and other binding partners will be required to determine the functions of these surfaces.<SEP>This work was supported by a grant from Cancer Research UK.<SEP>The atomic coordinates and structure factors (code 3ZQS) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (http://www.rcsb.org/).<SEP>FA<SEP>Fanconi anemia<SEP>DmFANCL<SEP>D. melanogaster FANCL<SEP>Ub<SEP>ubiquitin<SEP>UBC<SEP>ubiquitin-conjugating<SEP>URD<SEP>UBC-RWD domain<SEP>DRWD<SEP>double RWD<SEP>DmDRWD<SEP>D. melanogaster DRWD<SEP>ELF<SEP>E2-like fold<SEP>ITC<SEP>isothermal titration calorimetry<SEP>RWD<SEP>found in RING, WD-containing proteins, DEXD helicases.<SEP>The abbreviations used are: ",26250,['FOODIN']
22271411,"Background<SEP>A crucial mechanism in the control of bile acid (BA) homeostasis involves the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19)-mediated feedback inhibition of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the hepatic synthesis of BA from cholesterol. This negative feedback requires binding of the hormone FGF19 to the receptor fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), and its co-receptor klothoβ (KLB) on the hepatocytes plasma membrane. Walters et al. showed that patients with BA malabsorption (BAM) have low serum FGF-19 levels, suggesting that impaired FGF19-mediated negative feedback leads to excessive hepatic BA synthesis and secretion into the small intestine. Without increased ileal BA absorption through the apical sodium-dependent BA transporter (ASBT, also called ileal BA transporter or IBAT), this excess BA leaks into the colon, inducing colonic secretion and motility which manifest as diarrhea.<SEP>Bile acid malabsorption is observed in around 30% of chronic functional diarrhea that is otherwise unexplained. This is based on measurements such as 75SeHCAT retention as well as positive response to trials of BA binding therapy. When measurements of fecal BAs or 75SeHCAT retention are not available, an empiric trial with a BA binder such as cholestyramine is commonly used to “diagnose” BAM based on therapeutic response to therapy. In patients with clinically diagnosed diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), Odunsi-Shiyanbade et al. showed that the BA sequestrant, colesevelam, reduces colonic transit. The reduction in colonic transit by colesevelam is greatest in patients with high serum 7αC4, a surrogate marker of hepatic BA synthesis rate previously validated against the 75SeHCAT retention test.<SEP>We have previously demonstrated that genetic variants of KLB and FGFR4, whose protein products are critical to FGF19-mediated feedback inhibition of hepatic BA synthesis, significantly influence baseline colonic transit in IBS-D. We also observed that genetic variants in KLB and FGFR4 influence the acceleration of colonic transit by treatment with exogenous BA in IBS-C patients. In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that colesevelam’s slowing effects on colonic transit in IBS-D patients is influenced by genetic variants in KLB and FGFR4. In the present study, participants were not selected on the basis of evidence of BAM.","Methods<SEP>Study Design<SEP>We performed a pharmacogenetic analysis of data acquired in a previously published double-blind, randomized study of oral placebo versus colesevelam, 1.875 g, twice daily, taken for 12–14 consecutive days, in 24 female IBS-D patients (mean age 42.7 years). Patients met Rome II criteria for IBS.<SEP>Participants<SEP>The detailed information about these participants, recruitment and trial flow are described in the previous publication and summarized in Fig. 1.<SEP>Colonic Transit<SEP>Colonic transit was measured by a validated scintigraphic method using a delayed-release capsule to deliver 111In-charcoal particles to the ileocolonic region. The primary endpoints for CT were ascending colon emptying half-time (AC t1/2) and geometric center at 24 h (GC24), a validated measure of overall colonic transit.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>Genotyping was performed on five common, non-synonymous, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KLB (rs17618244 and rs497501) and FGFR4 (rs351855, rs386618, and rs1966265), as shown in Table 1. Minor allele frequencies were > 15% for all five SNPs. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples (usually drawn from a forearm vein) using standard methods; the blood draw was obtained at the screening visit, prior to any drug administration. TaqMan SNP assay was used for genotyping as previously described. A single subject in the colesevelam treatment group did not give a blood sample, so genotype data were not available for this subject.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>An analysis of covariance was used to test for differential treatment effects on CT by colesevelam across genotype groups using a dominant genetic model coding for genotype (homozygotes of major allele vs. heterozygotes plus homozygotes of minor allele). The ANCOVA models included terms for genotype (the covariate), treatment (colesevelam vs. placebo) and the “interaction term” of genotype by treatment. This latter term is used to test for differences in treatment effects depending on genotype. All reported P values are unadjusted for multiple genes assessed, or multiple specific pair-wise (treatment group) comparisons.","Results<SEP>Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was assessed in healthy control patients in a previous study (Table 1). HWE was satisfied in four of the five candidate SNPs in this study, with the exception of FGFR4 rs376618. However, there were no significant differential treatment effects associated with this SNP. The distribution of participants’ genotypes for the four other SNPs is shown in Table 2.<SEP>Effect of FGFR4 Genotype Variation<SEP>The functional genetic variant, FGFR4 rs351855 (Gly388Arg), was associated with differential colesevelam treatment effect on AC t1/2 (P = 0.046) and for GC24 (P = 0.073). In the rs351855 GA/AA genotype group, colesevelam significantly delayed CT, with increased AC t1/2 (23.46 ± 3.56 h vs. 9.95 ± 2.70 h on placebo, P = 0.04) and decreased GC24 (2.28 = 0.31 vs. 3.59 = 0.56 units on placebo, P = 0.05). In contrast, in the rs351855 GG genotype group, there was no significant effect of colesevelam treatment on CT with either AC t1/2 (13.38 ± 2.79 h vs. 18.50 ± 5.33 h on placebo, P = 0.43) or GC24 (3.49 ± 0.59 vs. 3.10 ± 0.40 units on placebo, P = 0.56, see Fig. 2). No significant differential colesevelam treatment effects were detected in the two other FGFR4 SNPs tested.<SEP>Effect of KLB Genotype Variation<SEP>There was a differential treatment effect on CT associated with KLB rs4975017 (P = 0.048). In the CA/AA genotype group, colesevelam treatment compared to placebo was associated with lower GC24 value (P = 0.042), and a numerically longer in AC t1/2 (P = 0.085) on colesevelam versus placebo (Fig. 3). No such significant treatment effects were observed in the group with CC genotype (P > 0.30 for both GC 24 and AC t1/2).<SEP>The functional variant KLB rs17618244 (Arg728Gln) was associated with numerical though not statistically significant differential colesevelam treatment effects on AC t1/2 and GC24. Modest treatment effects were observed in the GG genotype (P = 0.14 for AC t1/2, P = 0.12 for GC24), but not in the GA/AA genotype (P > 0.8, see Fig. 4).","Discussion<SEP>We have shown that the polymorphisms FGFR4 rs351855 and KLB rs4975017 may influence the colonic transit response to colesevelam in female patients with IBS-D. These data provide further evidence that genetic variations in the FGF19–FGFR4–KLB pathway that are critical for feedback inhibition of hepatic BA synthesis may affect colesevelam-mediated delay of colonic transit in IBS-D. These data also indirectly support the relevance of the FGF19–FGFR4–KLB pathway in the control of colonic transit.<SEP>We have investigated the association of genotype with potential differential treatment effects on colonic transit in patients with IBS, i.e. the impact of pharmacogenetics on the transit responses to treatment of IBS-C patients.<SEP>First, the GG genotype of KLB SNP rs17618244 is associated with accelerated colonic transit. FGFR4 SNPs appear to be functioning, since the FGFR4 SNPs modulate the actions of KLB. Thus, we showed KLB rs17618244, with either FGFR4 rs351855 or FGFR4 rs1966265, influenced colonic transit in IBS-D patients in the absence of any pharmacological therapy.<SEP>Second, in a separate pharmacogenomics study, we also showed that genetic variants in KLB and FGFR4 influence the degree of acceleration of colonic transit in IBS-C patients mediated by treatment with chenodeoxycholate (CDC), a primary bile salt. For example, in IBS-C patients, KLB rs17618244 GG genotype was associated with accelerated AC t1/2 with 500 and 1,000 mg CDC doses, whereas GA/AA genotype showed accelerated transit with 1,000 mg, but not with the 500 mg CDC.<SEP>The present study has shown that, in specific genetic subgroups, there is a very significant effect on colonic transit of colesevelam compared to placebo. This effect is manifest in the overall assessment of colonic transit with the geometric center measurement at 24 h, as well as with prolongation in the emptying time of the ascending colon, which would allow greater time for absorption of water in the proximal colon and change in stool frequency and consistency. We have previously demonstrated that a 1 geometric center unit difference at 24 h corresponds to a ~ 0.58 unit change in stool consistency as measured by the Bristol stool form scale and a change in stool frequency of 0.44/day. In addition, the magnitude of difference in AC t1/2 observed with colesevelam compared to placebo (difference in mean values ~ 13 h) is greater than the effect of alosetron (difference in mean values 5.2 h) in AC t1/2 in patients with IBS-D.<SEP>Our analysis of the genotype-intermediate phenotype association did not correct for the five tested gene variations and, therefore, the data are hypothesis-generating and require replication. Nevertheless, the results are quite remarkable, as they are based on a well-characterized intermediate phenotype (colonic transit measurement) and on a sample of only 12 patients treated with colesevelam and 12 treated with placebo. These data are also helpful, since they provide the basis for calculating the sample size required in future replication studies.<SEP>The three other SNPs were non-contributory in this association analysis of the effect of colesevelam on colonic transit. This may reflect the fact that FGFR4 rs351855 and KLB rs4975017 had the highest MAFs of 30–40% among the five SNPs studied, whereas the three other SNPs had MAF of only 18–23%. Thus, the lack of association with other SNPs may reflect a type II error. This is particularly relevant to the assessment of the association of KLB rs17618244 with the effects of colesevelam on colonic transit and AC emptying, as shown in Fig. 4. For KLB rs17618244, the distribution of genotype was ~ GG for each GA/AA, and the randomization yielded roughly balanced subgroups in each treatment. The difference (colesevelam vs. placebo) in GC24 values was essentially zero in the GA/AA genotype, while it was ~ 0.9 in the GG genotype. Thus, if the treatment effect in a future study were to replicate the mean data observed in the current study, that is, a differential treatment effect on colonic transit (GC24) of 0.1 in GA/AA group (e.g. 3.2 vs. 3.1), and 1.3 in the GG group (e.g. 3.3 vs. 2.0), 176 subjects would be needed to document a pharmacogenetic effect of this SNP on response to colesevelam with 80% power. Thus, while we cannot exclude a type II error in assessing the effects of the three non-significant SNPs, their impact seems unlikely to be clinically relevant.<SEP>Bile acid malabsorption is increasingly recognized as a cause of chronic, functional diarrhea which is otherwise unexplained. It is also considered that BAM contributes to diarrhea in patients with IBS-D, since there is significant overlap of symptoms of functional diarrhea and IBS-D, and BA binding with colesevelam retardation of colonic transit was significantly associated with BA synthesis, measured by the surrogate serum 7αC4. Given the claim that ~ 30% of patients with chronic functional diarrhea and ~ 20% of patients with IBS-D have evidence of BAM, it is clinically relevant to screen for BAM in patients with symptoms of functional diarrhea or IBS-D. For example, these prevalence rates are much higher than the estimated 0.4–4% of such patients who have celiac disease. Given the observations in our current study, we believe that, in addition to screening for BAM in patients presenting with IBS-D or functional diarrhea, it is appropriate to include a therapeutic trial of a BA-binding medication. Larger studies are needed to determine whether the genotype assay would help identify optimal responders to this form of therapy.<SEP>The current screening tests for BAM are measurement of fecal BAs and the 75SeHCAT retention test. Regrettably, fecal BA measurements are not widely available, and the 75SeHCAT retention test is not available in the United States as the isotope was never approved for clinical testing. Our data suggest that the FGFR4 rs351855 and KLB rs4975017 polymorphisms may facilitate identification of a subset of IBS-D patients with significant beneficial response to BA sequestration with colesevelam.<SEP>Conflict of interest The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.",12773,['FOODIN']
22610000,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel function that are unexplained by overt structural or tissue abnormalities. Diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) may have specific etiologies, including bile acid (BA) malabsorption (BAM). Colonic exposure to BA, as in idiopathic BAM, stimulates colonic motility and secretion and is associated with functional diarrhea and IBS-D. In a systematic review, BAM was reported in 32% of patients with unexplained chronic diarrhea; these patients’ diarrhea responds to BA sequestration therapy. The BA sequestrant, colesevelam, may lead to constipation in diabetic patients and delayed ascending colon emptying in patients with IBS-D with evidence of increased BA synthesis.<SEP>Hepatic BA synthesis is partly controlled by feedback inhibition by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19, a hormone secreted by ileal enterocytes into the portal circulation in response to high intracellular concentration of BA in ileal enterocytes. FGF19 binds to FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) and the coreceptor Klotho-β (KLB) on the hepatocyte cell membrane, leading to suppression of the rate-limiting enzyme in BA synthesis, cytochrome P450 7A1. Chronic diarrhea patients with idiopathic BAM may have reduced FGF19 secretion, leading to high hepatic BA synthesis and excessive BA entry into the colon and diarrhea.<SEP>Impaired apical reuptake of BA into ileal enterocytes is rarely caused by loss-of-function mutations in the apical sodium-dependent BA transporter gene (ASBT), although this impaired ileal BA reabsorption can be used to accelerate colonic transit and treat chronic idiopathic constipation with the small molecule apical sodium-dependent BA transporter inhibitor A3309. Ileal BA transport inhibition by A3309 was associated with increased serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a surrogate for increased hepatic BA synthesis. These data suggest that BAs are natural laxatives functioning mainly in the colon.<SEP>We previously showed that nonsynonymous variations in genes coding for proteins involved in regulation of BA synthesis, specifically a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the KLB gene (KLB rs17618244), are associated with colonic transit in IBS-D. Two genetic variations in FGFR4 rs1966265 and rs351855 modulate KLB rs17618244’s association with colonic transit in IBS-D. In addition, a pharmacogenomics study showed that SNPs in KLB (rs17618244) and FGFR4 (rs376618) influence the degree of acceleration of ascending colonic emptying in constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) treated with the primary bile salt, chenodeoxycholate. FGFR4 (rs351855) is also associated with the deceleration of ascending colonic emptying in IBS-D patients treated with the BA sequestrant colesevelam.<SEP>The mechanism of the association between BA metabolic regulation and the pathogenesis of IBS remains incompletely defined. The relationships of BA synthesis and excretion to stool fat and weight in IBS patients are also poorly characterized. In this study, we aimed to: (1) correlate the degree of BA synthesis and excretion with stool fat and weight in IBS patients and healthy controls; and (2) assess for potential relationships between stool BA excretion and nonsynonymous genetic variations in KLB and FGFR4.","Methods<SEP>Participants<SEP>The study was reviewed and approved by Mayo Clinic’s Institutional Review Board, and each participant provided signed informed consent. From a cohort of approximately 700 previously genotyped IBS patients (based on Rome II criteria) and healthy volunteers (HV), we invited 78 randomly selected participants: 26 HV, 26 IBS-C, and 26 IBS-D patients. These sample sizes were expected to provide approximately 80% power (based on a 2-sample t test using a 2-sided α level of .05 to detect the effect sizes shown in Supplementary Table 1 for the end points of interest (ie, associations with group status corresponding to differences between pairs of groups’ end points of interest), ranging from 18% (stool weight) to 45% (serum C4 and FGF19).<SEP>Protocol<SEP>Participants received Mayo Clinic instructional pamphlets to follow a high-fat (approximately 100 g) diet per day for 4 days: 2 before and 2 during stool collection. A food diary used to record the high-fat diet was dispensed and reviewed with patients by desk personnel. Stool samples were collected over the last 48 hours of the high-fat diet for measuring stool weight, fat content, and BA concentrations. Fasting blood samples were collected and used for measuring serum C4 and FGF19 levels.<SEP>Biochemical Measurements<SEP>We measured serum C4 by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and serum FGF19 by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fat in a 48-hour stool collection was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry at Mayo’s Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.<SEP>Extraction of Bile Acids From Stool and Estimation of Total Stool 3α Hydroxy BAs<SEP>The homogenized stool samples (100–120 mg) were used for extraction of total BAs: 1.5 mL of a solution of 200 mM NaOH and 150 mM NaCl were added to the sample and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes on a shaker. The samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 2 minutes, and supernatant was collected. The aqueous extraction step was repeated 2 more times for a total of 3 extractions. The pellet was finally resuspended in 500 μL of 100% methanol and then centrifuged. The supernatant was added to previously collected aqueous extracts.<SEP>The BA extracts were further purified by using solid-phase extraction on C18 3 cc to 60 mg Oasis HLB columns (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). The columns were activated by adding 1 mL of 100% methanol, washed with 2 mL of water, and equilibrated with 1 mL of a solution of 200 mM NaOH and 150 mM NaCl. The supernatants were applied to columns at 1–2 mL/min using a Cerex-48 N2 gas positive pressure solid phase extraction manifold (SPEware, Baldwin Park, CA). Columns were washed with 1 mL of aqueous extraction buffer and with 2 mL of water. The BAs were eluted in 1 mL of 100% methanol, and the eluates were dried under N2 gas at 45°C for 35 minutes. The dried extracts, which were resuspended in 20 μL of 100% methanol and 480 μL of 50% stripped serum in 150 mM NaCl, were then added to each sample.<SEP>The quantitative determination of total 3α hydroxy BAs (henceforth referred to as “BAs”) was performed on a Cobas c311 Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA) using Diazyme Laboratory Total Bile Acids Assay Kit (Diazyme Lab, Poway, CA). If the concentration of BAs exceeded the linear range of 1–180 μmol/L, samples were diluted with 150 mM NaCl before assay. The final BAs concentration was expressed in μmol/g of homogenized stool and then converted to μmol/24 hours.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>Genotyping of 4 nonsynonymous SNPs in KLB and FGFR4 with minor allele frequencies (MAF) >9% (Supplementary Table 1) was performed as in previous studies, and is summarized in the Supplementary Methods.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>The sample size assessments for specific end points are detailed in Supplementary Table 2 and are based on the variations observed in the data obtained for this study. Most of the end points were not normally distributed and thus the effect sizes listed are only approximate. Because the distribution for most end points was positively skewed, data are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). In general, nonparametric statistical analyses were used. In view of the fact that we included 26 HV in this study, we assessed the proportion of IBS-D patients with abnormally high indexes of BA synthesis or excretion relative to the 90th percentile of the HV. The IQR data also provide the 25th and 75th percentile distributions.<SEP>Spearman correlations were used to explore relationships of BA synthesis and excretion with serum FGF19, stool fat, and stool weight. We tested the associations of the measured responses obtained from blood and stool samples with KLB rs17618244 and FGFR4 rs351855, rs1966265, and rs376618 using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test based on a dominant genetic model. In particular, the associations with phenotype subgroup were assessed univariately (Kruskal–Wallis test).","Results<SEP>Participant Demographics<SEP>Table 1 shows the age, body mass index (BMI), and estimated daily fat intake during the study for each of the 3 subgroups. Previous cholecystectomy was recorded in 23% of IBS-D, approximately 4% of IBS-C, and approximately 4% of HV (P = .05). All patients’ symptoms anteceded the cholecystectomy and were confirmed by study subjects as not significantly aggravated or changed by subsequent cholecystectomy.<SEP>BMI was associated with subgroup (overall P = .036 where the BMI in IBS-D was approximately 4 higher than in IBS-C [P = .026] and HV [P = .022]). Serum FGF19 and stool weight are also shown in Table 1.<SEP>Measurements of BA Synthesis and Excretion, Stool Fat, and Weight<SEP>An overall univariate association of serum C4 with subgroup was identified (overall P = .02) with higher serum C4 (Figure 1) in IBS-D than in IBS-C (P = .02) and HV (P = .01). There were also overall associations of 48-hour stool BA (Figure 2) with subgroup (P = .057), with significantly higher 48-hour stool BA in IBS-D compared with IBS-C (P = .017), but not compared with HV (P = .152). Previous cholecystectomy was also associated with serum C4 (P = .04) and stool BA (P = .05).<SEP>We estimated that 2 out of 17 IBS-D patients (12%; 0/2 had prior cholecystectomy) had elevated stool BA, and 8 out of 21 (38%; 3/8 had prior cholecystectomy) had elevated serum C4, relative to the 90th percentile in the HV. One patient had elevated stool BA and serum C4. Thus, 9 of 21 patients (43%) had increased synthesis or excretion of BA.<SEP>There were numerical differences between subgroups in the 48-hour stool weight and 48-hour stool fat that were not statistically significant, with higher stool weight and stool fat in IBS-D compared with HV, and lower values in IBS-C compared with HV (Supplementary Table 3).<SEP>There was no association of fasting serum FGF19 levels with subgroups.<SEP>Rank Correlations Between BA Synthesis, Excretion, and Stool Fat and Weight<SEP>These are shown in Figures 3–5. There were significant Spearman correlations between serum C4 and FGF19 (rs = −0.324, P = .007), stool weight (rs = 0.366, P = .003), and total stool BA (rs = 0.606, P < .001). Total stool BA correlated with stool weight (rs = 0.737, P < .001) and fat (rs = 0.528, P < .001). BMI correlated with serum C4 (rs = 0.423, P < .001) and total stool BA (rs = 0.507, P < .001).<SEP>Relationship of Candidate Genetic Variants to BA Synthesis and Stool Excretion<SEP>FGFR4 rs1966265 was marginally associated with stool BA (P = .032, not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons with 4 different SNPs tested), but not with serum C4. There were no significant associations of serum C4 or stool BA with KLB rs17618244, FGFR4 rs351855, or FGFR4 rs376618 tested.","Discussion<SEP>This study demonstrates that IBS-D patients, unselected for clinical response to BA binding, have evidence of higher hepatic BA synthesis and stool BA excretion compared with control subjects and patients with IBS-C. In IBS-D, the upper quartile for 48-hour stool weight and fat were, respectively, 481 g and 8 g, and the 90th percentile for stool fat was 15 g/48 hours. These data suggest that about 25% of IBS-D patients had increased 48-hour stool weight, but that the stool fat was within the normal range in most patients (14 g/48 hours). Overall, these data confirm that a subgroup of patients with IBS-D have increased stool weight that is associated with high BA synthesis and excretion. In fact, the median serum C4 was 32.7 pg/mL in IBS-D, while the 90th percentile for HV was 37.6 pg/mL, suggesting that almost 40% of IBS-D patients in this cohort have increased serum C4, a marker of BA synthesis rate. Similarly, median stool BA in IBS-D was 864 μmol/24 hours and the 75th percentile in health was 762 μmol/24 hours. In contrast to the deficiency of BA and sulfation of BA in a subset of children with constipation, we did not observe deficiencies of BA in patients with IBS-C. However, it is important to note that some patients had extremely low stool BA excretion, and that the BA assay used does not detect sulfated BAs. Therefore, it is possible that we may have missed identifying a subgroup with normal stool BA output, but in the chemical form of sulfated BAs among the IBS-C group. Retardation of colonic transit by octreotide in acromegalic patients is associated with increased serum deoxycholic acid, which may result from the increased bacterial 7α-dehydroxylation of the primary BA, cholic acid, by colonic bacteria, and with greater colonic absorption of the secondary BA.<SEP>The BA synthesis and excretion were also significantly associated with higher stool weight and stool fat across the 3 groups of participants. We have confirmed the reciprocal relationship between fasting serum C4 and FGF19 levels originally demonstrated by Walters et al.<SEP>One interpretation of our findings is that the differences in BA biosynthesis or stool excretion cause the increased stool weight and the clinical presentation of IBS-D. However, an alternative interpretation is that rapid colonic transit may decrease colonic BA absorption, whereas slow transit may increase colonic BA absorption, with these differences in absorption then resulting in increased BA synthesis in IBS-D and decreased BA synthesis in IBS-C.<SEP>Stool BA measurement is the gold standard in the diagnosis of BAM and BA diarrhea; however, the demanding nature of stool collection and processing led to the development of a radionuclide-based synthetic BA retention test, the 75selenium homocholic acid taurine retention test. This is the preferred diagnostic modality in countries where the test is available. In countries where 75selenium homocholic acid taurine retention test is not available, such as the United States, stool BA remains the best choice for ruling out BAM because it provides direct assessment of the amount of BA transiting and exiting through the lower gastrointestinal tract.<SEP>An alternative, nonspecific marker of BAM is serum C4, which reflects the rate of hepatic BA synthesis; however, serum C4 may be elevated with alcohol use, chronic liver disease, and hypertriglyceridemia, and paradoxically, very high serum C4 has also been described in constipated patients with slow oral-anal transit time. Another test proposed for BAM is serum FGF19; this may be elevated in cholestatic liver disease and decreased in obesity.<SEP>In view of known diurnal variations in serum C4 and FGF19 levels, we collected blood in the morning, with patients fasting. We did not detect differences in serum FGF19 between the 3 subgroups. We anticipated reduced serum FGF19 in IBS-D patients, based on studies by Walters et al in 17 patients, of whom approximately 25% had values within the range observed in 19 HV. We have confirmed the overall significant inverse correlation between serum C4 and FGF19 (rs = −0.324, P = .007) reported in the literature. These data suggest that mechanisms other than ileal FGF19 deficiency may result in BAM in patients with IBS-D.<SEP>In contrast to our previous study in which the functional KLB variation rs17618244 mediating KLB protein stability was associated with accelerated colonic transit in patients with IBS-D, there was no significant association between markers of BAM and this KLB variation.<SEP>On the other hand, our finding that a genetic variation in FGFR4, 1 of the 2 receptor proteins located on hepatocytes, had borderline significant association with stool BA excretion (P = .032) and hence with BAM, supports the hypothesis that genetic variation in the pathways of BA synthesis may be etiologically important. We regard the current study as hypothesis-generating from the perspective of understanding the mechanisms of BAM in IBS-D patients.<SEP>We observed significant positive correlations between serum C4, stool BA, and stool weight. These are expected physiologically, as high hepatic synthesis and delivery to the colon are expected to increase colonic motility and secretion and, hence, stool weight. The positive correlation between stool BA and stool fat may reflect the impairment of BA absorption in the ileum, resulting in increased stool BAs and ultimately resulting in BA depletion and abnormal micelle formation and fat mal-absorption. This has been classically described in patients with ileal resection. However, mild steatorrhea has also been observed in patients with “nonorganic” BAM and functional diarrhea. Further studies of BA balance are required to explore the hypothesis that BA loss in patients with IBS-D may eventually exceed the hepatic BA synthesis rate and lead to steatorrhea.<SEP>We also identified significant overall associations of higher BMI with elevations in both BA synthesis and excretion. Higher BMI has previously been described in healthy subjects with accelerated colonic transit. Higher BMI has also been observed in those with idiopathic BAM compared with HV. In our current study, BMI was significantly and positively correlated with hepatic BA synthesis and stool BA excretion, as reflected by serum C4 and stool BA, respectively. BMI was higher by approximately 4 in IBS-D patients relative to both IBS-C patients and HV in our current cohort. These results provide support for the hypothesis that excess body mass is linked to accelerated colonic transit and diarrhea by a mechanism of excessive BA synthesis and excretion, as seen in the IBS-D group. Further investigation is required to clarify the exact pathogenetic mechanism; specifically, whether derangements in BA metabolism precede and contribute to gain in body mass, or the opposite temporal sequence.<SEP>Accelerated colonic transit has previously been described in healthy subjects with higher BMI. Higher BMI has also been observed in those with idiopathic BAM compared with HV. In our current study, higher BMI was significantly correlated with both increased hepatic BA synthesis and luminal BA excretion, as reflected by higher serum C4 and stool BA, respectively. BMI was higher by approximately 4 in IBS-D patients relative to both IBS-C patients and HV in our current cohort. Our results support the hypothesis that obesity is linked to accelerated colonic transit and diarrhea by excessive BA synthesis and excretion.<SEP>In summary, our study provides important confirmation that BAM is a potential mechanism for the diarrhea in patients with IBS-D, and that total stool BA or, perhaps more conveniently, serum C4 may be used to identify patients with BAM. Based on our current study, we estimate that serum C4 would identify 43% (9 of 21) of IBS-D patients with BAM, for whom more specific therapy with BA sequestrants such as cholesty-ramine or the more easily tolerated agent, colesevelam, may be effective. Total stool BA excretion is marginally associated with FGFR4 genetic variation. Further studies of BA synthesis and excretion, colonic transit, and genotype in larger numbers of IBS-D are under way.",19315,['FOODIN']
25799058,"Introduction<SEP>Modification of proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation (ubiquitylation) regulates protein degradation, activity, localization and interactions and thus is involved in most cellular processes. Proteins can be attached to a single Ub, or to a Ub chain, where the C-terminal glycine residue of each Ub is linked to the N-terminal methionine residue or one of the seven lysine residues of the following Ub. Ubiquitylated targets promote different cellular signaling, depending on the chain length and/or linkage between Ub moieties. This feature primarily relies on the recognition of Ub by Ub-binding domains (UBDs). To date, more than twenty classes of UBDs have been identified. Several UBDs recognize Ub chains with specificity towards the linkage between Ub moieties. For example, Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) of TAB2/3, tandem Ub-interacting motif (tUIM) of RAP80 and CARD domain of RIG-I specifically bind K63-linked Ub chains (K63 chains), while HOIL-1L NZF, A20 zinc finger 7 and UBAN domain of NEMO specifically bind M1-linked Ub chains (M1 chains). Three-dimensional structures of these UBDs in complex with their cognate Ub chains have provided important insights into mechanisms for the linkage specificities.<SEP>Recently, Ub-binding zinc fingers (UBZs) have emerged as potential K63-linkage-specific UBDs. Five publications reported that UBZs of RAD18, WRNIP1, FAAP20 and SLX4 bind specifically K63 chains, unlike those of Polη, Polκ, and FAN1, which seem to bind mono-ubiquitylated targets. The interaction between UBZ and Ub or Ub chains plays important roles in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and other replication blocking DNA damage. Upon ICL formation, RNF8 together with UBC13-MMS2 or UBC13-UEV1a rapidly assembles K63 chains on histone H2A and other targets. Several publications indicate that K63 chains are recognized by the UBZ domain of FAAP20 (FAAP20-UBZ), which recruits the FA core complex (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, FANCM, FAAP20, FAAP24 and FAAP100) through its interaction with FANCA. Within the FA core complex, FANCL mono-ubiquitylates FANCI/FANCD2. This activity relies on RAD6/RAD18 ubiquitylation of PCNA. The E3 ligase RAD18 itself possesses a UBZ domain, which seems important for recruitment of RAD6/RAD18 to DNA damage sites. Thereafter, nucleases are recruited to cleave off damaged DNA. Notably, FAN1 and SLX4 nucleases possess UBZ domains. The UBZ domain of FAN1 binds mono-ubiquitylated FANCI/FANCD2. On the other hand, the SLX4 UBZ domain seems to bind K63 chains, although its precise target is still unidentified. The gap left by nucleases is filled using specialized polymerase, including Polν, Polζ and REV1. Recently, REV1 was shown to be ubiquitylated and this ubiquitylation may trigger the recruitment of FAAP20. However, this function contradicts other papers, because mono-ubiquitylation of REV1 seems sufficient to recruit FAAP20, suggesting that FAAP20-UBZ can bind Ub as well as Ub chains in vivo. The linkage specificity of FAAP20-UBZ is still controversial.<SEP>In this study, to clarify the specificity of FAAP20-UBZ towards Ub and Ub chains, we solved the crystal structure of FAAP20-UBZ in complex with K63-linked Ub2 at 1.9 Å resolution. The present complex structure and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrometric analysis showed that FAAP20-UBZ binds Ub and K63-, M1- and K48-linked Ub2 species with similar affinities. FAAP20-UBZ structure lacks the anti-parallel β sheets and differs from the canonical ββα fold found in the other UBZ structures identified so far. FAAP20-UBZ contains an α-helix reminiscent of other Ub-binding domain, the following Ub-binding loop and a stabilizing loop at the N-terminal extremity. Site-directed mutational analyses revealed that Ub-interacting residues of FAAP20-UBZ are critical for binding to Ub in vitro and accumulation of FAAP20 to ICL sites in vivo.","Materials and Methods<SEP>Preparation of FAAP20-UBZ<SEP>The gene encoding human FAAP20-UBZ (residues 142–180) was PCR amplified from a human cDNA library. The amplified gene was cloned into the pCold-GST expression vector with NdeI and XhoI sites to produce N-terminal GST fusion protein and confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the expression vector and cultured in LB media containing 100 mg/L ampicillin at 37°C. When the optical density at 600 nm of the culture reached ~0.5, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mM to induce protein expression for 24 h at 15°C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 7,000 g for 15 minutes and disrupted by sonication in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5% Triton X-100. The lysates were centrifuged at 28,000 g for 60 minutes and the supernatants were then loaded onto a Glutathione Sepharose FF (Qiagen) column that had been pre-equilibrated with PBS containing 1 mM DTT and 0.5% Triton X-100. The column was washed with the PBS containing 1 mM DTT and 0.5% Triton X-100 and then with PBS containing 1 mM DTT. GST fusion samples were eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 15 mM reduced glutathione. The samples were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT. The proteins were loaded onto a ResourceQ anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM DTT and were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1M NaCl. The peak fractions containing FAAP20-UBZ were collected, and the GST-tags were cleaved by HRV3C protease at 4°C. The samples were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex75 (prep grade) column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The peak fractions containing purified FAAP20-UBZ were collected.<SEP>Crystallization and data collection<SEP>To prepare FAAP20-UBZ•K63-Ub2 complex, a 1.5-fold molar excess of FAAP20-UBZ was incubated at 4°C overnight with K63-Ub2 that was prepared as described previously. The FAAP20-UBZ•K63-Ub2 complex was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex75 (prep grade) column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, to remove unbound K63-Ub2. Purified FAAP20-UBZ•K63-Ub2 complex was concentrated to ~10 g/L, by using an Amicon Ultra-4 3,000 MWCO filter (Millipore), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Initial crystallization screening was performed using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20°C, with a Mosquito liquid-handling robot (TTP Lab Tech). We tested about 400 conditions, using crystallization reagent kits supplied by Hampton Research, and initial hits were further optimized. The best crystals of the FAAP20-UBZ•K63-Ub2 complex grew at 20°C with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 0.5 μl of a protein solution with an equal amount of a precipitant solution containing 1.8 M DL-malic acid (pH 7.0), 0.1 M glycine. For data collection, the crystals of the FAAP20-UBZ•K63-Ub2 complex were transferred to the precipitant solution containing saturated trehalose for cryoprotection. Cryoprotected crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.<SEP>Structural determination and refinement<SEP>Diffraction data sets were collected at the beamline BL41XU in SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan), and they were processed with the program HKL2000 and the CCP4 program suite. The crystal of the FAAP20-UBZ•K63-Ub2 complex belongs to the space group P21, with unit cell dimensions of a = 59.8 Å, b = 45.9 Å, c = 172.9 Å, β = 98.1°. The complex structures were determined by molecular replacement using the program MolRep. The crystal structure of Ub (PDB code: 1ubq) was used as the search model. The atomic model of FAAP20-UBZ was built to fit 2F o-F c electron density map using the program COOT with careful inspection. Refinement was carried out using the program Refmac5 with iterative correction and refinement of the atomic model. The final model has excellent stereochemistry with an R free value of 23.5% at 1.90 Å resolution. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in S1 Table. All molecular graphics were prepared using the program PyMOL (DeLano Scientific; http://www.pymol.org).<SEP>SPR analysis<SEP>GST-fused Ub and M1-Ub2 for SPR analyses were purified by Glutathione Sepharose FF and ResourceQ anion exchange columns (GE Healthcare). GST-fused K48-Ub2 was synthesized from Ub with an additional aspartate residue at its C-terminal extremity (D77 Ub) and GST-fused Ub carrying the K48R mutation. GST-fused K63-Ub2 was synthesized from D77 Ub and GST-fused K63R Ub. Ub conjugation reactions were performed as described previously. Site-directed FAAP20-UBZ mutants were purified similarly to wild-type FAAP20-UBZ (see above). Experiments were carried out on a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare) equilibrated at 25°C in HBS-P buffer including 10 mM HEPES-Na (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% surfactant P 20, using a Sensor Chip C1 (GE Healthcare). Anti-GST antibodies (GE Healthcare) were covalently immobilized on the sensor chip at a density of about 1,800 resonance units (RU), and GST-fused Ub and Ub2 were captured on the sensor chip at a density of 200–400 RU. FAAP20-UBZ proteins were then injected for 60 sec at a flow rate of 10 μL∕ min. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) were computed by fitting to a 1:1 interaction model using Biacore T200 evaluation software (GE Healthcare). All assays were carried out three times for each sample. The data are presented as means ± SD.<SEP>GST pull-down assays<SEP>GST-fused FAAP20-UBZs and FAAP20 were produced and purified similarly to FAAP20-UBZ, without the HRV3C protease digestion step. GST, GST-fused FAAP20 and GST-fused FAAP20-UBZ were immobilized on Glutathione Sepharose FF beads pre-equilibrated in a pull-down buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton, 100 mM NaCl) and then incubated with K63-, K48- or linear Ub2 for 15 min at 4°C on ice in the pull-down buffer. The beads were extensively washed with the same buffer thrice. The diubiquitin molecules bound to the beads were released by incubating in SDS loading buffer without boiling, analyzed by SDS–PAGE and stained by Coomassie brilliant blue.<SEP>Protein recruitment to laser-induced localized ICLs<SEP>GM0637 cells (a simian virus 40-transformed human fibroblast cell line) were seeded in a 35 mm glass bottom culture dish, and they were incubated with 6 μM trioxalen at 37°C for 20 min prior to laser treatment. Thereafter, the DMEM was replaced by Leivobitz's L-15 (Gibco) containing 10% FBS and 25 mM HEPES (Gibco) and incubated at 37°C. After 10 min, the glass bottom culture dish was mounted on the microscope stage and maintained at 37°C throughout an experiment. UVA microirradiation experiment and live-cell imaging analysis were performed using a ZEISS LSM780 confocal laser-scanning microscope with a C-apochromat 63x /1.20 W Korr M27 objective. The 355 nm line of laser-UVA was used for microirradiation (three pulses at 520 μW), and images were acquired before and at 10 min after microirradiation. Cells were fixed immediately after image acquisition of GFP signals at 10 min after microirradiation with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Thereafter, cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with mouse anti-γH2AX antibodies (1:20,000; Upstate) in PBS containing 1% BSA at 37°C for 30 min. Alexa Fluo 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:2,000; Molecular Probes) was used as the secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Samples were examined with a ZEISS Axioplan2 microscope controlled by Axiovision. At least 20 cells were microirradiated and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopic analyses in each experiment.","Results and Discussion<SEP>Overall structure of FAAP20-UBZ in complex with K63-linked Ub2 <SEP>FAAP20 is a 20 kDa protein, which binds to FANCA through its N-terminal region and contains a conserved UBZ domain in its C terminal extremity. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the specific interaction between FAAP20-UBZ and Ub chains, we determined the crystal structure of FAAP20-UBZ (residues 143–180) in complex with K63-linked Ub2 (K63-Ub2) at 1.9 Å resolution (S1 Table). Unlike other UBZ structures determined so far, FAAP20-UBZ lacks the two short β strands found in the classical ββα-fold (Fig. 1). The central α-helix (residues 160–173) is flanked between two loops (residues 143–159 and 174–180, respectively). A zinc ion is coordinated by the conserved residues Cys147, Cys150, His166 and Cys170 and bridges the first loop and the α-helix. Both the α-helix and the second loop interact with the distal Ub of K63-Ub2. In contrast, the proximal Ub does not interact with FAAP20 but contact two distinct neighboring proximal ubiquitins in the crystal through their Ile44 patches (S1 Fig.). Lys63 of one distal ubiquitin could not be linked to Gly76 of its neighboring ubiquitins. The distances between Leu71 of one distal ubiquitin and Lys63 of its neighboring ubiquitins are 34.0 Å and 34.8 Å, which are much longer than the length of the flexible C-terminal region of ubiquitin (Leu71-Gly76) that links two ubiquitins (16.4 Å). Consequently, FAAP20-UBZ interacts with one Ub moiety of K63-Ub2 in the present structure of the FAAP20-UBZ•K63-Ub2 complex, suggesting that FAAP20-UBZ can bind Ub as well as K63 and other chains.<SEP>To assess this possibility, we measured the affinity of FAAP20-UBZ with Ub or K63-, K48- or M1-linked Ub2 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy (Table 1 and S2 Fig.). FAAP20-UBZ binds Ub efficiently (K d = 19.9 μM). The equilibrium dissociation constant is lower than those of other UBDs. In particular, the binding affinity of FAAP20-UBZ for Ub seems higher than that of the Polη UBZ (K d = 81 μM, measured by isothermal titration calorimetry). The equilibrium dissociation constants of FAAP20-UBZ for the Ub2 species are either equivalent (M1) or twice higher (K63 and K48) than that for Ub. Therefore, FAAP20-UBZ can bind Ub and has little linkage specificity towards M1-, K48- and K63-linked Ub2 species. In the FAAP20-UBZ•K63-Ub2 structure, one FAAP20-UBZ molecule interacts with one K63-Ub2 molecule. This 1:1 stoichiometry may be an artifact of crystallization, because, in our SPR experiment, the actual R max for binding of FAAP20-UBZ to K63-Ub2 is 30.0 ± 2.2 resonance units (RU), which is significantly higher than the theoretical R max calculated from a 1:1 stoichiometry model (18.8 ± 0.4 RU) and slightly lower than that from a 2:1 (UBZ:Ub2) model (37.6 ± 0.9 RU). Therefore, two FAAP20-UBZ molecules can simultaneously bind the two Ub moieties of K63-Ub2 in solution.<SEP>In addition, we tested the interaction of FAAP20 with K63-, K48- or M1-linked Ub2 by GST-pulldown assay. As shown in S3 Fig., both the full-length FAAP20 (1–180) and FAAP20-UBZ (142–180) can similarly bind these three different diubiquitin chains. Altogether our data indicate that FAAP20 does not display any Ub chain specificity in apparent contradiction with two previous publications, which suggested that FAAP20-UBZ preferentially binds K63 chains over K48 chains. Both relied on GST-pull down experiments, where the input ubiquitin chains had different length between K63 and K48-linked chains. In contrast, pull-down experiments using K63 and K48 chains of similar length did not show any difference, consistent with our data. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other subunit(s) in the FA core complex might confer K63 specificity to FAAP20-UBZ. FANCA could be the candidate, because it directly binds to FAAP20.<SEP>Interactions between FAAP20-UBZ and Ub<SEP>Both hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds constitute the interaction between FAAP20-UBZ and Ub. At the UBZ α helix, the side chains of Leu161, Leu167, Ala168, Leu171 and Ala172 and the aliphatic portion of Asp164 hydrophobically interact with the canonical Ile44-centered hydrophobic patch of Ub, which is formed by the side chains of Leu8, Ile44 and Val70 and the aliphatic portions of Thr66 and His68 side chains (Fig. 2A). The Asp164 Oδ atoms of FAAP20-UBZ further hydrogen bond with the main-chain amide groups of Ala46 and Gly47 of Ub, respectively. Trp180, which is located at the C-terminal extremity of the second loop of FAAP20-UBZ, also participates in the hydrophobic interaction with Ile44 of Ub. In addition, its Nε atom hydrogen bonds with the main-chain CO group of Gly47 of Ub (Fig. 2B). At the C-terminal part of the UBZ α-helix, the main-chain CO group of Leu171 hydrogen bonds with the Nη atom of Ub Arg72. The following second loop of FAAP20-UBZ also interacts with Arg72 of Ub. The main-chain CO groups of Ser174 and Thr175 in FAAP20-UBZ hydrogen bond with the two Nη atoms of Arg72 in Ub, respectively. Moreover, the two Oδ atoms of Asp177 on the second loop hydrogen bond with Nε and Nη of Arg42 in Ub, respectively, and the main-chain CO group of Val178 hydrogen bonds with Nε of Gln49 in Ub.<SEP>Contribution of these intermolecular interactions to Ub binding was examined by SPR analysis of site-directed FAAP20-UBZ mutants (Table 2 and S4 Fig.). No binding could be measured with mutations D164A, A168L and W180A, similarly to a mutation of a zinc-coordinating residue Cys150, which disables the bridging between the first loop and the central α-helix and thus likely destabilizes the FAAP20-UBZ structure. These results indicate that the central core interactions are essential for Ub binding. On the other hand, binding of L161A, A172L and D177A mutants was significantly reduced but could be measured. L161A, A172L and D177A mutations decreased the affinities 6.3-, 5.7- and 10.9-fold, respectively. Therefore, Ub binding of FAAP20-UBZ relies primarily on the central core interactions, which is enhanced by their surrounding interactions.<SEP>In vivo accumulation of FAAP20 to ICL sites, depending on the UBZ–Ub interaction<SEP>After ICL formation, FAAP20 is recruited to DNA damage sites. This localization requires a functional UBZ domain. We tested if FAAP20 proteins bearing the aforementioned mutations were still able to localize to ICL sites. We generated ICLs by irradiating cells with UVA after pre-incubation with psoralen and monitored accumulation of GFP-tagged FAAP20 to DNA damage sites by confocal imaging (Fig. 3). Wild-type FAAP20 was accumulated to ICL sites 10 minutes after psoralen-UVA treatment, as shown in previous studies. In contrast, C150S, D164A, A168L and W180A mutants adopted a diffuse localization throughout the cells. Therefore, the residues that are essential for Ub binding in vitro are also required for proper recruitment of FAAP20 to DNA damage sites in vivo. These results also ensure that binding between FAAP20-UBZ and Ub is physiologically essential for the recruitment of FAAP20 to DNA damage sites.<SEP>Comparison of FAAP20-UBZ with WRNIP1-, RAD18-, Polη- and NEMO-UBZ<SEP>The Ub-interacting residues of FAAP20-UBZ are conserved or replaced by functionally equivalent residues among human, mouse, rat, chicken and puffy fish (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, we could not assess the conservation of these residues among other UBZs, due to their highly divergent amino-acid sequences. Three-dimensional structural information is required to correctly align their sequences.<SEP>To date, UBZ structures of WRNIP1 and RAD18 have been solved in complex with Ub. The Ub-interacting residues are conserved between both proteins. WRNIP1-UBZ (PDB code: 3VHT) and RAD18-UBZ (PDB code: 2MRE) display the canonical ββα fold, in which the loop between both antiparallel β-strands (β-loop) and the α-helix interact with Ub. As shown in Fig. 4B, the central α-helix of WRNIP1 occupies a position similar to the C-terminal loop of FAAP20. Arg42 of Ub interacts with Asp37 in the α-helix of WRNIP1 and Asp177 in the C-terminal loop of FAAP20. Similarly, the β-loop of WRNIP1 occupies a part of the FAAP20 α-helix position. In particular, Ile44 of Ub interacts with Pro21 and Val22 in the β-loop, in place of Ala168 and Leu167 in the α-helix of FAAP20.<SEP>Next, we analyzed other members of the UBZ family. UBZ structures of Polη and NEMO (Polη- and NEMO-UBZ, respectively) have been solved in isolated forms. Both NEMO-UBZ (PDB code: 2JVX) and Polη-UBZ (PDB code: 2I5O) seem to interact with Ub in a manner different from RAD18-UBZ and WRNIP1-UBZ. The highly conserved Pro21-Val22 in the β-loop of WRNIP1 are replaced by Pro398-Lys399 in NEMO-UBZ and Glu636-Lys637 in Polη (Fig. 4A). The presence of charged residues should disrupt the hydrophobic interaction with Ile44. In contrast, four Ub-interacting residues of FAAP20-UBZ (i.e., Asp164, Leu167, Ala168 and Leu171) are conserved or replaced by a functionally equivalent residue in Polη-UBZ (i.e., Asp652, Phe655, Ala656 and Leu659) (Fig. 4A and S5 Fig.). This sequence conservation suggests that Polη-UBZ binds Ub in a similar manner to FAAP20-UBZ. On the other hand, these residues are poorly conserved in NEMO-UBZ, where Asp164, Leu167, Ala168 and Leu171 of FAAP20-UBZ are replaced by Gln411, Val414, Met415 and Ile418, respectively. Importantly, the side chain of Met415 of NEMO-UBZ is much larger than that of Ala168 of FAAP20-UBZ and thus cannot fit in the Ile44-centered hydrophobic patch of Ub, suggesting a different mode of interaction with Ub (Fig. 4 and S5 Fig.). The alanine residue corresponding to Ala168 of FAAP20-UBZ seems also missing in other UBZs including WRNIP1 and RAD18 (Fig. 5).<SEP>Altogether, our data suggest the presence of at least three groups of UBZ domains (Fig. 5). In the FAAP20/Polη group, the β-loop is absent or too divergent, so that Ile44 interacts with hydrophobic residues in the α-helix. The WRNIP1/Rad18 group interacts with Ile44 of Ub through their β-loop. Finally, the third group of UBZ domains comprises proteins that possess neither the FAAP20-UBZ residues involved in Ub-binding (highlighted in red) nor the RAD18-UBZ residues involved in Ub-binding (highlighted in black), and their mode of interaction should be different from the two other groups. The UBZ domains have been classified, according to the zinc coordinating residues (namely type 3 for CCHH and type 4 for CCHC). However, this classification seems not appropriate for representing the structural information, since several type-3 UBZs interact differently with Ub (NEMO-UBZ, FAAP20-UBZ and WRNIP1-UBZ).<SEP>Comparison of FAAP20-UBZ with other UBDs<SEP>To further investigate whether the UBZ-Ub interface resembles other UBD-Ub interface, we compared the Ub-interacting α-helix of FAAP20-UBZ with Ub-binding single α-helix motifs such as UIM (Ub-interacting motif) and MIU (motif interacting with Ub, also known as IUIM [inverted UIM]) (Fig. 6). Three-dimensional structures of the UIM domain of Vps27 (Vps27-UIM) (PDB code: 1Q0W) and the MIU domain of Rabex5 (Rabex5-MIU) (PDB code: 2C7M and 2FIF) have been solved in complex with Ub. Rabex5-MIU and FAAP20-UBZ are orientated in the same direction, relative to the bound Ub. Remarkably, critical residues involved in Ub binding are strictly identical between Rabex5-MIU and FAAP20-UBZ. Thus, the α-helix-mediated Ub-interaction of FAAP20-UBZ is closely related to that of MIU. Although the UIM polarity towards the bound Ub is opposite to FAAP20-UBZ and Rabex5-MIU, most of the Ub-interacting residues on the α-helix are identical or functionally equivalent among Vps27-UIM, FAAP20-UBZ and Rabex5-MIU, suggesting convergent evolution of these three distinct Ub-binding motifs.",,23790,['FOODIN']
34042155,"Introduction<SEP>Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-related disorder of gastrointestinal system, which is triggered by ingestion of gluten peptide found in cereals like wheat, rye and barley. Originally, CD was thought to exclusively affect white Europeans, but recent reports indicate its increasing prevalence in diverse ethnic groups like Caucasians, Africans, Arabs and South Asians. This increasing frequency of CD could be attributed to the rapid changes in lifestyle and diet and also due to the recent developments in diagnostic procedures. Recent studies indicates that the prevalence of CD ranges from 0.6% to 1.1% among the Middle Eastern arab countries. Although CD is considered a major health problem in the Middle Eastern region, exact frequency of CD remains elusive due to the lack of large scale data. Patients with classical CD presents gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations like diarrhea, malabsorption, abdominal pain and distension, bloating, vomiting, and weight loss. Currently, gluten-free food is the standard dietary restriction to manage the disease complications.<SEP>The strongest genetic predisposing factors known to explain 25–40% of CD’s heritability are, human leukocyte antigen DQ (HLA-DQ) class II haplotypes, which are formed by variants in the highly polymorphic HLA -DQA1 and -DQB1 genes. HLA genes encode cell surface receptors of most antigen presenting cells, which forms a cleft that binds to gliadin peptides. The genetics of the various HLA haplotypes that contribute to CD development is complex, as the disease risk is basically determined by the number and configuration of the DQA1 and DQB1 alleles. About 90–95% of CD patients share HLA-DQ2 heterodimer (encoded by HLA-DQA1*0501 and HLA-DQB1*02 alleles) and the remaining patients carry HLA-DQ8 heterodimer (encoded by HLA-DQA1*0301 and HLA-DQB1*0302 alleles). It is extremely rare for individuals negative for both DQ2 and DQ8 risk alleles to develop CD. Therefore, due to its very high negative predictive value, HLA typing has become a standard exclusion criteria in CD diagnosis. Even though HLA-DQ haplotypes are major predisposing genetic factors, they are not sufficient to develop the disease because only 20–30% of the normal population carry these HLA-DQ variants. This fact supports the contribution of other HLA and non-HLA genetic loci regions in CD predisposition.<SEP>Traditionally, CD linked HLA risk variants are genotyped by PCR-based HLA typing using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP), sequence-specific primers (SSP), and Sanger sequencing-based typing (SBT) methods. No doubt that these methods have improved the HLA typing, but several inherent limitations like time-consuming and expensive protocols, low throughput, unphased data and ambiguity of results limits their widespread use in molecular diagnosis. In this regard, Monsuur et al. has developed a simple, high-throughput allelic discrimination method to rapidly predict the DQ2.5, DQ2.2, DQ7, and DQ8 risk alleles using tagSNPs. This tag SNP approach has shown >94.0% predictive value for CD diagnosis, with >96.8% of sensitivity and >99.4% of specificity, when tested among European population. This method was then eventually used for population screening to determine the prevalence of CD HLA risk alleles in few other ethnic groups.<SEP>To the best of our knowledge, data on the distribution of HLA locus gene variants and their relevance to CD diagnosis among Saudi population are limited. Therefore, our study is aimed to assess the utility of real-time PCR based tagSNPs to provide new information on HLA-DQ risk haplotypes associated with CD in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the present study has also aimed to investigate the distribution of these HLA risk alleles among CD patients and healthy population in Saudi Arabia.","Materials and methods<SEP>Recruitment of study subjects and sampling<SEP>Ethical approval for this study was granted from the Research Ethics Committee, King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah. Unrelated Saudi nationals with CD were recruited from a Pediatric Gastroenterology clinic; all cases were examined at the Department of Genetic Medicine for obtaining information about the prevalence of disease among other family members and the comorbidities. A total of 101 sporadic CD patients were clinically diagnosed based on the guidelines of European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPHGAN) which includes serology testing for antibodies against gliadin and endomysium (EMA) or tissue transglutaminase (tTG) followed by small bowel biopsy to confirm the diagnosis for serology positive results.<SEP>Additionally, 103 healthy Saudi controls, who are over 20 years old, having no personal or family history for allergies, autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (Diabetes, Rhematic arthritis, and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) were randomly recruited from volunteers. All the enrolled participants and the parents of the children (<16 years) were informed about the study processes before obtaining written informed consent to participate in the present study. We collected 5 ml of peripheral blood samples in EDTA vacutainers from all participants and stored at −20°C until DNA extraction procedure was conducted.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>Genomic DNA isolation<SEP>We isolated DNA from the 200 μl blood samples with QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Catalogue # 51306). DNA Quality and quantity measurements were done using NanoDrop™ 2000c Spectrophotometer.<SEP>Genotyping for HLA-DQ tag SNPs<SEP>TaqMan®Genotyping assay (Applied Biosystems) was run by using 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystem, Int., U.S.A.). to genotype the individuals for the four HLA tag SNPs (rs7775228, rs2395182, rs2187668, and rs7454108) listed in Table 1 with chromosomal positions shown in Figure 1. TaqMan®Genotyper Software (Applied Biosystem, int. U.S.A.) was used to analyze scatter plots of test samples.<SEP>HLA genotype notation using the tagSNPs<SEP>The genotype status of the tagSNPs is used to interpret HLA-DQ haplotypes as presented in Table 2. As per the original study published the Mansuur et al., the homozygous (for major or minor allele) or heterozygous (both major and minor alleles) status of the queried tag SNP will predict the individual’s HLA-DQ haplotype status due to its strong Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) value seen among Caucasian population (r2 value >0.99).<SEP>The determination of HLA-DQ2.5 and DQ8 haplotypes is straight forward and is predicted by the genotype status of rs2187668 and rs7454108 SNPs, respectively. Whereas DQ2.2 haplotype was determined based on the genotype status of 2 tagSNPs i.e., ‘T’ (major allele) for rs2395182 and ‘C’ (minor allele) for rs7775228. The homozygous statuses of TT (rs2395182) and CC (rs7775228) for both the tag SNPs suggest that the individual is homozygous to DQ2.2 haplotype. In case of DQ2.2 heterozygous haplotype, individuals will have either of the GT-CT, GT-CC or TT-CT genotype combinations for the rs2395182 and rs7775228 tag SNPs. The individuals who are not carrying either ‘T’ (rs2395182) or ‘C’ (rs7775228) alleles in the abovementioned combination were considered to be negative for DQ2.5/DQ2.2 and DQ8 haplotypes and carrying a different HLA-DQ haplotype (DQx), Table 2.<SEP>Validation of genotype calls<SEP>To check the accuracy and reproducibility of SNP genotyping assay, we performed Sanger sequencing of 100 random DNA samples from both CD patients and controls and compared the results between these two approaches. Prior to Sanger sequencing, the PCR products were purified using QIA quick PCR Purification Kit following the manufacturer instructions (Qiagen, Alameda, CA, U.S.A.). Purified PCR products were used as a DNA template for cycle sequencing reactions using ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, U.S.A.). The reaction mixture of cycle sequencing PCR consists of 1 μl of big dye, 2 μl of 5× big dye buffer, 1 µl of either forward or reverse primer, and 1 μl of purified PCR product and 5μl nuclease-free water. Bioedit software 6 version was used for alignment and identifying the sequence variants.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>To assess the CD risk conferred by different HLA genotypes, we conducted the analysis using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 14.0. Statistically significant difference in allele and genotypes was determined using Pearson’s standard chi-squared test, odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) and P value <0.05 was considered significant.","Results<SEP>Clinical analysis<SEP>The present study included a total of 101 CD patients (45 males and 56 females), and the 103 healthy controls (43 males and 60 females). The mean age of patients was found to be 28.8 ± 13.9 years and for controls it was 31.6 ± 8.8 years. Of the study participants, 30% of the patients and 50% of the controls were born to consanguineous parents. The common clinical symptoms seen in CD patients were as follows: chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia and abdominal distension. The common autoimmune manifestations seen in our patient group were type 1 diabetes mellitus (32%), autoimmune thyroiditis (8%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (3%). We also observed few non-autoimmune disease manifestations like osteomalacia (5%), seizure disorders (4%), and Down syndrome (4%).<SEP>Real time PCR genotyping results<SEP>HLA tagSNPs- allelic frequency distribution analysis<SEP>In Table 3, of the 4 HLA-tag SNPs tested, only three (rs2395182, rs7775228, and rs2187668) have shown the significant difference in minor allele frequency distribution among CD patients in comparison with healthy controls. Our statistical results for rs2395182 have indicated that the minor ‘G’ allele is more prevalent in healthy controls (18%) than in CD group (10%) [P=0.015, OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.138–3.562]. For rs7775228 SNP, significant differences in the frequency of minor ‘C’ allele among controls (21%) and CD patients (14%) was observed [P=0.0497; OR = 1.67; 95% CI = 0.998–2.787]. Interestingly, for the rs2187668, 10% of CD group were found to be carrying the minor ‘T’ allele compared with the 3% of the healthy controls. This difference in minor allelic frequency is statistically significant [P=0.001; OR = 4.074; 95% CI = 1.615–10.273]. For rs7454108, there was no statistically significant difference between case and control groups (P-value > 0.5).<SEP>HLA-DQ haplotype results<SEP>The risk classification of the HLA-DQ genotypes (Table 4) is based on previous study from Saudi Arabia. In our study, tag SNP predicted homozygous HLA-DQ2.5 haplotype is significantly high in CD patients compared to healthy controls (10.89 vs 2.91%; p = 0.024). No heterozygous DQ2.5 (in combination with DQ8 or DQ2.2) carriers were predicted by the tag SNP combinations in either patient or control groups. The DQ8 heterozygous haplotypes (DQ8/DQ2.2 and DQ8/DQX) were highly frequent among CD patients (33.66%) with significant difference in DQ8/DQX haplotype between patients and control group, (32.67% vs 14.56% respectively, p = 0.014). Surprisingly, the homozygous DQ8 high risk haplotype was predicted by the tag SNPs more frequently in control groups (7.76%) than in patients (1.98%). However, the difference was not statistically significant. The predicted homozygous HLA-DQ2.2 haplotype was also frequent in control (5.82%) group than in CD patients (0.99%). A total of 29.13% controls and 24.75% CD patients were heterozygous for DQ2.2. A total of 74 (36.27%) individuals predicted to be lacking all the high risk HLA alleles and seen as the extremely low risk group (DQX).<SEP>Validation by sanger sequencing results<SEP>The sequencing analysis with sanger method showed the accuracy (100%) of Real-time PCR based tagSNPs approach in determining the HLA-DQ haplotype among randomly selected individuals for each SNP genotypes from both study groups (Figure 2).","Discussion<SEP>In the present study, we assessed the transferability of the Real-time PCR based TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay to accurately predict the HLA risk haplotypes associated with CD using four of the six tag SNPs in the Saudi population for the first time. Two HLA-tagSNPs (rs4713586 for DQ4 and rs4639334 for DQ7) were withdrawn from the present study because they were not polymorphic in the Saudi population (as per data from Saudi Human Genome Project -SHGP) and are not useful in tagging the targeted HLA haplotypes.<SEP>Our results shows that, in total 67.3% of Saudi CD patients were predicted to be the carriers of HLA CD-associated major risk alleles. We observed that Saudi individuals with homozygous HLA-DQ2.5 haplotype have a 4-fold higher risk to develop CD (OR = 4.074).This finding further confirms previous studies, which revealed a high risk associated with two copies of DQ2.5 among Europeans, Africans and Arabs (Table 5). A recent study among Saudi children has reported that the homozygous DQ2.5 was seen in more CD cases than healthy controls. In that study, presence of either HLA-DQ8 or HLA-DQ2.2 alone did not confer a risk of CD in the Saudi children; however, the combination of DQ2.5 with either DQ8 or DQ2.2 significantly increases the disease risk in general population. In contrast, no heterozygous DQ2.5 individuals have been predicted in this study. It can be explained by the low minor allele frequency for the predictive ‘T’ allele of the tagging rs2187668 SNP in this population (0.1%, 0.03%) in CD patients and control respectively, (Table 3).<SEP>Based on our HLA predictions and from previous studies, it is clear that the frequency of the HLA haplotypes in Arabs is not necessarily different from Europeans, but tagSNPs used for Caucasian population may not accurately predict the HLA genotype in this population. Significant differences in the patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the genomes of Saudis with the highest consanguineous marriages in the world might explain limited benefit of using the same tagSNPs to predict the heterozygote HLA-DQ2.5 allele. Several studies have shown that social factors such as the differences in consanguinity levels in populations is responsible for changes in genotype frequencies and results in the loss of heterozygosity with increasing homozygous genotypes. First cousin marriages among Arabs is high and the overall rates of consanguinity in Saudi Arabia ranges from 52.1% to 67.7% for many generations in the past. The frequency of consanguinity within our study is 30% in CD patients and 50% in controls.<SEP>We found that the most frequent predicted haplotype among Saudi CD patients was DQ8 (33.66%) in heterozygous form with a statistically significant P=0.014 for DQ8/DQX that increases the possible risk by more than 2 folds than the general population (OR = 2.36). Similar high frequency of HLA-DQ8 is seen in CD patients and Amerindian groups in Chile. Our findings showed a significant difference of predicted DQ8 among CD patients in comparison with other Arab population listed in Table 5, as well as other populations such as Cameroon, Italy, Hungary, United States, Finland and Japan with low frequency of heterozygotes. Furthermore, among healthy Saudi children fewer heterozygote DQ8/DQX and homozygous DQ8 haplotypes were reported. This finding suggests that the tag SNP rs7454108 in our study predicting excessively more DQ8 haplotype in the Saudi population than the other studies which used classical HLA genotyping methods.<SEP>Previous study reported about 17–20% of the general Saudi population carry HLA-DQ8, higher than in the Caucasians, 1–9%. These differences propose that variable combinations of HLA-DQ risk alleles among Saudi CD patients might confer different risk gradients for some HLA-DQ molecules compared to Caucasian CD patients. Although homozygous DQ8 haplotype is considered to be strongly CD-associated high risk molecule, surprisingly in our population, it was seen more frequently predicted in healthy controls (7.76%) than in CD patients (1.98%). Such differences, though not significant, were seen in Finnish, Hungarian and in some Arab population like Gaza strip.<SEP>The DQ2.2 haplotype is a low risk haplotype in CD patients in many countries. In our study, predicted homozygous DQ2.2 was more frequent in control group (5.82%) than in cases (0.99%). Although DQ2.2 is known to raise the risk for CD when associated with DQ2.5 or DQ8, it did not confer the high risk for CD in our population. This low frequency of predicted DQ2.2 among CD patients may suggest it plays a minor role in triggering the autoimmune process in our population. This finding was also supported by Al-Hussaini's study that DQ2.2 alone did not confer the risk for CD in the Saudi children. This might also suggest the protective role of DQ2.2 allele in the Saudi population, which requires to be tested in a larger study. High frequency of DQA1*02:01 allele that is associated with HLA-DQ2.2 haplotype in Santiago, Chile among control subjects suggests that they protect the population against the CD development. However, it was not possible in our study to determine whether predicted DQ2.2 individuals were carrying the DQA1*02:01 allele or not because of the low frequency of the predictive minor allele of tagSNPs in this population.<SEP>To date, most HLA data on CD patients studies has come from only few Arab countries, that too on a smaller sample size. In Table 5 our predicted HLA genotype frequency among CD patients and across different Arab countries shows some similarities as well as differences.<SEP>The present study has provided information on the predicted HLA genetic background of CD in Saudi population. The differences in HLA’s association with CD as observed in the present study population compared to non-Arab populations could be due to the different ethnic and cultural practices like first cousin marriages, which will in turn influence the polymorphic nature of SNPs. The present study also suggests that transferability of tagSNP approach in populations (like Arabs, African, Japanese and Chinese etc.) which have known differences in LD structure, still needs to be determined. Therefore, an immediate search for other tag SNPs with higher r2 value for disease association needs to be identified using population specific genetic database such as SHGP.<SEP>In conclusion, tagSNP typing is a reliable and easy alternate approach to rapidly genotype highly polymorphic HLA region. The present study represents the first investigation to test the applicability of tag SNPs to determine the HLA status of CD patients in Saudi population. Our findings reveal that, tag SNPs predicted homozygous DQ2.5 and heterozygous DQ8 haplotypes, of HLA are associated with CD development among Saudi patients. The findings of this study highlight that Caucasian specific tagSNPs would be of limited value to accurately predict CD specific HLA haplotypes in Saudi population. More than 32% of the CD patients were predicted to be not carrying the HLA risk alleles, highlighting the low predictive value for them in Saudi population. Large-scale HLA typing of Arab CD patients with different highly polymorphic population specific tagSNPs might reveal the accurate picture of HLA risk haplotypes in the disease diagnosis and treatment.",19318,"['FOODIN', 'FOODAL']"
25881102,"Background<SEP>Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women and the leading cause of gynaecological cancer-related death in the developed world. Despite optimization of debulking surgery and chemotherapy regimens, the overall 5-year survival in advanced stage disease is only 29%. The current standard first-line chemotherapy is a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. This treatment is associated with serious hematologic toxicities including grade 3–4 anemia (incidence 4.3-6.6%), grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia (4.7-12.9%), grade 3–4 neutropenia (37-89%), febrile neutropenia (2.3-8%) and grade 2–4 peripheral neuropathies (32-36%), resulting in dose reductions, treatment delays and representing an important physical, psychological and financial burden for the patient and society. Inter-individual differences in both toxicity and outcome related to treatment with paclitaxel-carboplatin are reported. A few patient-related risk factors for toxicity have been identified, such as elderly age (≥65 years), poor performance status and poor nutritional status. Furthermore, tumor-related factors including advanced stage at diagnosis, high-grade serous disease and residual tumor after debulking surgery are associated with poor survival. Genetic variability represents another potential factor explaining this inter-individual variability.<SEP>Genes related to drug transport, metabolism, detoxification and DNA repair could influence the cytotoxic effects associated with chemotherapy, including those involved in the transport (e.g., ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCG2, and SLCO1B3), hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, CYP1B1) and pharmacodynamics (e.g., MAPT, TUBB, TP53) of paclitaxel. Likewise, genes involved in detoxification (e.g., GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTM1) and base-excision DNA repair (e.g., ERCC1, ERCC2, XRCC1) have previously been linked with cytotoxicity of platinum agents. In particular, genetic variants in these genes, which generally are supposed to reduce the function of the affected gene, have been proposed to underlie the inter-individual differences in chemotherapy related hematologic and neurotoxicity. Likewise, variants in other genes, including SLC12A6, SERPINB2, PPARD and ICAM have been proposed to contribute to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity. Most studies identifying these candidate genes, however, have been performed in small study populations and were limited to testing only a few variants. Consequently, most of the reported associations have failed to be replicated in subsequent large-scale validation studies. Furthermore, most studies did not correlate genotypes with detailed clinical toxicity data.<SEP>In the current study, we therefore aimed to assess prior associations for 26 selected genetic variants in 18 genes, in a large cohort of 322 ovarian cancer patients treated with paclitaxel-carboplatin combination therapy or carboplatin mono-therapy of whom detailed clinical toxicity data were available.","Methods<SEP>Study population<SEP>All ovarian cancer patients presenting in participating hospitals of the Belgian and Luxembourg Gynaecological Oncology Group (BGOG) were recruited for this study. Collection of germ-line DNA and baseline patient characteristics were collected for each patient. Disease characteristics were recorded after histologic examination with registration of tumor stage according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification, residual disease after debulking surgery, measurement of tumor size on computed tomography (CT) scans and determination of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) before, during and after chemotherapy. Response to treatment and disease progression were evaluated based on radiologic examination according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Group (RECIST) criteria. Paclitaxel was administered at a starting dose of 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin at a starting area under the plasma concentration-versus time curve (AUC) of 5–7 mg/ml/min, with possible dose reductions after the occurrence of severe toxicity. During treatment, the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and colony stimulating factors (CSFs) was conform to uniform institutional standards; ESAs are given during treatment with chemotherapy in symptomatic patients with a hemoglobin level below 11 g/dl while CSFs are given if (1) neutropenia grade 4 (ANC <500/mm3) together with fever > 38°C or (2) neutropenia grade 4 (ANC < 500/mm3) during minimum 5 consecutive days. Toxicity during chemotherapy was systematically and routinely scored according to the Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Hematological toxicity was scored based on routinely performed weekly complete blood counts during treatment and before each cycle to determine the nadir of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia of each administered cycle, neurotoxicity was scored at each clinical-physical examination before each cycle. The scored toxicities for each patient together with all events of neutropenic fever and use of growth factors were systematically recorded in medical electronic records and for the purpose of the present study retrospectively collected by two independent investigators. The highest grade of toxicity over all courses within a patient was reported, if weekly performed blood counts were not available for each administered cycle or if neurotoxicity was not scored for every cycle, the patient was excluded from the analysis. The primary objective of this study was the correlation of genetic variation with the occurrence of hematologic toxicity or neurotoxicity in patients treated with first-line carboplatin with or without paclitaxel. Secondary objectives included the relation between genetic variation and the need for growth factors during treatment with chemotherapy, platinum-free interval (PFI) defined as the time between the last first-line platinum dose and progression, and overall survival (OS). Analyses for PFI and OS were performed in the population receiving a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel (n = 266) with exclusion of the more favorable prognostic population receiving carboplatin alone, based on clinical prognostic parameters such as FIGO stage, tumor grade and histological subtype. All included patients provided written informed consent before enrollment. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Leuven University Hospitals approved the study (ML6541), serving as central site with the authority to approve the study for all participating sites.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>We performed an extensive literature search before start of enrolment to identify genes associated with treatment outcome or toxicity after platinum and/or paclitaxel administration. We then selected common missense or synonymous mutations in these genes, as well as a number of SNPs that were located in the promoter region of these genes, but have previously been correlated with toxicity after platinum. In addition, we selected 5 additional SNPs previously associated with thalidomide-related neuropathy to investigate their role in repair mechanisms and inflammation in the peripheral nervous system leading to altered neurotoxicity, rather than having a thalidomide-specific contribution to correlated neurotoxicity. Genomic DNA was extracted from the leucocyte fraction of whole blood samples (Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit). All selected SNPs were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY technology (Sequenom Inc., CA, USA), as reported previously. Overall 26 SNPs in 18 genes (Table 1) were genotyped with an individual call rate >95% and an overall success rate >98.5%. We genotyped 15 duplicate samples revealing a genotype accuracy exceeding 99%.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>We calculated median values and inter-quartile ranges for all continuous variables, while frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. Genotype frequencies were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using a 1°-of-freedom χ2-test and considered significant at P < 0.05. Each of the variants were correlated with toxicity events (i.e., the primary objective) using binary logistic regression, while assuming an additive genotypic model. Per-allele odds ratios (OR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Regression analyses were performed without correction for covariates and after correction for relevant covariates, including age and BMI at the time of treatment, dose of carboplatin per cycle (AUC), number of administered cycles and treatment regimen (paclitaxel/carboplatin versus carboplatin alone). For anemia, an additional covariate was included, i.e., use of ESAs, whereas for neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, use of CSFs was included as an additional covariate. Secondary objectives, PFI and OS, were analyzed for 26 variants using Cox-regression analysis, adjusted for age at diagnosis only or fully adjusted for age at diagnosis, FIGO stage, tumor grade, tumor histology and residual disease after debulking surgery and PFS and OS estimates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Additionally, we investigated which of the variants could predict the need for ESAs or CSFs during treatment. All tests were two-sided and statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. The Bonferroni p-value threshold correcting for the multiple testing of 26 SNPs was p < 0.0019. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19 (SPSS for Windows, Rel. 19.0.0. 2010. Chicago, Illinois, USA: SPSS Inc.)","Results<SEP>Study population<SEP>Between January 2009 and December 2011 (pre-specified period of 2 years), we recruited 322 ovarian cancer patients treated with 3–6 cycles paclitaxel-carboplatin combination therapy (n = 266) or 3–6 cycles carboplatin mono-therapy (n = 56) (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Of all recruited patients, 99% was Caucasian (Table 2). Hematological toxicity was analyzed in 290 patients, after exclusion of patients for which weekly blood examinations were not available (n = 32). For neurotoxicity, 56 patients treated with carboplatin monotherapy were excluded since the incidence of sensory neuropathy was significantly lower in this population (p < 0.001). One patient with pre-existing sensory neuropathy before start of chemotherapy was additionally excluded, bringing the total number of patients eligible up to 265. For the secondary objectives, PFI and OS, all patients treated with paclitaxel-carboplatin (n = 266) were included. Patient, disease and toxicity characteristics are summarized in Table 2. Briefly, grade 3–4 anemia was present in 57 patients (19.7%), grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia in 57 patients (19.7%), grade 4 neutropenia in 202 patients (69.7%), whereas only 23 patients (7.9%) presented with grade 3–4 febrile neutropenia. In the group of patients selected for neurotoxicity analysis, 48 patients (18.1%) developed grade 2–3 sensory and none motor neuropathy following combination treatment with paclitaxel-carboplatin. Minor allele frequencies (MAF) were similar to those reported previously in Caucasians and adhered to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Allele frequencies of all genotyped SNPs are shown in Additional file 2: Table S1.<SEP>Association with anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and sensory neuropathy<SEP>Among the 290 patients eligible for the hematological toxicity analysis, we observed significant associations for 5 variants (Table 3). In particular, rs1128503 (ABCB1, C > T), rs12762549 (ABCC2, C > G), rs363717 (ABCA1, A > G) and rs11615 (ERCC1, T > C) were significantly associated with grade 3–4 anemia (p = 0.035, OR 1.58; p = 0.005, OR 0.55; p = 0.001, OR 1.31 and p = 0.024, OR = 1.58). After correction for relevant covariates (as explained in the statistical methods), these variants were still significantly associated with toxicity (p = 0.023, OR 1.71; p = 0.004, OR 0.51; p = 0.002, OR 2.08; and p = 0.031, OR 1.61 respectively). Another variant rs4986910 (CYP3A4, T > C) correlated with thrombocytopenia grade 3–4, before and after correction for relevant covariates (p = 0.012, OR 5.61 and p = 0.025, OR 4.99 respectively; Table 3). When correlating each of the variants with grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, we did not observe a significant association. Finally, we also correlated each of the variants to sensory neuropathy in the population that was eligible for neurotoxicity analyses, but failed to identify significant associations. None of the observed associations with hematologic toxicity survived correction for multiple testing.<SEP>Association between genetic variants and use of growth factors<SEP>The use of ESAs or CSFs was also correlated with each of the 26 variants to examine whether they could predict the need for an ESA or CSF during treatment with chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. After correction for relevant covariates, a significant correlation for rs2074087 (ABCC1, G > C) and the use of ESA was noticed (p = 0.011, OR 2.09, Table 4). After correction for covariates, CSF use was significantly correlated with rs2073337 (ABCC2, A > G), rs1695 (GSTP1, A > G) and rs1799793 (ERCC2, G > A) (p = 0.039, OR 0.60; p = 0.017, OR 0.55; and p = 0.042, OR 0.63 respectively). None of the observed associations with use of growth factors survived correction for multiple testing.<SEP>Effects of variants on PFI and OS<SEP>The median follow-up of all patients participating to the study was 2.5 years (95% CI = 2.2-2.8 years) with 157 events for progression (59%) and 84 events for OS (31.6%). Uncorrected P-values were calculated using Cox regression analysis either adjusted for age at diagnosis only or fully adjusted for age at diagnosis, FIGO stage, tumor grade, tumor histology and residual disease after debulking surgery. Only one variant, rs1799793 (ERCC2 G > A), was significantly correlated with PFI in both cases (p = 0.003, HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.57-0.89, p = 0.016, HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.60-0.95). In particular, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant advantage in PFI for GG carriers of rs1799793 compared to AA or GA carriers (p = 0.016; Figure 1). Variants rs12762549 (ABCC2 A > G) and rs6104 (SERPINB2 C > G) were significantly associated with PFI in the fully-adjusted model (p = 0.037 and p = 0.040, respectively), but these associations were not statistically significant in model adjusted for age only (p = 0.402 and p = 0.219, respectively). No significant correlations were found for OS.<SEP>None of the observed associations with platinum-free interval survived correction for multiple testing.","Discussion<SEP>We correlated paclitaxel- and carboplatin-induced toxicity with genetic variation in genes involved in pharmacokinetics of these chemotherapeutics or DNA repair, and observed various correlations supporting a role for these genes in mediating toxicity and therapy outcome. We observed that several variants correlated either with grade ≥3 anemia or thrombocytopenia, use of CSFs or ESAs, as well as the platinum-free interval (see Table 5 for an overview of all significant associations). These variants are located in genes that play an important role in transport (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC1, ABCA1) and hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) of paclitaxel and base-excision repair of platinum-induced DNA damage (ERCC1, ERCC2), thus confirming a role for these genes in mediating side-effects and efficacy of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Indeed, ATP-binding cassette transporters, which are expressed on the cell-membrane surface, play an important role in the transport of taxanes, whereas cytochrome P450 proteins, CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, catalyze the oxidative metabolism of taxanes. Furthermore, ERCC1 and ERCC2 are subunits of the endonuclease complex that plays an essential role in DNA repair by removing platinum-induced intra-strand cross-links.<SEP>Most other studies assessing similar correlations have been performed in smaller populations, and typically evaluated only few variants. Our study evaluates a more systematically-selected panel of 26 variants in a large population of ovarian cancer patients, of which 290 were evaluable for hematologic toxicity and 265 for neurotoxicity. Another strength of our study is the availability of more detailed clinical toxicity data compared to previous pharmacogenetic association studies in ovarian cancer, allowing us to correlate specific entities of the hematologic toxicity spectrum, whereas other studies mostly grouped all hematologic > grade 3 toxicities into a single group or focused on the occurrence of neutropenia alone.<SEP>Several of the previously published studies investigating the role of these variants with respect to toxicity and chemotherapy outcome confirmed the observations made in the present study. With respect to the ABC transporters, the rs1128503 (1236C > T) synonymous variant in ABCB1 has been associated with multidrug resistance in multiple studies, and with decreased docetaxel clearance in particular, for homozygous carriers of the variant T-allele in 92 patients. However, its association with severe anemia observed in our study has not been reported before. The rs1045642 (3435C > T) synonymous variant in ABCB1 increased 3′p-hydroxy-paclitaxel metabolites in 23 ovarian cancer patients carrying the T-allele. Vice versa, in a study of 26 patients, a significant greater percent decrease in absolute neutrophil count at nadir was reported for patients homozygous for the T-allele, Bergmann also reported a more pronounced neutrophil decrease in patients carrying the T-allele in 92 ovarian cancer patients carrying the T-allele.. In our study, we failed to observe an association with grade ≥3 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia. Possibly, this is due to the fact that we analyzed grade ≥3 neutropenia whilst previous studies used absolute neutrophil decrease. A Japanese study demonstrated that carriers of the variant allele for rs12762549 (ABCC2,101620771 C > G) had an increased risk to develop docetaxel-induced leukopenia/neutropenia in 84 patients. In the current study, no such association was found, but we did find a significant association with anemia and PFI, thereby confirming the potential importance of this variant in mediating taxane transport. Notably, another variant in this gene, rs2073337 (1668 + 148A > G), was significantly correlated with CSF use. For rs363717 (1896 A > G) in ABCA1, which was selected based on its association with thalidomide-related peripheral neuropathy, we did not observe a significant association with sensory neurotoxicity. We observed, however, a significant association of this variant with severe anemia (p = 0.001), suggesting that ABCA1 is involved in the transport and metabolism of platinum or carboplatin, similar to its role in the transport of cholesterol.<SEP>With respect to the CYP genes, low CYP3A4 enzyme activity increased the conversion of paclitaxel towards its metabolite, while heterozygous patients for CYP2C8*3 had a lower clearance of paclitaxel, suggesting the role of those genes in paclitaxel pharmacokinetics in a study of 38 patients. In 93 patients with ovarian cancer, Bergmann et al. observed an 11% reduction in paclitaxel clearance in carriers of the rs10509681 (1196A > G) variant G-allele in CYP2C8, whereas Leskelä et al. observed a correlation between neurotoxicity and these CYP2C8 and CYP3A5 variants in a study consisting of 118 patients. In the present study, we failed however, to observe such associations. Another large study in ovarian cancer also failed to observe correlations with neurotoxicity for these variants in docetaxel or paclitaxel-treated patients. We did observe, however, a significant association between rs4986910 (1331 T > C) in CYP3A4 and thrombocytopenia. Homozygous carriers of the rs1695 (313A > G) variant G-allele in GSTP1 have been associated with neuropathy in 90 patients receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. This association was not confirmed in our study, although a correlation with febrile neutropenia and CSF use was observed.<SEP>Finally, with respect to the excision repair genes, previous studies reported a correlation between severe neutropenia and the rs1799793 (934G > A) variant A-allele in ERCC2 in 104 ovarian cancer patients receiving a cisplatin-cyclophosphamide regimen. In the current study, no correlation with severe neutropenia was described, although the rs1799793 (934G > A) variant A-allele did correlate significantly with CSF use during treatment. Additionally, we observed an improved PFI for rs1799793 (934G > A) GG-carriers. The largest study to date exploring the association between 27 selected variants and ovarian cancer survival, which was performed by the ovarian cancer association consortium (OCAC) in >10,000 cases, rs1799793 (934G > A) was not tested. Nevertheless, in the high-grade serous sub-population of this large study, a significant correlation was found with another variant in ERCC2 (rs50872 A > G) and outcome, confirming the potential importance of ERCC2 in mediating chemotherapy outcome. Unfortunately, rs50872 was not linked with rs1799793 (934G > A) (r2 = 0.06), indicating that these variants represent different association signals with ERCC2.<SEP>In summary, we observed the strongest associations between variants in ABC-transporters and anemia. The mechanism explaining why altered transport of cytotoxic chemotherapy affects erythropoiesis rather than granulopoiesis or thrombopoiesis is not yet understood. Possibly, these variants alter intracellular concentrations of the transported cytotoxic drug in a cell type-specific manner. Another possibility is that some cell types might be more sensitive to specific changes in the concentration of certain metabolites. On the other hand, it is also possible that the effect on erythropoiesis is caused by a specific role of the affected gene during erythropoiesis. For example, a prominent role for ABCB6 during erythropoiesis as a mitochondrial porphyrin transporter essential for heme biosynthesis, has been established.<SEP>It is a limitation of the current study that the group for hematologic toxicity analysis included both single agent carboplatin as paclitaxel/carboplatin combination therapy although it is known that both regimens have a slightly different hematologic toxicity profile with more thrombocytopenia in carboplatin monotherapy compared to combination regimens, in our cohort the rate of grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia was 28% for carboplatin versus 18% for combination therapy. Apart from the fact that both regimens are included for hematologic analysis, this cohort is relatively homogenous including only data on first-line treatment in ovarian cancer patients with a uniform ethnicity (99% Caucasians), high number of optimal debulked patients and relatively uniform number of administered cycles of chemotherapy. To further reduce the problem of heterogeneity, pharmacogenetic research on prospective clinical trials including large populations of uniformly treated patients is warranted.<SEP>It should be noted that the candidate-gene approach employed so far selecting drug-related genes derived from platinum/taxane pharmacology only allows the analysis with candidate genes known to be involved in chemotherapy metabolism, transport or DNA repair. To discover novel genetic markers, other approaches such as whole-genome association studies or targeted re-sequencing of strong candidate genes to identify rare genetic variants, could be applied. In addition, other drug- or toxicity -related candidate genes relevant for paclitaxel-carboplatin treatment in ovarian cancer (such as GSTA-1, MAD1L1, OPRM1, TRPV1, …) could be selected based on pharmacogenetic knowledge bases such as pharmGKB (www.pharmgkb.org).",23759,['FOODIN']
28205048,"Introduction<SEP>Establishing the correct and timely diagnosis in a patient with elevated urinary excretion of orotic acid is key to effective treatment. The differential diagnosis of orotic aciduria (OA) is broad, and includes several treatable disorders, like urea cycle defects (especially ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency) and uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) deficiency (Lichter-Konecki et al). Additionally, OA can be seen in mitochondrial disorders, lysinuric protein intolerance, liver disease, and has been reported in Rett syndrome, malignancies, as a side effect of certain medications and in trauma victims (Jeevanandam et al).<SEP>UMPS-deficiency (or hereditary OA, MIM #258900) is a rare inborn error of metabolism (reviewed in Balasubramaniam et al). UMPS (EC 4.1.1.23), encoded by the UMPS gene, is a bifunctional protein in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis. In the first reaction, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase) converts orotate to orotidine monophosphate. In the second step, orotidine decarboxylase (OMPdecase) decarboxylates orotidine monophosphate to uridine monophosphate. Patients with UMPS-deficiency reported to date presented with megaloblastic anemia in the first months of life. If untreated this disorder can lead to neutropenia, failure to thrive, growth retardation, sparse hair and nail growth, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. Gross excretion of orotic acid may also cause crystalluria in later life (Bailey; Grohmann et al).<SEP>The UMPS gene consists of six exons, and encodes a protein that is 480 amino acids in length (Suchi et al). In mammals and yeast, the active enzyme is a dimer (Wittmann et al). The first N-terminal 214 amino acids comprise OPRTase, while the C-terminal 258 amino acids comprise OMPdecase (Suttle et al). Biallelic missense mutations which lead to amino acid substitutions are a presumed common cause of disease; biochemical studies in cell lines from UMPS-deficient patients have demonstrated decreased steady-state levels of the enzyme, impaired substrate binding, and reduced catalytic efficiency (Winkler and Suttle; Perry and Jones; Suchi et al).<SEP>Here we discuss the clinical relevance of heterozygosity for UMPS variants and mild OA by presenting a case series of 11 index cases and 18 healthy family members.","Individuals and methods<SEP> Metabolic screening included complete blood count, blood gas analysis, serum glucose, electrolytes and lactate, plasma ammonia and amino acids, urinary organic acids, purines and pyrimidines and was (repetitively) performed using standard methods.<SEP> Enzyme activity in erythrocytes OPRTase and OMPdecase activities were determined in lysates of fresh erythrocytes as previously described (Krungkrai et al)<SEP>Genetic investigations<SEP> Exome sequencing of the individuals III-6, III-7, IV-5, and IV-6 from pedigree 2, I8, I10, and I11 was performed as previously described (Wortmann et al). Bidirectional Sanger sequencing of all six UMPS (NM_000373.3 (hg19)) coding exons plus ∼20 bp of flanking non-coding intronic DNA was performed in individuals I2-I11 and family members on genomic DNA using standard methods (primer sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request). SNP array analysis (Affymetrix SNP 6.0) of individuals I1, I4, and I8 as well as karyotyping of I4 was performed by standard methods. Whole genome copy number screening was also performed for individual I8 (CytoSure ISCA v2 4x180k array, Oxford Gene Technology). Gene-specific deletion/duplication testing of UMPS of individuals I4, I6, and I7 was performed via high density gene-centric array CGH (Prevention Genetics, details available upon request). Gene panel sequencing (GPS) of individual I12 was performed using a targeted panel of genes causing inborn errors of metabolism (details available upon request).<SEP>Molecular modeling of UMPS variants<SEP>The models presented are based on PDB-entries 2WNS and 3BGG (www.rcsb.org/pdb/) for the OPRTase and OMPdecase domains of human UMPS, respectively. Figure 2 was prepared using PyMOL 1.6.0.0 (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8 Schrödinger, LLC).<SEP>Clinical cohort<SEP>The 11 index individuals (I1….I13) were referred for various signs and symptoms as detailed below; all were shown to have OA (summarized in Table 1). Additionally, one pedigree (Ped2) is described in which the index case did not have OA, but several family members. Of note, none of the investigated index patients nor their family members had relevant anemia or neutropenia, hyperammonemia, growth delay or failure to thrive. <SEP> Individual I1, an Australian female born at term, presented neonatally with a clinical picture of encephalitis. Metabolic screening showed mild transient hyperammonemia and persistent OA without any other biochemical abnormalities. Apneic episodes resolved over 5 days and she was discharged on day 9. Brain MRI showed isolated partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. She had feeding difficulties as an infant and dysplastic hips. Repetitive metabolic screening showed no abnormalities other than consistent isolated OA. Currently, at the age of 6 years, she has some learning difficulties and is educated in a mainstream school with additional support. Both parents (M1, F1) had no relevant medical complaints (NRMC); urine of parents was not tested. Pedigree P2 (Fig. 1a): The parents of this “index” male (IV:6) with intellectual disability and infantile seizures were seeking genetic advice. They agreed to participate in a study for establishing reference values for urinary purines and pyrimidines measurements. This lead to detection of OA in the Italian father (III:6) and the older brother (IV:5) of this “index” who both had NRMC. The “index” himself and his Croatian mother (III:7) did not show OA. OPRTase activities were within the normal range for all four family members (father 0.037 ± 0.008, mother 0.312 ± 0.087, older son 0.265 ± 0.079, “index” 0.059 ± 0.008; reference range 0.288 ± 0.073 nmol/mg protein/h). OMPdecase activities were in the heterozygous range in the father (0.073 ± 0.011) and older son (0.096 ± 0.008), and normal in the mother (0.395 ± 0.091) and the “index” (0.424 ± 0.098; reference range 0.409 ± 0.094 nmol/mg protein/h). Finally, a total of 12 family members were shown to have OA and another 14 did not have OA. Beside the “index” (without OA), NRMC were reported for the other family members. Individual I3 (data extracted from Suchi et al; Imaeda et al), a Japanese male of unreported age, was evaluated for intellectual disability. He and his healthy mother (M3) were both reported to have OA. In both individuals, the OPRTase and OMPdecase enzymes measured in red blood cells were reported to be reduced but in the heterozygous range (details not given). No details of the father were provided. Individual I4 presented at the age of 7 months with developmental delay. At the age of 16 months, this Caucasian male had his first myoclonic seizures; a brain MRI at the same age was unremarkable. Mild OA was noted, but further metabolic screening was unremarkable. Both parents (M4, F4) had NRMC. Individual I5, a 6 year old Hispanic male, presented as a premature infant (30 weeks of gestation) with transient hyperammonemia. Urine organic acid profile revealed persistent mild OA. Development has been normal, except for a mild learning disability (WISC-V: average global IQ, lower score for working memory and risc score for inattention/impulsivity). His mother (M5) also showed mild OA, but his father (F5) did not. Both parents had NRMC. Individual I6, a 20 month old Caucasian male, presented with failure to thrive, multiple food allergies, and speech delay. Metabolic screening was unremarkable except for persistent OA. The mother (M6) has mild cognitive impairment and a moderate degree of OA; a healthy male maternal half-sibling (S6) did not exhibit OA. The father was not available for evaluation. Individual I7, a 10 month old Caucasian male, presented with dysmorphic features, hypotonia, developmental delay, and macrocephaly. Past medical history was notable for resuscitation at birth after an unremarkable pregnancy. His history further included strabismus, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, and recurrent abdominal pain, as well as left talipes equinovarus. Urinary organic acid analysis revealed repeatedly mild OA, once with concomitant slightly elevations of glycolic acid, oxalic acid and uracil. Urinary purine and pyrimidine analysis was initially normal, however, repeated testing showed an elevated orotic acid. At 3 years of age the patient was healthy and making developmental gains. The patient’s healthy brother (S7) also showed mild OA. Neither parent (M7, F7) had any relevant medical complaints. Individual I8, a 1 year old Dutch female, presented with global developmental delay, generalized joint hypermobility and persistent OA. Over time, her development showed a satisfactory catch-up development, and at 5 years of age she is attending regular school. She still has joint hypermobility. The mother (M8) had NRMC and no OA. The biological father was an anonymous sperm donor. Individual I9 2.5 year old French-Canadian female, presented with global developmental delay. Her past medical history was otherwise unremarkable. The metabolic screening was consistently normal with exception of OA. The family history was unremarkable and parents (M9, F9) had NRMC. Individual I10, a 1 year old Dutch male, presented with generalized muscular hypotonia, joint hypermobility, and weakness of the ocular, oral, and limb girdle musculature. A muscle biopsy showed fiber type disproportion. Metabolic screening revealed isolated OA with no other abnormalities. At last evaluation (age 7 years), he showed an increase in muscle strength and improved motor development. The parents are healthy, the mother (M10) exhibited mild OA; urine analysis of the father (F10) was unremarkable. Individual I11, a 16 year old Dutch male with autism and poorly controlled type I diabetes mellitus, presented with liver failure. Elevated transaminases and lactate levels were evident on admission. The diagnosis of Mauriac syndrome (secondary hepatic glycogenosis in poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type I) was made and he fully recovered with improved diabetes control. Metabolic screening showed isolated OA. Both parents are healthy, the father (F11) exhibited mild OA; urine analysis of the mother (M11) was unremarkable. <SEP> Individual I12, the second child of healthy unrelated Polish parents, was brought to attention at birth. His older brother was born prematurely and died neonatally due to hyperammonaemia of unknown cause. This sibling was treated prospectively from birth with a low protein diet, sodium benzoate, and arginine supplements. There were no clinical concerns regarding this child, however urinary organic acid analysis showed persistent mild OA. Around 6 months of age his diet was liberalized and medication was ceased. At last evaluation (age 3 years) he was neuro-developmentally normal. Both parents (M12, F 12) have normal urine organic acids and NRMC.","Results<SEP>Genetic results (Table 2, Figs. 1 and 2)<SEP>SNP array of I1 showed a de novo 6.4 Mb deletion on chromosome 3 (chr3:121233326–127618464) containing more than 40 RefSeq genes, including UMPS, making it likely to be contributing to the patient’s phenotype. It did not contain any genes known to cause agenesis of the corpus callosum when deleted. In four individuals (I4, I7, I10, I11) and four healthy family members (M7, S7, M10, F11), three different heterozygous alterations UMPS were found which were predicted to lead to a premature stop and thereby loss of normal protein function via protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In I4 c.302delA (p.Lys101Argfs*9) was found; karyotyping, SNP array, and gene-specific deletion/duplication testing of UMPS via high-density gene-centric array CGH did not reveal abnormalities. No family members were tested. I7 harbored the c.385G>T (p.Gly129*) variant in UMPS, which was maternally inherited and also found in the healthy brother (S7). In both I10 and I11 (coming from the same region of the Netherlands), a c.889G>T (p.Glu297*) variant was found (maternally inherited in I10; paternally in I11). In six individuals (I3, I5, I6, I8, I9, I12) and 16 healthy family members (M3, M5, M6, M7, n = 12 from pedigree 2) seven different heterozygous missense alterations were detected. In pedigree 2, 12 family members (Fig. 1) tested positive for the c.224C>A (p.Pro75His) variant. In five cases the variant was derived maternally, in four cases paternally and in three cases it is unknown. In I3 and his healthy mother M3 (7,13) two variants c.286A>G (p.Arg96Gly) and c.1285G>C (p.Gly429Arg) in UMPS were found, therefore likely to be on the same allele. In I5 the variant c.310G>A (Gly104Arg) was detected, I6 harbored c.689G>A (p.Arg230His), in I7 c.688C>T (p.Arg230Cys) was found, both were maternally inherited. In I9 c.857T>A (p.Ile286Asn) and in I11 c.451G>A (p.Val151Met) were detected; both parents were not tested. The missense alterations found were predicted to be pathogenic by different software programs (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutationTaster). All amino acids affected were well-conserved from H. sapiens (down) to D. melanogaster or to C. elegans. I6 was also heterozygous for a second maternally inherited undocumented variant, c.360A>G (p.Leu120Leu), a synonymous change. In individuals 4, 6, and 7, additionally copy number variations in UMPS were excluded. Most of the variants were not listed in the Exac browser; for those listed, the allele frequencies were below 0.001 (Table 2).<SEP>Molecular modeling of UMPS variants<SEP>The effects of missense mutations in the UMPS gene on the protein conformation are illustrated in Fig. 2 and described in the legend of the figure.","Discussion<SEP>Establishing the correct and timely diagnosis in a patient with OA is key to effective treatment. The more common urea cycle disorders require a protein-restricted diet, prevention of catabolic situations, and treatment with ammonia-detoxificating medication (Lichter-Konecki et al 2016). The very rare UMPS-deficiency has been treated successfully with uridine compounds (Becroft and Phillips; Alvarado et al; Bensen et al). In addition, the correct diagnosis has a substantial impact on the counseling of the patient and the family, including discussion of recurrence risk.<SEP>The literature does not provide us with a reliable estimate of the incidence of OA due to UMPS-deficiency nor the prevalence of UMPS-mutation carriers. A single survey (Rogers et al) described the results of screening over 1000 “mentally retarded” patients for organic acidurias. Of nine subjects with OA, two were found to have decreased OPRTase and OMPdecase enzyme activities, which were also documented in a parent of each child. Early reports of children with OA without megaloblastic anemia, abnormal growth, or developmental delay (Tubergen et al) may well represent UMPS-mutation carriers, as they were reported in the pre-molecular age.<SEP>Due to lack of clinical information, present-day databases do not shed light on the incidence of OA either. There are over 70 entries in the ClinVar/dbVar databases with genomic deletions that include UMPS, but only seven are described as “pathogenic.” Those deletions range from 4 to 94 Mb in size, and include from 45 to 707 genes. No clinical or biochemical information is available. There are 48 missense variants listed in Ensembl for which additional information is available, but only the three mutations reported by (Suchi et al) were identified as pathogenic. These three mutations are also the only pathogenic mutations among the 150 missense variants listed in the ExAC browser as well as the 155 missense variants listed in dbSNP. Since many of the variants listed may be benign, it is clear that these databases are failing to support clinicians.<SEP>As demonstrated in the 11 individuals described, OA is a prominent and challenging biomarker that can mislead the diagnostic team of metabolic physicians and laboratory staff, potentially delay arrival at the correct diagnosis, increase diagnostic costs, and generate unpleasant and often unnecessary investigations in children (e.g., repetitive ammonia and OA testing, allopurinol loading test in I8, OTC gene sequencing etc.). The individuals reported herein all had urinary OA levels (elevated 2.5–14.3 times of upper reference limit) that were relatively constant unlike in OTC deficiency, in which levels vary greatly (Lichter-Konecki et al 2016) and are usually much lower than in classical UMPS-deficiency. Furthermore, the individuals in our cohort had non-informative plasma amino acid profiles and no other abnormal laboratory findings, especially no relevant hyperammonemia nor hematological abnormalities. The UMPS-mutations found in these individuals occurred in both domains of the enzyme (OPRTase and OMPdecase). Mutations in both parts of the enzyme led to similar mildly increased urinary orotic acid concentrations.<SEP>Metabolic screening in the individuals described (Table 1) was pursued most often due to delayed development (n = 6), which is a common practice (van Karnebeek et al). Other indications were muscular hypotonia, suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder, neonatal encephalitis, liver failure, and unexplained neonatal death of a sibling with hyperammonemia. In all cases the clinical signs and symptoms were non-specific and together with the metabolic screening results were not suggestive of a known disorder associated with OA. Additionally, OA was also present in 18 family members harboring the same genetic variants as the probands. Only one carrier parent (M8) did not exhibit OA.<SEP>A previous study identified several individuals with benign, persistent OA and heterozygosity for an UMPS defect was suggested as one of several possible reasons for these observations (Carpenter et al). Our findings confirm that heterozygous alterations in UMPS can indeed lead to mild and isolated OA without clinical consequences.<SEP>Balasubramaniam et al suggested that calculation of the orotate/orotidine ratio may reflect the effect of mutations on the relative activities of ORPTase and OMPdecase. We did not see a correlation in this ratio in our series of patients. Urinary orotidine levels were available in six patients in our cohort. Four of these patients harbored mutations leading to premature termination of translation, which should impact both enzymatic activities. The other two patients harbored different missense mutations in the same codon (230) of UMPS (which lies in the OMPdecase coding region). These are predicted to interfere with electrostatic interactions within the OMPdecase region but not necessarily alter dimerization. There were overlapping orotate/orotidine ratios between these two groups of patients, hence precluding any biochemical correlation.<SEP>Therefore, we conclude that heterozygous alterations in UMPS can lead to mild and isolated OA without clinical consequences. The prevalent presentation of developmental delay in our patient population may be due to ascertainment bias. Five (I3, I4, I5, I7, I8, I10) of six individuals with some degree of developmental delay or intellectual disability had maternally derived mutations. This may suggest that in utero exposure to elevated levels of orotic acid and/or decreased pools of pyrimidines may impact neurologic development. This theory, however, is not corroborated by the fact that the siblings S6 and S7, as well as five individuals from pedigree 2, with maternally derived mutations do not have any relevant medical complaints.<SEP>In summary, heterozygous rare variants in UMPS should be considered in all patients with isolated mild OA before pursuing further diagnostic studies. Alternatively, measuring urinary orotic acid levels in parents is a rapid and inexpensive means of determining clinical significance of OA in children.",20119,['FOODIN']
33294886,"Cancer is the world’s second leading cause of death: it was responsible for 9.6 million deaths in 2018. In the United States, 1,806,590 new cases of cancer and 606,520 cancer deaths are estimated to occur in 2020. Cancer also exerts a powerful influence over the social and economic circumstances of the affected people, and it has become a major problem for the healthcare systems of many countries.<SEP>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer and the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in developed countries. Worldwide, CRC is the second most frequently identified cancer in men and the third most frequently identified cancer in women. In men, it is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths and in women it is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths. It is projected that approximately 147,950 people will be diagnosed with CRC and 53,200 will die from this disease in 2020.<SEP>In Saudi Arabia, CRC is the most common cancer among men (19.6% of 2405 new cases in 2018) and the third most common cancer among women (9.5% of 1159 new cases in 2018). Since 2002, CRC has been recognized as the most commonly occurring cancer in Saudi Arabia; the highest rates of the incidence of CRC have been identified in Riyadh.<SEP>Although the exact cause of CRC is currently unknown, some factors are associated with an increased risk of developing the disease: advanced age, lifestyle, diet, alcohol intake, lack of physical activity, smoking, family history of CRC and colon polyps, presence of colon polyps, exposure to radiation, and inherited genetic disorders. These risk factors may play a role at the genetic level. Therefore, it is necessary to identify risk factors affecting the progression of CRC that may have an effective role in its diagnosis and treatment.<SEP>It is necessary to improve the diagnosis and treatment of CRC by identifying new biomarkers related to its clinicopathological characteristics. Several genetic variants involved in CRC pathogenesis have been identified through the development of sophisticated molecular techniques for genome analysis.<SEP>Currently, more than 300 cytokines have been identified and CRC has been linked to both systemic and local changes in the cytokine profiles. Genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), sometimes lead to changes in the transcription, production, and functional activity of cytokines.<SEP>Interleukin (IL) -8, -10, -22, and -27, and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1), have been recognized as critical factors involved in CRC development. Additionally, relationships between polymorphisms and cytokine levels, including those of TGFβ1 and IL-10, -22, and -27, have been reported in CRC patients. However, the effects of these cytokine gene polymorphisms on CRC patients in Saudi Arabia are understudied. The present study aims to explore how CRC patients in Saudi Arabia are affected by the presence of several specific cytokine polymorphisms: IL-8 (rs4073 T/A), IL-10 (rs1800896 A/G), IL-22 (rs1179251 C/G and rs2227485 C/T), IL-27 (rs17855750 T/G), and TGFß1 (rs1800469 C/T).","Methods<SEP>This study was carried out in King Khaled University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The case-control study was carried out between July 2019 and January 2020. We used the PubMed Modular for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website to search for relevant publications. This study included 70 Saudi patients with CRC from the out-patient department in King Khaled University Hospital. All patients in the study were previously diagnosed with CRC by colonoscopy.<SEP>Inclusion criteria of case group are patients who need partial colectomy of both genders and ≥18 years old. Exclusion criteria of case group are ≤18 years old, All patients had no previous diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. The control group consisted of 70 healthy Saudi subjects from the outpatient department at the King Khaled University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia who is undergoing colonoscopy as preventive measure and who had a normal result. Participants were selected consecutively. The study performed was according to the principles of Helsinki Declaration. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Ethical Committee of King Saud University (Ref.No.19/0830/IRB).

Using a NanoDrop ND-2000c Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) for assay quantification of the extracted DNA.<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>Genotyping assays were performed using Assays-on-Demand TaqMan®SNP genotyping assays, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Applied Biosystems, USA). Interlukin-8 (rs4073 T/A, assay ID: C_11748116_10), IL-10 (rs1800896 A/G, assay ID: C_1747360_10), IL-22 (rs1179251 C/G, assay ID: C_3125110_10) and IL-22 (rs2227485 C/T, assay ID: C_15955719_20), IL-27 (rs17855750 T/G, assay ID: C_25926696_10), and TGFß1 (rs1800469 C/T, assay ID: C_8708473_10). The TaqMan genotyping assay mix contained 2 primers for the sequence of interest and 2 TaqMan® Minor Groove Binder (MGB) probes for alleles detecting. The TaqMan® MGB Probes involved of target-specific oligonucleotides with VIC® dye (linked to the 5´ end of the Allele 1 probe) and 6FAM™ dye (linked to the 5´ end of the allele 2 probe). The presence of 2 probe pairs in each reaction allowed genotyping of the 2 possible variant alleles at the SNP site in a DNA target sequence. The presence or absence of an SNP determined by genotyping assay based on probed-associated dye fluorescence change. Assays were run at a final volume of 10 µl involving 5.5 µl of TaqMan® Genotyping MasterMix, 0.26 µl TaqMan®SNP Genotyping Assay mix containing primers and probes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Applied Biosystems, USA), and 50 ng/µl DNA template. The thermocycling protocol contained an initial AmpliTaq Gold, UP enzyme activation step for 10 min at 95°C and 40 cycles for 15 sec at 95°C, and 40 cycles for 60 sec at 60°C.

Allele frequency showed significant decreased of the G allele to CC with p=0.022, and this was also confirmed by an OR of 0.47. Having one or more copy of allele (G) conferred an decrease in CRC risk (p=0.062, OR=0.13). The homozygous for the variant GG was decreased among patients with CRC (OR=0.06) but did not reach significance.<SEP>The IL-22 (rs2227485: C/T) polymorphism in the promoter region was assessed.

Clear tendency for a decrease in the CT genotype was observed in the CRC group (45.7% vs. 54.3%, OR=0.15, p=0.009). The TT genotype was significantly decreased in the patients (OR= 0.16, p=0.014). When considering the recessive model (CT + TT versus CC), high significant association was observed between CC genotype and occurrence of CRC (p=0.009). T allele was slightly lower in the CRC patients compared to the control group but failed to reach significance (p=0.161, OR=0.68).","Discussion<SEP>This study examined the relationship between some candidate polymorphism and CRC in a Saudi population following a case control study based on a group of CRC patients and confirmed unrelated healthy group at a 1:1 ratio.

The presence of TT, TA, and AA genotypes were confirmed. The results indicated no noticeable change in allele frequency in the CRC and control groups. However, there were no significant differences in allele frequency between the CRC and control groups.<SEP>Meta-analysis of IL-8 (rs4073 T/A) polymorphism association with risk of prostate cancer are in agreement with the results of the present study. Their study did not identify any significant association between the IL-8 (rs4073) TA and AA genotypes.<SEP>In contrast with our study, Gonzalez-Hormazabal et al reported that the polymorphism in the IL-8 gene was associated significantly with gastric cancer risk. The (rows) AA genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of CRC when compared with the rs4073 TT genotype. Additionally, for allele frequencies, compared with the wild type allele T of IL-8 -251, the variant allele A showed significant increases for CRC susceptibility risk. Similarly, Liu et al investigated the association of the IL-8 -251 T/A and +781 C/T polymorphisms and glioma risk. They found patients with glioma had a significantly higher frequency of IL-8 -251 AA genotype. We suggests that further analyses of the IL-8 genotypes should be performed.<SEP>In our study, we also examined the association between the IL-10-1082 A/G (rs1800896) polymorphism and CRC. The results showed that the AA genotype vs AG+GG of the investigated IL-10 polymorphism increased the risk of CRC in the studied population. Also, a significant association was observed wherein those with heterozygous variant genotype (AG) had a lower risk of developing CRC (OR=0.44, p=0.027). Additionally, we found that G allele was associated with a decreased risk of CRC, but this result was not statistically significant (OR=0.68, p=0.160). The higher producing G allele could be a protective factor in CRC susceptibility. These findings are in agreement with those of Gulubova et al, who studied a Caucasian population. A previous study involving a Kashmiri population aimed to evaluate the association of IL-10 -592C/A and IL-10 -1082A/G promoter SNPs with CRC risk. This study found that the association between the IL-10 -592C/A promoter SNP and a decreased risk of CRC is significant, but found no significant association between IL-10-1082A/G SNP and the risk of CRC. Basavaraju et al, did not identify any statistically significant associations for the IL10-1082 A/G and IL10-592 A/C SNP risk of CRC in a population of Northeast Scotland.<SEP>The strong association that we observed in patients with CRC suggests that the IL-10 (rs1800896 A/G) polymorphism indicates G allele possible protective role against CRC.<SEP>Polymorphisms in the IL-22 gene have been suggested as risk factors for cancers. In the present study, we investigated 2 SNPs for the IL-22 (rs1179251 C/G) and (rs2227485: C/T) polymorphism in Saudi patients with CRC and controls. The results showed that the polymorphism in IL-22 (rs1179251 C/G) Variant G allele was significantly associated with decreased risk of CRC (p=0.022) that confirmed by OR=0.47. Similarly, for variant GG homozygote, such an association was observed but not significance (OR=0.06).<SEP>Increasing evidence indicates that the IL-22 rs1179251 C/G polymorphism is associated with many other cancers. It has been demonstrated that the rs1179251 C/G polymorphism of IL-22 is associated with gastric cancer and might influence its progression. A meta-analysis of 3 case control studies involving 799 cancer cases and 1129 controls investigated the rs1179251 polymorphism. The results showed that the rs1179251 C/G polymorphism was correlated with an increased risk of developing cancer.<SEP>However, we did not identify any association between IL-22 (rs2227485 C/T) and the risk of CRC. Comparison of the results for patients and controls showed no significant differences (p=0.708) in frequencies of C and T alleles of IL-22 rs2227485 C/T.<SEP>In the present study, the results were in accordance with those found in the meta-analysis investigating the association between IL-22 (rs2227485 C/T) polymorphism and cancer risk. Those results indicated that IL-22 (rs2227485 C/T) polymorphisms were not associated with a risk of cancer. We noted that data from previous studies in different ethnic populations are inconsistent with our results. Lin et al found that CRC cases had a significantly frequency of the IL-22 (rs2227485) TT genotype and T allele compared to the controls when stratifying by the differentiation of CRC in a Chinese population. This suggests that the distribution of the IL-22 gene frequencies vary between different ethnic groups. Therefore, ethnic differences may be a plausible explanation for the absence of an association between rs2227485 C/T polymorphisms with CRC risk compared to previous reports. Our results indicated that the IL-22 (rs1179251 C/G) polymorphism was considered as a protective for CRC susceptibility in a Saudi population, while the (rs2227485 C/T) polymorphism was not associated with CRC risk.<SEP>Interleukin-27 shown notable antitumor effects in different models of cancer. Thus, IL-27 has been suggested as a new potential agent in cancer immunotherapy studies. Therefore, we suggest that SNPs of IL-27 may impact IL-27 anti-cancer activity, which might increase the risk of developing CRC.<SEP>We explored the rs17855750 T/G polymorphism located 2905 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the IL-27 gene, and CRC risk. The results suggest that the IL-27 rs17855750 T/G polymorphism is associated with CRC risk.<SEP>However, the IL-27 rs17855750 T/G polymorphism has been identified, and a relationship between this gene polymorphism and a risk of developing endometrial cancer, thyroid carcinomas, cervical cancer, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been reported. Additionally, a meta-analysis aiming to determine the effects of IL-27 polymorphisms (rs153109, rs17855750, and rs181206) on cancer predisposition showed that the IL-27 rs17855750 T/G polymorphism is significantly associated with increased susceptibility to cancer.<SEP>We found that non significant differences in the GG genotype (OR=0.10, p=0.160) and significant differences in G allele (p=0.005, OR=0.20) frequencies were observed between CRC patients and controls, indicating that the G alleles may act as protection against CRC.<SEP>In contrast with our study, a meta-analysis reported that the polymorphism in the IL-27 gene was associated significantly with CRC risk in Chinese population. The difference with our results may be due to ethnic variability in the allelic distribution of Il-27 polymorphism, which suggests that further analyses of the IL-27 genotypes should be performed.<SEP>Transforming growth factor-β1 It is known to affect many marks of cancer that contain angiogenesis, tissue invasion, immune suppression, metastasis and immune suppression. We found that the carriers of the CT genotype had a lower risk of developing CRC (OR=0.15, p=0.009), also the carriers of the TT genotype (OR=0.16, p=0.014). Our analyses showed a strong association with having one or more copy of the T allele and decrease in predisposition to CRC. However, we also found that significantly high frequency of the TGF-β1 (rs1800469) CC genotype vs TT+TC with CRC risk (OR=0.16, p=0.009).<SEP>These results are consistent with those of a case-control study that found a significantly increased risk of advanced CRC cancer for the TGF-β1 (rs1800469) CC genotype while T allele was protective against development and progression of CRC in a Bulgarian population.<SEP>Transforming growth factor-β have important role in promoting progression of tumor. TGF-β1 gene mRNA expression in CRC tissue relates with tumor progression and metastasis. We speculate that the TGF-β1 (rs1800469) CC genotype carriers could a high level of TGF-β expression, which increased CRC susceptibility compared to its counterpart.<SEP>Study limitations<SEP>The limitation of this study were the relatively small sampled size and conduct only in one city.<SEP>In conclusion, statistically significant reduction of CRC risk was found for carriers of the IL-10 (rs1800896 A/G) AG genotype, IL-22 (rs1179251 C/G) G allele, IL-27 (rs17855750T/G) G allele and TGFß1 (rs1800469 C/T) CT and TT genotype. Also, we found significant associations between the cytokine polymorphisms of IL-10 (rs1800896 A/G) AA genotype and TGFß1 (rs1800469 C/T) CC genotype and increase CRC risk. We did not identify significant associations between the cytokine polymorphisms of IL-8 (rs4073 T/A) and IL-22 (rs2227485 C/T) and CRC risk. However, additional studies are needed to determine the associations of IL-8, -10, -22, and -27 and TGF-ß1 polymorphisms with CRC risk under several genetic association models in a Saudi population.

21966427,"Introduction<SEP>Environmental insults support an immune milieu that promotes allergic asthma. Epithelial cells, the first targets of inhaled environmental insults such as pollution or tobacco smoke, produce cytokines that modify T cell and inflammatory cell responses. Genetic variants of these cytokines may contribute to the susceptibility to asthma. Furthermore, epithelial cell-derived cytokines may be candidate genes that participate in gene-environmental interactions.<SEP>Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has been called a “master switch” of allergic inflammation at the epithelial cell and dendritic cell interface. A member of the IL-7 family of cytokines, TSLP induces maturation of myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) that support Th2 polarization and promotes maintenance of the Th2 memory response. TSLP-treated mDC induce an inflammatory Th2 response that is associated with elevated IL-5, IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-α but low IL-10. Regulatory T cell function is also downregulated by TLSP, allowing a Th2 permissive microenvironment.<SEP>TSLP is expressed by human epithelial cells and is increased in asthmatic airways. We have reported that diesel exhaust particles (DEP) upregulate TSLP expression in human bronchial epithelial cells in response to oxidative stress and that this epithelial-cell derived TSLP induces the functional maturation and Th2 polarization of dendritic cells (DC). Tobacco smoke extract also upregulates TSLP expression in the murine lung and in smooth muscle. Recently, TNF- α, IL-4, IL-13, rhinovirus, and dsRNA have also been described to upregulate TSLP in human bronchial epithelial cells. Airway epithelial cell expression of TSLP is both necessary and sufficient for the development of airway inflammation in murine models of antigen-induced asthma. These findings reinforce the potential importance of TSLP and its genetic components in environmental-associated asthma.<SEP>The gene for TSLP is located on human chromosome 5q22, near the gene cluster encoding Th-2 cytokines. A sex stratified analysis recently showed that a TSLP polymorphism (rs2289276) was associated with cockroach-specific IgE in Costa Rican females. In a large Canadian population, a SNP (rs1837253) 5.7 kb upstream of the TSLP transcription start site was associated with asthma and the association was replicated in a large consortium study. An additional SNP (rs10062929) of the TSLP gene has been identified in association with eosinophilic esophagitis.<SEP>Urban populations in the United States have high morbidity and mortality from asthma and are highly exposed to ambient air pollutants such as diesel exhaust, environmental tobacco smoke, and indoor allergens such as those from cockroach. These populations are often of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, and thus complex populations for genetic studies. Because of the importance of TSLP as a target for environmental-associated asthma, we examined the association of genetic variants of TSLP with asthma in an admixed urban community using genetic ancestral informative markers to control for population substructure. Furthermore, we validated the findings using independent populations.","Materials and Methods<SEP>Study Population<SEP>Asthmatics and healthy controls were identified from the New York University Bellevue Asthma Registry (NYUBAR) in New York City. This registry was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the New York University School of Medicine and all cases and controls signed informed consent. Cases were referred to the registry by the Bellevue Hospital Center Asthma Clinic and local clinics. Controls were referred by asthma cases and by enlisting individuals directly from the community and from other programs within Bellevue Hospital Center. Subjects were excluded if they were less than 18 years old, were current smokers or had a history of >10 pack-year (p-y) tobacco use, had unstable cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, lung disease other than asthma, or neuromuscular disease. Questionnaires and evaluations were completed for all individuals and participants were ascertained with a diagnosis of asthma by a definition modified from the Collaborative Study on Genetics of Asthma. Because most cases were on medication, bronchial hyperresponsiveness with methacholine challenge testing was not performed. The diagnosis was further confirmed using the published algorithm of Enright et al.. To assemble the case-control study, cases and controls were selected to be genetically unrelated with a case to control ratio of approximately 2 to 1, resulting in 387 unrelated asthmatics and 212 healthy controls.<SEP>A replication population included 6 population-based cohorts that are part of the Analysis in Population-based Cohorts of Asthma Traits (APCAT) consortium. Asthma diagnosis in these populations was based on physician diagnosed asthma. Individuals with a diagnosis of COPD, chronic bronchitis, or other lung diseases were excluded from the analysis. Cohorts included: the Helsinki Birth Cohort (HBC: 123 cases, 1533 controls), Health 2000 (H2000: 153 cases, 1841 controls), Finrisk (160 cases, 1705 controls) (includes Finrisk 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007), the North Finnish Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC66: 364 cases, 3502 controls), Laseri (119 cases, 1844 controls), and the Framingham Heart Study (FH: 797 cases, 6463 controls) for a total of 1716 cases and 16888 controls. All individuals in the studies provided informed consent and all studies were conducted with the approval of the local ethics committees or institutional review boards.<SEP>Allergy testing and Spirometry<SEP>Measurements of total serum IgE (total IgE) and allergen-specific IgE for allergens considered significant for the Northeastern United States were performed in a commercial laboratory for the NYUBAR cohort (Pharmacia ImmunoCAP assay; Quest Diagnostics; Teterboro, NJ). An allergen-specific IgE level >0.35 kilo-international units (kIU)/L was considered positive. Pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society guidelines and normal values were obtained from Hankinson et al.. Individuals were on a stable dose of medications for one month prior to study but medications were withheld for 6 hours prior to testing.<SEP>Candidate SNP selection and genotyping<SEP>Contiguous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TSLP region on chromosome 5q were identified in the International Haplotype (HapMap) project (International Haplotype Consortium 2003) using data from the European Americans (CEU) and the West African population (YRI). The program Tagger was used to select representative SNPs from the TSLP gene with high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (minor allele frequency >5% and r2≥0.8). Genotyping was performed at the Robert S. Boas Center for Genomics and Human genetics on an Illumina BeadStation 500G Golden Gate custom panel using unamplified DNA extracted from blood. Genotyping reproducibility was verified with duplicates. Ten SNPs in TSLP were successfully genotyped with call rate greater than 99% and minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 1%. The genotypic information and the Hardy-Weinberg analysis results are summarized in Table S1.<SEP>Genome-wide genotyping, quality control measures, and imputation in the replication cohorts (APCAT) has been described previously. Briefly, each cohort was genotyped on a platform containing >500,000 SNPs, and, after quality control the genotypes at >2.2 million genotypes were imputed using the HapMap CEU panel as a reference.<SEP>Ancestral informative markers (AIMs) with the maximal absolute difference in allele frequency between ancestral populations were used to differentiate continental origins most likely to be represented in the NYUBAR population including diverse Hispanic ancestry. We genotyped 213 AIMs to adjust for population admixture in associate tests.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>Genotype frequencies of each SNP were tested for the concordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using Pearson's chi-square test in the overall population and then in the control population using R package HardyWeinberg (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HardyWeinberg/index.html). Two approaches, the principal component analysis (PCA) method and the Bayesian STRUCTURE method (version 2.2.3) were implemented using 213 AIMs to adjust for population stratification. Either the first five principal component scores from the PCA approach or the posterior probabilities from the STRUCTURE approach were included in the association analysis as ancestry covariates to adjust for population stratification.<SEP>Single SNP association tests with asthma susceptibility assuming an additive allelic effect were performed using the logistic regression, including covariates of age, BMI, income, education and ancestry covariates. Subgroup analyses stratified by smoking status into ex-smokers and never-smokers were also conducted. To test whether multiple genetic variants from the TSLP gene were associated with asthma, haplotypes were reconstructed using the EM algorithm and the haplotype-specific association were tested using the score test approach based on the generalized linear model using R package haplo.stats (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/haplo.stats/index.html). All analyses were performed using R 2.9.1.<SEP>For the APCAT cohorts, each study separately performed a single marker association analysis assuming an additive allelic model for the imputed data set consisting of ∼2.2 million SNPs. SNPs with low imputation quality (r2<0.3 for MACH) were removed from all studies. Each cohort was stratified into current-smokers, ex-smokers and never-smokers, and the association analysis was further performed within each stratum. The analysis was performed using the logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender and the first ten principal components, and accounting for uncertainty at imputed genotypes. The GEE logistic regression test of the GWAF package in R (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GWAF/) was used to correct for familial relatedness in FHS. Test statistics from individual studies were corrected for inflation using genomic control, and then combined using meta-analysis by combining the regression coefficients and standard errors from each study, implemented in METAL (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Metal/index.html).","Results<SEP>Patient characteristics<SEP>A total of 387 unrelated asthmatic patients and 212 unrelated healthy controls were included in the analysis of the NYUBAR population. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. A majority of the cases and controls were women and were never-smokers. The average age of the cases was slightly but significantly higher than that of the control group (40.1 vs. 36.1, p = 0.0015) and the average BMI of the cases was significantly higher than the control group (29.9 vs. 27.2, p<0.0001). The self-reported race/ethnicity also differed between cases and controls (p = 0.01). Consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, lung function differed significantly between cases and controls, with reduced % of predicted FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC in cases compared to controls. Cases had a significantly higher total IgE and more cases were atopic.<SEP>Population stratification<SEP>The first and second principal components from the PCA using 213 AIMs were plotted in Figure 1 with self-reported race/ethnicity information. The first principal component scores showed good separation between the self-reported non-Hispanic white group and the self-reported non-Hispanic black group, while the principal component scores of self-reported Hispanic group were in-between. The first five principal components counted for more than 80% of variability of the ancestry markers. The STRUCTURE method estimates the posterior probability that each subject belongs to each underlying population for each individual. When included as covariates to adjust population stratification in the association tests, the STRUCTURE method resulted in similar results to the PCA method and thus the STRUCTURE results are not reported.<SEP>TSLP and asthma susceptibility<SEP>The results of association analysis of asthma and TSLP SNPs are summarized in Table 2. One SNP (rs1898671) was nominally associated with asthma susceptibility in the overall population after adjusting for covariates and population stratification (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.09–2.05, p = 0.01). However, the risk of asthma was increased for this SNP when analyzed in the subgroup of ex-smokers, (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.04–30.83, p = 0.04). In the subgroup of never-smokers, SNP rs1898671 did not show significant association with the risk of asthma (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.93–1.94, p = 0.11).<SEP>Because of the suggestion of an association of SNP rs1898671 with asthma, we examined whether the association of this SNP with asthma susceptibility could be replicated in the APCAT cohorts that combined 6 cohorts with 1716 asthma cases and 16888 controls. Analysis of this large cohort revealed consistent results with a positive association between rs1898671 and asthma (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07–1.23, p = 0.0003). When stratified by smoking history, the replication cohort validated the finding in the NYU cohort that the SNP affected risk in ex-smokers (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08–1.34, p = 0.003), whereas no significant association was found in never-smokers.<SEP>TSLP haplotype analysis<SEP>Reconstructed haplotypes with estimated frequencies of greater than 5% are listed in Table 3 and the estimated haplotype-specific OR with respect to the reference haplotype group (defined as the group with highest frequency) and p-values are also reported. The second most frequent haplotype (GAGGGCAAAG) had an estimated frequency of 24% and showed a significant increased risk with asthma after adjusting age, BMI and population stratification (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.10–2.27, p = 0.01).","Discussion<SEP>Asthma is prevalent in urban populations of mixed ancestry with high rates of morbidity and mortality in these populations. However, few genetic studies have used diverse urban populations for study because of the complexities of analysis resulting from admixture and mixed ancestry. Moreover, the interaction with environmental exposures may modify asthma risk. TSLP is an epithelial cell-derived cytokine in the IL-7 family that is mechanistically implicated with asthma in numerous human and animal models. Both ambient pollutants and tobacco smoke, common urban environmental exposures, upregulate TSLP. We demonstrated that a SNP variant in TSLP is associated with clinical asthma in an urban population when adjusting for ancestry as well as additional covariates. Examination of an additional large population-based consortium study supported the association between this SNP and clinical asthma. Associations were found to be stronger in those with tobacco exposure. Haplotype analysis of TSLP also revealed an elevated risk of asthma associated with one haplotype. In summary, these data suggest that genetic variants in TSLP may influence asthma risk in complex populations with an environmental interaction.<SEP>Our primary population of study was a diverse population and population stratification can influence genetic variation. Indeed, we identified a difference in self-reported race/ethnicity between our asthma cases and controls, suggesting that ancestral differences needed to be accounted for. Moreover a large number of our cases and controls self-reported as Hispanic, a group with complex ancestral history. Thus we accounted for ancestry in our evaluation using SNPs that previously have been associated with similar populations and our results remained consistent even after incorporating ancestry in our evaluation using either of two separate analyses (PCA or STRUCTURE).<SEP>The rs1898671 SNP was significant for clinical asthma after adjusting for ancestry and covariates. We did not compensate for multiple testing in these analyses as we considered them discovery testing to be replicated using independent large cohorts. The persistence of significance even after adjustment reinforced the potential importance of this SNP or its associated SNPs. Furthermore, the association of SNP rs1898671 with asthma was replicated in an independent large population-based cohort.<SEP>The strength of association of rs1898671 increased when analyzed according to smoking status. The NYUBAR excluded individuals with >10 p-y tobacco use and so examination was limited to those with a less than 10 p-y history of tobacco use. Despite this, the association was strongest in the subgroup with a history of tobacco use. The association with asthma was also stronger in the subgroup with tobacco use in the replication population. This finding suggests a gene-environment interaction effect and is consistent with the studies showing a relationship with TSLP expression and pollutants or tobacco smoke.<SEP>The rs1898671 variant is located in an intron and no functional effect of the variant is known. However, we used a tagging algorithm to identify tagSNPs and as such rs1898671 may be in linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs with potential function variation. In the HapMap CEU sample, rs1898671 is in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.91) with rs1043828, which was strongly associated with asthma in the meta-analysis by the GABRIEL consortium (p = 3.1×10−6). Although the result did not reach genome-wide significance in GABRIEL study, the combination of our results with the published data now strongly suggest that rs1898671 or a variant in LD with rs1898671 influences the susceptibility to asthma. Stratification by smoking status was not available for rs1043828 in the GABRIEL data, so we cannot test whether their association is also stronger in individuals with a history of smoking. We did not perform genotyping for SNP rs1837253 in the NYUBAR cohort but were able to examine the association of this SNP from APCAT cohorts, since this SNP was highlighted by He et al. and the GABRIEL study as possibly associated with severe asthma. The SNP rs1837253 was not significantly associated with asthma risk in the overall population (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.99–1.17, p = 0.1), but did show a nominal association with asthma in Ex-smokers (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.07–1.37, p = 0.01). But this SNP is only in weak LD with rs1898671 (r2<0.2), and thus likely represents a separate signal from the associations we observe. Furthermore, the rs1898671 SNP has recently been reported in association with increased risk of eosinophilic esophagitis when comparing to the combined allergic and non-allergic controls. Our exploratory analysis also showed a positive association of this SNP with elevated circulating eosinophils but the result was not statistically significant (data not shown). The possibility exists that this SNP was not detected in other large population studies because of the tobacco interaction.<SEP>In summary, we now suggest the association of a TSLP variant and asthma in an admixed population after adjusting for confounders and ancestry. We replicate the finding in an independent population and suggest an interaction with tobacco use. The risk for asthma was associated with a specific haplotype of TSLP involving SNP rs1898671. These data suggest that variants in TSLP may participate in gene and environment interactions associated with asthma susceptibility.",19514,['FOODAL']
29456405,"Core tip: Knowledge of the pathophysiology of Crohn’s disease (CD) is vital in the development of new diagnosis techniques and treatments for the disease. Our study involves the investigation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 and 22 (PTPN2/22) and their effects on susceptibility to mycobacteria species and the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our data demonstrates that SNPs in PTPN2/22 lead to less negative regulation in T-cells and increase susceptibility to mycobacteria, thus increasing inflammation and apoptosis in intestinal tissues. Personalized treatment could be accomplished by genetic testing and antibiotic treatment for mycobacteria in CD patients.<SEP>INTRODUCTION<SEP>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play a significant role in the pathogenic process of inflammatory autoimmune disorders. These SNPs affect several immunity genes, leading to an overactive immune system. Consequently, self-tolerance mechanisms fail in a variety of immune cells including T-cells, B-cells, and antigen-presenting cells. Along with these genetic defects, environmental factors such as bacterial and viral infections have also been associated with inflammatory autoimmune disorders. These factors trigger phenotypical response to occur in the defected immune cells. Some of these diseases, such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), and Crohn’s Disease (CD), share some of the same genetic SNPs with each other. An example of regulatory immune genes that these diseases share SNPs in are in the protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) and type 22 (PTPN22) genes. PTPN2/22 are genes found more frequently in T-cells, where they encode enzymatic phosphatase proteins (PTPN2/22) that negatively regulate the T-cell receptor (TCR). PTPN2 and its protein product (PTPN2) are also found in a majority of epithelial cell types including synovial joint tissue, β-cells, and intestinal tissues, where they control apoptosis and chemokine production. SNPs in PTPN2/22 have been hypothesize to cause a dysregulation of the immune system that is brought upon by overactive T-cells and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production due to lack of negative regulation.<SEP>With a majority of inflammatory autoimmune disorders sharing the same genetic pre-dispositions, it is possible that the pathogenesis of these disorders could also share some of the same common environmental triggers with each other as well (Figure 1). Recent studies have shown that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) infections have been associated with a variety of different inflammatory disorders including CD. Mycobacterial infections causes problems in these inflammatory autoimmune patients when the patient is genetically predisposed, causing the immune system to become dysregulated. This dysregulation will lead to high amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, production of autoantibodies, and high amounts of apoptosis occurring in a variety of cell types, thus leading to chronic inflammation.<SEP>In addition to sharing the same genetic predispositions and environmental triggers, many inflammatory autoimmune disorders share the same medical treatments as well. For instance, anti-TNF-α therapeutics such as adalimumab and infliximab are used for RA and CD. However, anti-TNF-α medications along with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, and other disease-modifying drugs cause several side effects. These side effects include osteoporosis, hypertension, GI intolerance, autoantibodies against medications, and increased risk of developing opportunistic infections, especially mycobacterial infections. With the undesirable side effects of these medications, it is important that inflammatory autoimmune disorders pathogeneses is thoroughly examined in order to develop more accurate detection of disease and to develop more personal treatment with little side effects.<SEP>In this study, we focus on the pathogenesis of CD, where we explore the effect of both the genetic predisposition of SNPs in PTPN2/22 and the environmental trigger of MAP infection. We hypothesize that SNPs in PTPN2/22 lead to loss of negative regulation in T-cells and, with a MAP infection, increases production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ. This leads to an increase inflammation and apoptosis in the intestinal tissues of CD patients.","MATERIALS AND METHODS<SEP>Clinical samples<SEP>A total of 133 consented CD subjects and healthy controls donated two to three 4.0 mL K2-EDTA coded blood tubes for us in this study. The study was approved by the University of Central Florida Institutional Review Board #IRB00001138. Each subject completed and signed a written consent form before samples were collected. Healthy control subjects completed a survey that question if said subjects had any medical abnormality (CD, T1D, RA or “other diseases”). No healthy control subjects had any type of medical conditions to the best of their knowledge. The severities of the CD subjects’ symptoms were scored from moderate to severe symptoms. The average age of CD subjects was 39.6 ± 14.3 with a gender ratio of 48.6% male and 51.4% female. The average age of healthy controls was 30.7 ± 13.4 with a gender ratio of 41.9% male and 58.1% female subjects. Table 1 lists age, gender and other demographic information for all CD subjects in this study. From the blood tubes, the following procedures were done to the samples: PTPN2/22 genotyping, gene expression profiling, MAP IS900 nested PCR (nPCR) detection, and T-cell proliferation assays.<SEP>PTPN2/22 genotyping<SEP>TaqMan™ SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems™) were used to genotype nine SNPs in PTPN2/22 from the isolated DNA from subjects’ blood samples. Samples and reagents were sent to the University of Florida Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research Department (Gainesville, FL) to perform genotyping assays. Out of the nine SNPs, four SNPs were specific to PTPN2 that includes rs1893217, rs2542151, rs7234029, rs478582 along with five SNPs that were specific to PTPN22 that includes rs2476601, rs2488457, rs33996649, rs34209542, rs2476599. Briefly, DNA was extracted from whole blood samples using QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen™) following manufacturer’s protocol. TaqMan™ genotyping assays for PTPN2/22 SNPs were performed on DNA samples following manufacturer protocol (Applied Biosystems™). Briefly, DNA samples and the TaqMan™ SNP Genotyping Assays mixtures (primers with Vic and Fam fluorophore attachment) were transferred into a 384-well plate along with 2 × TaqMan™ Master Mix and 20 × Assay Working Stock in each well. Plates were treated to an RT-PCR protocol consisting of 95 °C for 10 min for 1 cycle, 92 °C for 15 s and 58 °C for 1 min for 50 cycles. The plates were then read for VIC (551 nm) and FAM (517 nm) fluorescence, where VIC or FAM alone determined allele 1 or allele 2 in the samples, while VIC and FAM together determined heterozygous for each allele in the samples.<SEP>PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ gene expression<SEP>Gene expression of PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ was performed by converting RNA from subjects’ whole blood samples to cDNA and performing RT-PCR. RNA from the subjects’ blood samples were isolated from peripheral leukocytes via TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) per manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 1.0 mL of whole blood from subjects’ samples were transferred into a microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 3000 rpm for 15 min until the leukocytes formed a buffy coat layer, which was then transferred to new 2.0 mL RNase free microcentrifuge tubes. Tubes containing the leukocytes from subjects’ samples were then suspended in 1.0 mL of TRIzol®, where the tubes were incubated and gently rocked for 15 min at room temperature. Next, 0.2 mL of chloroform was then mixed in each tube and then incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Tubes were then centrifuged at 11400 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, where afterwards the upper aqueous phase containing RNA was transferred to new 2.0 mL RNase free microcentrifuge tubes. Next, 0.5 mL of 100% isopropanol was added to the tubes containing subjects’ RNA samples, where they were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Tubes were then centrifuged at 11400 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, where afterwards the RNA pellets were washed in 1 mL of 75% ethanol. Washed RNA pellets were then centrifuged for 8700 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and then air-dried until fully dried. Dried RNA pellets were then suspended in 20 μL of RNase free H2O and boiled to 60 °C for 10 min.<SEP>Conversion of RNA to cDNA was done following the iScript™ Reverse Transcription (Bio-Rad®) manufacturer’s instruction. RNA concentration from each subjects’ samples were first quantified via NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific®) and then diluted to 600 ng of total RNA. Next, diluted RNA samples were then added to PCR reaction tubes that contained 0.2 mL PCR reaction, 4 μL of iScript™ Reverse Transcription (Bio-Rad®), and up to 20 μL RNase free H2O. The PCR reaction tubes then underwent a PCR protocol consisting of 5 min at 25 °C, 20 min at 46 °C and 1 min at 95 °C, where the final concentration of cDNA for each sample was 30 ng/μL.<SEP>For the RT-PCR reaction, 1 μL of cDNA (30 ng) was added to a 96-well microamp plates along with 10 μL of Fast SYBR Green Mastermix (ThermoFisher Scientific®), 1 μL of PrimePCR SYBR Green Assay mix (Bio-Rad®) specific to target gene, and 8 μL of sterile H2O. For the positive control for the RT-PCR reactions, the 18s RNA gene was the target to determine if the reaction work and to obtain baseline CT readings. The oligonucleotide primers for the 18s RNA gene that were used for the RT-PCR reaction was the following: forward primer: 5’-GTA ACC CGT TGA ACC CCA TT-3’ and reverse primer: 5’-CCA TCC AAT CGG TAG TAG CG-3’. RT-PCR reactions were performed using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems®), where relative gene expression levels were calculated using ∆CT (sample gene CT reading-18s RNA gene CT baseline reading) and using the equation (2(∆CT) × 1000).<SEP>Detection of MAP IS900 DNA<SEP>MAP IS900 DNA was detected via nPCR from cultured peripheral leukocytes that were isolated from the subjects’ blood samples as described previously. Briefly, subjects’ blood sample tubes were centrifuged for 3000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, where the buffy coat layer containing peripheral leukocytes was present and transferred to new sterile 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes. The peripheral leukocytes were then washed twice by adding double the volume of red cell lysis buffer (ammonium chloride solution, G-Biosciences®) to each tube and incubating/gently rocking for 10 min and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant from each subjects’ samples were then removed and the isolated peripheral leukocyte pellets were re-suspended in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. The isolated pellets were then cultured in BD Bactec™ MGIT™ Para-TB medium (Becton, Dickinson and Company©) tubes supplemented with 800 uL of Bactec™ MGIT™ Para-TB Supplement (Becton, Dickinson and Company©) for six months at 37 °C in a BD Bactec™MGIT™ 320 Analyzer (Becton, Dickinson and Company©).<SEP>After six months of culturing, subjects’ cultured samples underwent DNA extraction by using a modified DNAzol® (ThermoFisher Scientific®) extraction protocol as follows. A 2.0 mL sampling of culture from each subjects’ tubes were obtained and pipetted into new sterile 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes. The tubes were then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 2.5 min, where afterwards the supernatant was discarded from the tubes and the culture pellets were saved. The subjects’ culture pellet tubes were then mixed with 1.0 mL DNAzol® reagent and then mixed with 400 μL of 100% isopropanol. The tubes were then incubated for 15 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 6 min, where afterwards the supernatant was discarded, leaving a DNA pellet. DNA pellets from the subjects’ samples were then washed once with 500 μL DNAzol® reagent and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatant was then discarded from the tubes and the DNA pellets were then washed again with 1.0 mL of 75% ethanol, where they were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. DNA pellets were then dried after supernatant was removed via speedvac for 5 min. The dried DNA pellets were then dissolved in 50 μL of TE buffer.<SEP>MAP IS900 DNA was then detected in each subjects’ samples by the use of our nPCR protocol and nucleotide primers as described previously. Subjects were considered to have MAP presence when a 298 bp band on a 2% agarose gel is shown after nPCR reaction. The positive MAP DNA control that was used originated from our laboratory cultured clinical strain UCF4, which was isolated from a CD patient. The negative controls for each PCR step that was used contained all PCR reagents except for the DNA template used in the reactions.<SEP>T-cell isolation and proliferation assay<SEP>T-cells were fully isolated from subjects’ whole blood samples by the use of RosetteSep™ Human T-cell Enrichment Cocktail (StemCell™ Technology) as per manufacture’s instruction. For the T-cell isolation and proliferation assays, the entire T-cell populations were examined in this study and were not segregated by subpopulations. Briefly, 50 μL/mL of RosetteSep™ Human T-cell Enrichment Cocktail was added to each subjects’ whole blood samples and was incubated at 20 min at room temperature. Samples were then diluted with equal volumes of PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich®) and mixed gently. The mixtures from each subjects’ samples were then layered on top of a Lymphoprep™ (Axis-Shield®) density medium in a separated tube and centrifuged for 20 min at 2500 rpm at room temperature. Separated T-cells from each subjects’ samples were then found on top of the density medium layer and were collected into new sterile 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes and washed twice with PBS with 2% FBS.<SEP>Subjects’ isolated T-cells were then plated on a 96-well plate, where T-cell proliferation assays were done using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling proliferation ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals®) as described previously. To stimulate the subjects’ isolated T-cells, phytohematoagglutunin (PHA) was used as a positive control mitogen. The test mitogen used in the T-cell proliferation assays was purified protein derivative-like (PPD-like) from UCF4 MAP bacterial cultures that were prepared by purification of supernatant from sonicated protein extract. Briefly, 1 × 105 isolated T-cells from each subjects’ samples were transferred in triplicates to 96-well plates and incubated in the following conditions: RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich®) only, PHA (10 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich®) or MAP PPD-like (5 μg/mL) along with respected subjects’ plasma. The plates were then incubated for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and then labeled with 20 μL/well of BrdU and incubated again for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The T-cell proliferation assay was done through the Roche BrdU proliferation ELISA kit as described previously. Relative T-cell proliferation levels of samples were compared to the control group (isolated T-cells in RPMI only) by examining the fold change in the absorbance reading of each well at 450 nm.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>Samples were analyzed for significance using unpaired, two-tailed t-tests; unpaired, two-tailed z-scores; and odds ratio. GraphPad Prism 7 was used for statistical analysis and creation of graphs. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.","RESULTS<SEP>PTPN2/22 SNP allele frequency in CD<SEP>Allele frequency of the nine SNPs examined in PTPN2/22 found in both CD subjects and healthy controls are shown in Figure 2. All genotyped samples were found in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Out of the four SNPs found in PTPN2 (rs1893217, rs2542151, rs7234029, and rs478582), rs478582 was significant in the CD, where heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles when examined together were detected in 57/69 (82.6%) in CD compared to 36/59 (61.0%) healthy controls (OR = 3.03, 95%CI: 1.35-6.84, P-values < 0.05, Figure 2A). Specifically, the heterozygous (TC) alleles were detected in 38/69 (55.1%) CD compared to the 28/59 (47.5%) of healthy controls, while homozygous (CC) alleles were detected in 19/69 (27.5%) CD compared to 8/59 (13.6%) healthy controls. SNPs rs1893217, rs2542151, and rs7234029 were found to be not significant in CD compared to the healthy controls. Out of the five SNPs specific to PTPN22 (rs2476601, rs2488457, rs33996649, rs34209542, and rs2476599), none of SNPs were considered significant in CD compared to the healthy controls (Figure 2B). However, since PTPN22:rs2476601 is found significantly in various inflammatory autoimmune diseases, we continued to investigate the SNP in more detail along with PTPN2:rs478582. For PTPN22:rs2476601, CD with either heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles were detected in 11/70 (15.7%) subjects, while 4/62 (6.45%) was detected in healthy controls (OR = 2.7, 95%CI: 0.81-8.98, P-values > 0.05). Specifically, the heterozygous (GA) alleles were detected in 10/70 (14.3%) CD compared to the 4/62 (6.45%) of healthy controls, while homozygous (AA) alleles were rare in all samples.<SEP>For confirmation that CD subjects were significant in having SNP alleles for PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601, determination of haplotype combinations were done (Figure 2C). Examination of the following haplotype combinations between PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 were examined: T-G, C-G, T-A, and C-A. The T-G haplotype (major/major) was found more significantly in the healthy controls (21/59 = 35.6%) than in CD (10/69 = 14.5%, P-values < 0.05). The C-G haplotype (heterozygous or minor/major) and the C-A (heterozygous or minor/heterozygous or minor) were found more in CD (48/69 = 69.6%; 9/69 = 13.0%, respectively) than in healthy controls (34/59 = 57.6%; 2/59 = 3.39%, respectively). The C-A haplotype was found more significantly in CD than the healthy controls (P-values < 0.05).<SEP>Relationship of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on expression of PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ in CD<SEP>The average relative gene expression (2(-∆CT) × 1000) of PTPN2, regardless of SNPs, in CD was significantly lower (5.27 ± 2.68, n = 38) than in healthy controls (10.5 ± 6.95, n = 30, P-values < 0.05, Figure 3A). Similarly, the average relative gene expression of PTPN22, regardless of SNPs, was also significantly lower in CD (1.76 ± 1.12, n = 38) than in healthy controls (3.24 ± 1.84, n = 30, P-values < 0.05, Figure 3B). The evaluation of the effect of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on expression of PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ was determined.<SEP>For subjects with either heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582, regardless of disease, expression of PTPN2 did not change when compared to the normal (TT) subjects.

The average relative gene expression in CD with heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582 was significantly lower (5.34 ± 2.77, n = 31) compared to 10.2 ± 7.15 (n = 21) in healthy controls with similar SNPs (P-values < 0.05). Specifically, when examining subjects with heterozygous (TC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582, CD average relative gene expression was 5.22 ± 2.57 (n = 22), which was significantly lower than the healthy controls with heterozygous (TC) alleles (10.5 ± 7.15, n = 17, P-values < 0.05). When examining subjects with homozygous (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582, CD average relative gene expression was 5.64 ± 3.37 (n = 9), which was lower than the healthy controls with homozygous (CC) alleles (8.89 ± 8.03, n = 4).<SEP>For subjects with either heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601, regardless of disease, expression of PTPN22 did not change when compared to the normal (GG) subjects.

The average relative gene expression in CD with heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601 was significantly lower (1.58 ± 0.93, n = 6) compared to 3.40 ± 1.19 (n = 4) in healthy controls with similar SNPs (P-values < 0.05). Specifically, when examining subjects with heterozygous (GA) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601, CD average relative gene expression was 1.48 ± 1.00 (n = 5), which was significantly lower than the healthy controls with heterozygous (GA) alleles (3.40 ± 1.19, n = 4, P < 0.05). Minor (AA) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601 was rare in all subjects.<SEP>Correlation analyses were performed to determine if expression of relative gene expression of IFN-γ changed in subjects with PTPN2:rs478582 or PTPN22:rs2476601 (Figure 3C and 3D, respectively). The average relative gene expression of IFN-γ in CD subjects with the PTPN2:rs478582 heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) allele was 0.41 ± 0.31 (n = 38), which was significantly higher compared to the CD subjects with normal (TT) alleles (0.21 ± 0.22, n = 12, P < 0.05). Specifically, CD subjects with the heterozygous (TC) allele had significantly higher (0.41 ± 0.31, n = 24, P < 0.05) IFN-γ relative gene expression than CD subjects with normal (TT) alleles, while CD subjects with the minor (CC) alleles had higher gene expression as well (0.40 ± 0.31, n = 14). There was no significant change in IFN-γ relative gene expression in the CD subjects with the PTPN22:rs2476601 heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles. However, in healthy controls, subjects with the heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles had a significantly higher gene expression (0.67 ± 0.28, n = 4, P < 0.05) than healthy controls with normal (GG) alleles (0.40 ± 0.21, n = 20).<SEP>Effect of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on susceptibility of MAP infection in CD<SEP>Overall detection of MAP IS900 DNA was found in CD and healthy control subjects and were correlated with PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 (Table 2).

However, PTPN2 was significantly lower in CD subjects than in the health control subjects regardless of MAPbacteremia presence or not. CD subjects who had MAPbacteremia presence had an average relative gene expression of 5.25 ± 2.58 (n = 21) in PTPN2 compared to the healthy controls with MAPbacteremia presence (11.9 ± 10.5, n =3, P < 0.05). CD subjects who had an absence of MAPbacteremia presence had an average relative gene expression of 5.28 ± 2.87 (n = 17) in PTPN2 compared to the healthy controls without MAPbacteremia presence (10.3 ± 6.71, n = 27, P < 0.05). For PTPN22 average relative gene expression, CD subjects with MAPbacteremia presence had 1.73 ± 0.97 (n = 21) compared to healthy controls with MAPbacteremia presence (2.83 ± 1.94, n = 3). CD subjects without MAPbacteremia presence had an average relative gene expression of 1.81 ± 1.31 (n = 17) in PTPN22 compared to the healthy controls without MAPbacteremia presence (3.29 ± 1.86, n = 27, P-values < 0.05).<SEP>The effect of combined MAPbacteremia presence and either PTPN2:rs478582 or PTPN22:rs2476601 did not significantly change PTPN2/22 expression in all CD and healthy control samples. However, when examining the combined effects of MAPbacteremia presence and either PTPN2:rs478582 or PTPN22:rs2476601, the average relative gene expression of IFN-γ does increase in subjects compared to subjects without MAPbacteremia presence and no SNPs.

All five CD subjects that had their T-cell response tested had SNPs in either PTPN2:rs478582 and/or PTPN22:rs2476601, while the five healthy control subjects had no observed SNPs present. Overall, when the subjects’ T-cells were treated with PHA, the average overall fold change in the CD subjects was 2.22 ± 1.36 (n = 5) fold increase compared to the healthy controls (1.67 ± 0.51 fold increase, n = 5). Similarly, when the same T-cells were treated with MAP PPD-like, the average overall fold change in CD subjects was 2.01 ± 0.79 (n = 5) compared to the healthy controls (1.39 ± 0.24 fold increase, n = 5).<SEP>Out of the five CD subjects, 3/5 were tested for having MAPbacteremia presence. When examining T-cells treated with PHA from CD subjects tested positive for MAPbacteremia presence, the average overall fold change was 2.7 ± 1.65 (n = 3) compared to the CD subjects’ T-cells that were absence of MAPbacteremia presence and treated with PHA (1.51 ± 0.51 fold increase, n = 2). Similarly, when the same T-cells were treated with MAP PPD-like, the average overall fold change in CD subjects with MAPbacteremia was 2.5 ± 0.59 (n = 3) compared to the CD subjects’ T-cells without MAPbacteremia presence (1.27 ± 0.12 fold increase, n = 2).","DISCUSSION<SEP>The pathogenesis of CD, as with other inflammatory autoimmune disorders, involves both genetic pre-disposition leading to higher immune responses and an environmental trigger that exacerbates the immune response. However, with current diagnosis and treatment, it has been difficult to treat CD symptoms due to loss of treatment response and many side effects. Thus, understanding the key elements of CD pathogenesis (genetic SNPs and environmental triggers), it is possible to find new treatment targets for the disease and new diagnosis techniques as well. CD pathogenesis is very dependent on the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, which promote chronic inflammation, increased granuloma formation, and increased apoptosis of intestinal tissues. Since the majority of CD medications are blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, other types of targets has been ignored. This study is focused on finding new targets for both diagnosis and treatment of CD, where we looked into the SNPs of negative regulatory genes PTPN2/22 and their impact on: increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, mycobacterial susceptibility, and inflammation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look into SNPs in both PTPN2/22 together along with correlation with gene expression and MAP susceptibility in CD.<SEP>The effect of SNPs in PTPN2/22 in CD pathogenesis has been highly debated in the literature, thus we selected nine SNPs that not only was found associated with CD, but with other diseases as well. Out of the nine SNPs examined in this study, PTPN2:rs478582 was found to be significant in CD (P-values < 0.05, OR = 3.03) compared to the healthy controls (Figure 2A). Although PTPN22:rs2476601 was found to not be significant to CD (P > 0.05, OR = 2.7) compared to the healthy controls, we continued to study the effects of the SNP along with PTPN2:rs478582 due to PTPN22:rs2476601 being associated with inflammatory autoimmune diseases in general (Figure 2B). Since a diverse population (no restriction on race, place of origin, age, or gender) was used in this study, alterations of allele distribution in the SNPs could possibly happen due to SNPs overall fluctuating between different population groups. Further isolated population studies on PTPN2/22 SNPs in CD subjects need to be investigated more. Knowledge of which SNP is more associated with CD could possibly be used as a diagnosis tool for clinicians when examining patients with CD like symptoms.<SEP>Gene expression of PTPN2/22 correlated with the SNPs PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 was also done to determine if the SNPs did change PTPN2/22 levels. Although overall PTPN2/22 expression was significantly decreased in CD subjects (P < 0.05, Figure 3A and 3B), the SNPs PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 did not change gene expression between normal, heterozygous, or minor alleles. However, IFN-γ gene expression was found significantly higher in both CD and healthy controls (P < 0.05) along with an overall increased T-cell activity in subjects that had heterozygous/minor alleles in either PTPN2:rs478582 and/or PTPN22:rs2476601 (Figure 3C and 3D). These correlation analyzes shows that the SNPs PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 may not necessarily change the regulation of the PTPN2/22 gene, but could possible disrupt the protein activity of PTPN2/22. For the PTPN2:rs478582 SNP, a base change (T > C) in intron 3 occurs, where it is theorized that splicing problems could occur during the RNA splicing. This could lead to loss of activity in the protein once fully translated. The PTPN22:rs2476601 SNP is a base change (G > A) that occurs in exon 14, which physically changes the amino acid arginine (R) to a tryptophan (W) on the 620 amino acid residue on the catalytic portion of the PTPN22 protein. It has been highly debated what the R620W does to the PTPN22 protein, but it is suspected to cause the protein to be less active. Overall, the SNPs PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 seem to cause a loss of function in PTPN2/22, thus leading to less negative regulated T-cells. This will lead to a high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which will lead to increased inflammation/apoptosis in intestinal tissues in CD subjects. Other SNPs in PTPN2/22 will need to be studied further to see if those SNPs will alter gene expression of PTPN2/22 instead of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 just altering protein activity. Although we only examined the effect of PTPN2/22 on the expression of IFN-γ, other factors do control IFN-γ expression and production. These include cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-12, which stimulate T-cell production of IFN-γ and cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-10, which decrease T-cell production of IFN-γ. However, since CD and other inflammatory autoimmune disorders are T-cell mediated, we focused only on PTPN2/22 regulation on IFN-γ expression. This is due to PTPN2/22 ultimately acting as negative regulators of T-cell activity and thus controlling IFN-γ production from T-cells. Further investigation of the effect of these other regulatory IFN-γ production cytokines in subjects with SNPs in PTPN2/22 is needed.<SEP>Although the role MAP has been studied in CD pathogenesis extensively, correlation studies with SNPs in PTPN2/22 and MAP susceptibility have not been done before until this study. Overall, the correlation analyzes of SNPs in PTPN2/22 and MAPbacteremia presence showed that the SNPs might have increased susceptibility in CD subjects (Table 2). Specifically, 60.7% (OR = 21.6, P < 0.05) of CD subjects with PTPN2:rs478582 SNP (heterozygous or minor group) had MAPbacteremia presence, while 27.3% (OR = 4.53) subjects with the PTPN22:rs2476601 SNP (heterozygous or minor group) had MAPbacteremia. Limitations however in the detection of MAP IS900 DNA from the blood of subjects’ samples do not provided the information that the MAP bacteria is alive or dead, thus does not show active infection or previous infection. Further culturing of the blood from the subjects is necessary to determine live MAP infection in the subjects examined. The findings found in this study suggest that SNPs in PTPN2/22 increases susceptibility to MAPbacteremia, which is possible due to the lack of negative regulation in the T-cells. Since T-cells control macrophage activity and mycobacterial species such as MAP can survive in infected macrophages, it is important that the T-cells are regulated correctly in order to prevent MAP infection. If problems involving the PTPN2/22 gene regulation or function the PTPN2/22 protein occurs, T-cells will be overactive and in turn will make macrophages overactive as well (Figure 5). This increased activity of macrophages will not only lead to increased pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, but could allow MAP and other intracellular pathogens to survive and grow faster due to the increased activation of newer macrophages. This is why SNPs in PTPN2/22 and the hyperactivity of T-cells should increase susceptibility to intracellular pathogens such as MAP.<SEP>To further test if T-cells from the CD subjects with the PTPN2:rs478582 and the PTPN22:rs2476601 were overactive, we induced isolated T-cells from CD subjects with either PHA or MAP PPD-like. Although we did not isolate out total T-cell populations from mucosal intestinal tissues and instead from peripheral blood draws, we believe that T-cell proliferation will be the same regardless of the source of origin. This is possible due to PTPN2/22 being found in every T-cell population, regardless of the site of isolation, thus SNPs in PTPN2/22 should affect all T-cells in the body in the same way. Overall, CD subjects with the SNPs proliferated more than healthy controls without the SNPs. In addition, CD subjects who had MAPbacteremia presence and SNPs in PTPN2/22 proliferated more than CD subjects who did not have MAPbacteremia presence. These analyzes showed that for T-cells to become overactive, both SNPs in PTPN2/22 and the presence of MAPbacteremia is required to induce the pathogenesis process of CD. This is further evidence that for the pathogenesis of any inflammatory autoimmune disorder, both genetic predisposition and an environmental trigger are needed to cause disease. Further investigation in gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced (IFN-γ for example) by T-cells after being induced with antigens need to be examined. Along with this, further investigation of subpopulations of T-cell activity is needed to determine which T-cell population is more active in subjects with SNPs in PTPN2/22.<SEP>Overall, SNPs in PTPN2/22 lead to overactive T-cell activity and increased susceptibility to intracellular pathogens such as MAP. With genetic testing for SNPs and detection/treatment for mycobacterial infections such as MAP, it is possible for personalized treatment of CD to be an option. Further studies in SNPs in PTPN2/22 and other immunity specific genes need to be researched and correlated with bacterial infections to improve CD diagnosis and treatment.<SEP>ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS<SEP>Research background<SEP>Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and environmental triggers have been associated with a variety inflammatory autoimmune disorders including Crohn’s disease (CD). Specifically, SNPs in the negative regulatory immune genes Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-receptor type 2 and 22 (PTPN2/22) have been associated with CD along with mycobacterial infections. Although both elements have been examined separately, correlation analysis have not been done to determine if SNPs in PTPN2/22 along with a Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) infections do cause a dysregulation in the immune system that could lead to CD symptoms.<SEP>Research motivation<SEP>Due to the flaws of current diagnosis and treatments of CD, new and better methods need to be determined. Investigating the pathogenesis of CD via SNPs analysis and MAP presence could lead to the possibility of individualized diagnosis/treatment for CD patients via genetic testing and antibiotic treatments. Our research could potentially propose newer routes of CD treatment for clinicians in the near future.<SEP>Research objectives<SEP>In this study, we examined the allele distribution in nine SNPs found in PTPN2/22 along with MAP presence in CD and healthy control subjects. Along with this, we determined gene expression of PTPN2/22 and correlated with both SNPs and MAP presence. Lastly, we examined T-cell proliferation of the subjects and correlated that with both SNPs and MAP presence as well. This study overall examined the effects of both SNPs in PTPN2/22 and MAP presence in CD subjects.<SEP>Research methods<SEP>We obtained K2-EDTA coded blood tubes from both CD and healthy control subjects. Each subjects’ blood was examined for PTPN2/22 genotyping by TaqMan™ SNP genotyping, PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ gene expression by real-time PCR (RT-PCR), MAP presence by MAP IS900 nested PCR (nPCR), and T-cell proliferation by BrdU treatment.<SEP>Research results<SEP>We found in this study that the PTPN2:rs478582 SNP and the haplotype combination of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 SNPs were found significant in CD subjects compared to healthy control subjects. Gene expression of PTPN2/22 was also found to be decreased significantly in CD subjects as well. IFN-γ gene expression was found to be significantly higher in subjects with either PTPN2:rs478582 or PTPN22:rs2476601. MAP presence was found significantly in CD subjects compared to the healthy control subjects, were CD subjects with either PTPN2:rs478582 or PTPN22:rs2476601 had higher MAP presence than subjects without SNPs. Overall T-cell proliferation was higher in CD subjects with either SNPs and induced with MAP antigens than subjects who didn’t. These findings should provide more background to the pathogenesis of CD. Further studies into the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by T-cells with SNPs in PTPN2/22 after proliferation needs to be investigated.<SEP>Research conclusions<SEP>This study was done in order to provide answers on the pathogenesis of CD. We have demonstrated that SNPs found in PTPN2/22 are found significantly in CD subjects and the SNPs have the following effects on the immune system: increases T-cell proliferation due to loss of negative regulation, increases pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, and increases susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. This is further evidence that both a genetic predisposition and an environmental trigger are needed to cause disease in inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as CD.<SEP>Research perspectives<SEP>This study has provided us with new, possible targets that could be used in diagnosis methods and treatment for CD. With the data found in this study, the possibility of personalized treatment for CD could be possible with genetic testing for SNPs and antibiotic treatments for MAP. Further testing for other immune gene SNPs are needed in order to fully understand the genetic profile of CD patients. Additional research in MAP’s relationship with CD pathogenesis is also needed to fully understand the effect of MAP in CD patients.",41353,['FOODAL']
34301848,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified over 60 genetic variants that are thought to confer varying degrees of susceptibility for the T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22), which encodes Lymphoid-tyrosine Phosphatase (LYP), is one such candidate gene bearing the strongest T1D risk association after the HLA class II and INS-IGF2 loci. A missense C1858T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the PTPN22 coding sequence results in an LYP variant with an Arginine to Tryptophan substitution at position 620 (R620W) that is associated with increased risk for a number of autoimmune conditions including T1D, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Graves’ Disease, vitiligo, and myasthenia gravis. Most early studies of PTPN22-associated risk centered around lymphocytes, given their central role in autoimmune pathogenesis. However to date, no consensus has been reached regarding whether LYP R620W constitutes a gain- or loss-of-function for phosphatase activity. Moreover, it remains poorly characterized how the risk variant influences human regulatory T cell (Treg) versus conventional T cell (Tconv) function in a manner that facilitates autoimmune disease development.<SEP>Ptpn22 was originally identified in the mouse and later in humans as a cytoplasmic phosphatase predominantly expressed in lymphoid cells. It is composed of a catalytic domain responsible for its phosphatase activity as well as a series of proline rich domains that regulate activity and protein interactions, most notably, with C-terminal Src kinase (CSK). In T cells, LYP dephosphorylates several proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling molecules including LCK, CD3ε, CD3ζ, zeta-chain associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70), and VAV to down-modulate TCR signaling and is therefore, predicted to have a central role in T cell selection, activation, and differentiation. It is known that LYP also functions in B cells, as well as myeloid cells. As such, LYP has been shown to modulate B cell receptor signaling, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, NLRP3 signaling, and outside-in integrin signaling. Hence, LYP serves many functions across the cellular immune landscape, and it is possible that modulation of LYP expression levels may play an important role during immune cell development and activation.<SEP>In murine models, Ptpn22 deficiency has been associated with increased Treg numbers in both the thymus and the periphery as well as with protection against the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Similarly, Ptpn22 deficiency resulted in reduced disease severity and incidence in the SKG mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis as well as enhanced tolerance of allogeneic islet transplants. Conversely, while Ptpn22 deficiency does not confer overt autoimmune disease, it has been shown to facilitate autoimmunity when combined with other genetic risk factors, such as hyperactive CD45 E613R mutation, BXSB background, and the KBxN arthritis model. Similar to its known association with human T1D susceptibility, Ptpn22 has been identified as the candidate gene for the Insulin-dependent diabetes 18.2 (Idd18.2) diabetes susceptibility locus in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. Interestingly, while silencing Ptpn22 expression in NOD mice resulted in reduced incidence of diabetes, expression of the orthologous human risk variant in the endogenous Ptpn22 locus promoted autoimmunity in the NOD strain. Altogether, these observations support the notion that LYP likely influences T cell development and selection in the thymus as well as activation in the periphery, suggesting that the autoimmune-associated variant may confer multifaceted effects on host immunity.<SEP>T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of human T1D patients carrying the LYP-620W variant exhibited reduced proliferation and calcium flux in response to polyclonal stimulation, and heterozygosity for LYP-620W was associated with reduced IL-10 production after stimulation of memory CD4+ T cells. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the LYP-620W variant impairs interactions of LYP with CSK, which are important for regulating TCR signal strength. Further, it is unclear whether the LYP/CSK interaction strengthens or weakens inactivation of the Src family kinase LCK. Thus, there is a need to investigate the complex effects of the LYP-620W variant. In this study, we used a lentiviral gene delivery system to stably overexpress the LYP-620R non-risk and LYP-620W risk variants in human Tconv and Treg. Our objective was to assess the cell-intrinsic effect conferred by LYP-620W in the CD4+ T cell compartment while mitigating epistatic biological variability inherent in studies of genotype-selected donors. The methods herein, may also be applied to other cell types, risk variants, or combinations thereof, to facilitate pathway-directed therapies for autoimmune disorders.","MATERIALS AND METHODS<SEP>Genotyping<SEP>PTPN22 genotype was determined using a Taqman Genotype Assay (ThermoFisher) for rs2476601 per manufacturer instructions. In this report, we refer to the reverse strand genotype (rs2476601 C>T) to match the PTPN22 gene orientation.<SEP>Donors<SEP>Healthy control donors (median age 30.9, range 23.6–38.0 y; N=8) that were homozygous for the non-risk (C/C) PTPN22 variant at rs2476601 were selected from the UFDI Biobank. Fresh venous blood was collected in sodium-heparinized Vacutainer tubes (BD Biosciences) after informed consent in accordance with the University of Florida Institutional Review Board approved protocol (IRB201400703). Leukopack blood donations were also obtained from rs2476601 C/C homozygous individuals under IRB-exempt protocols from Life South Blood Centers (N=9) in sodium citrate. All studies involving human samples were conducted in accordance wth the Declaration of Helsinki.<SEP>Cell Enrichment and Sorting<SEP>For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) experiments, whole blood or leukopaks were pre-enriched by CD4+ T cell negative selection with RosetteSep (Stemcell Technologies) prior to density gradient centrifugation. CD4+ T cells were labeled with fluorescent antibodies against CD4 (RPA-T4), CD45RA (HI100), CD197 (G043H7), CD127 (A019D5) and CD25 (BC96) as previously described. Treg were FACS-purified as CD4+CD25+CD127lo/-, while naïve Tconv were FACS-purified as non-Treg CD4+CD127+CD45RA+CD197+, and memory Tconv were FACS-purified as non-Treg CD4+CD127+CD45RA- on a FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences) as previously described.<SEP>PTPN22 Transcript Quantification<SEP>Leukopak enriched CD4+ T cell subsets were used for endogenous PTPN22 expression kinetic studies. RNA was prepared from 106 naïve Tconv, memory T cells, and Treg either immediately after sorting, or at various time points following activation. Tconv were activated with a 1:1 bead to cell ratio of Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 (ThermoFisher), and Treg were activated with 4:1 ExpAct beads (Miltenyi). Cells were supplemented with growth factor cytokines every 2–3 days: 300U/mL IL-2 for Tregs, 20U/mL IL-2 for Tconv, and after 7 days, 5 ng/μL IL-7 was also added for Tconv. RNA was Qiashredded and extracted using RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Protoscript First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (New England Biolabs). The expression level of PTPN22 was measured using an absolute quantification real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) approach on a Lightcycler 480 platform (Roche Diagnostics). Each reaction well contained 1μL PTPN22 TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay solution (ThermoFisher), 2μL LightCycler480 Probe Master Mix (Roche), and 3μL cDNA in a 20μL reaction. To create the DNA standards for the RT-qPCR assay, the pUC57.LYP620R.fuT2A.eGFP (see Lentiviral Vector Design and Construction) plasmid containing PTPN22 coding sequence (CDS) was serially diluted 10 fold. Lambda DNA was used to bring all standards to equivalent concentrations of total DNA (1.2ng/μL). Six concentrations were prepared ranging from 1.2fg/μL to 12ng/μL of plasmid, in addition to an NTC consistiong of 1.2ng/μL Lambda DNA only. 3μL of standard DNA was used in reactions as above. Standards were converted to transcript copy number by dividing the mass of plasmid per reaction in grams by the plasmid formula weight, where 650g/mol was used as the average nucleotide pair formula weight times the plasmid length. Copy number of each standard per well was log-transformed and plotted against the corresponding Ct value to form a standard curve. The standard curve R2>0.998 for each batch, and all samples were within range of the standard curves. PTPN22 expression level of each sample was extrapolated from the standard curve as previously done.<SEP>Lentiviral Vector Design and Construction<SEP>Design of the LYP620R.fuT2A.eGFP construct began with the human PTPN22 full length isoform coding DNA sequence (CDS) containing the non-risk variant (C at position 1858 of the CDS). Two endogenous EcoRI restriction enzyme sites (GAATTC) within the CDS were synonymously mutated, and the stop codon was removed (Supplemental Figure 1A–B). This was followed by a furin cleavage site, a T2A self-cleaving peptide sequence, and an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) coding sequence (stop codon included). The LYP620R.fuT2A.eGFP was synthesized in a pUC57 cloning vector by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). Site-directed mutagenesis by PCR with pfu DNA polymerase followed by DpnI digest was performed to generate the LYP620W.fuT2A.eGFP construct, which contains the PTPN22 C1858T variant that encodes the LYP R620W amino acid change. These constructs were then subcloned into the pFUGW 3rd generation lentiviral vector. pFUGW expressing only eGFP served as the control vector. Lentiviral preparations were conducted as previously described. All constructs were validated by restriction enzyme digest and sequence analysis.<SEP>Cell Transduction<SEP>FACS-isolated naïve Tconv were activated with a 1:1 bead to cell ratio of Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 (ThermoFisher), and Treg were activated with 4:1 ExpAct beads (Miltenyi). On day 2, the cultures were infected with 0.5 titered units of lentivirus per cell in the presence of 8μg/mL protamine sulfate (Sigma), and spinnoculated as previously described. The cultures were then allowed to expand and rest for at least 21 days after activation, during which they were supplemented with growth factor cytokines every 2–3 days at dosages of 300U/mL IL-2 for Tregs and 20U/mL IL-2 and for Tconv. After 7 days, 5ng/μL IL-7 was also supplemented every 2–3 days with IL-2 for Tconv. Portions of the cultures were FACS-isolated into stably transduced (eGFP+) and mock-transduced (eGFP-) for cytokine and suppression assays. All other assays used the unsorted fractions of the cultures so that the results from stably transduced cells could be normalized to mock-transduced cells.<SEP>Western Blotting<SEP>FACS-isolated transduced (eGFP+) and mock-transduced (eGFP-) fractions were lysed with cold lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma). Protein was quantified via BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). 5μg of protein was denatured with Laemmli sample buffer at 95°C for 5 minutes and run on mini protean TGX gels (BioRad). Transfers were performed using the Transblot Turbo Transfer System (BioRad) and Transblot Turbo Transfer Packs (BioRad). Membranes were washed with 1X TBST, blocked with 5% milk in TBST for 1 hour, and incubated with primary antibody (rabbit anti-human LYP (clone D6D1H), β-actin (polyclonal) or GFP (clone D5.1), Cell Signaling Technologies) overnight at 4°C. Membranes were then washed with TBS-T, and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technologies) for 1 hour at room temperature. Membranes were subsequently washed, developed with Western DuraSignal Substrate (Thermo Scientific), and imaged on the GeneGnome XRQ (Syngene). Western blot band quantification was performed in ImageJ. Serial blots were stripped with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) between probes for 15 minutes at room temperature per manufacturer protocol.<SEP>Calcium Flux<SEP>Stably transduced Tconv or Treg, and their mock-transduced internal control cells, were labeled with 2.5μg/mL FuraRed calcium responsive dye (ThermoFisher) in 1% BSA/HBSS at 37°C for 10 minutes, followed by labeling with Live/Dead Near IR viability dye (ThermoFisher). Cells were then resuspended in HBSS (with Ca2+) containing 10μg/mL goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab’)2 crosslinking antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Next, cells were warmed to 37°C, and fluorescence at 605 nm by a 405 nm laser and at 660 nm by a 532 nm laser was collected on a LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) to indicate high and low calcium, respectively (Supplemental Figure 3A–C). After recording 30 seconds of basal fluorescence, anti-human CD3 (OKT3) was added at 1μg/mL, and fluorescence was acquired for two minutes. FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC) was used to analyze the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) kinetics of FuraRed for the high and low [Ca2+] channels after first gating on live cells by forward and side scatter morphology and viability dye exclusion. The percent change from mock in fluxed calcium was calculated as the percent difference between curves of the mock and transduced cells (Supplemental Figure 3D–G).<SEP>pERK Signaling<SEP>Lentiviral-transduced Tconv or Treg and their mock-transduced internal control cells were labeled with viability dye, then washed into assay buffer (RPMI base medium) and plated at 106 cells per well in 96-well V-bottom plates in the presence of 10μg of anti-mouse IgG crosslinking antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Anti-CD3 (2μg of OKT3) was added at times −10, −5, and −2 minutes. At time 0, wells were fixed with 4% formalin for 10 minutes. Cells were then washed, permeabilized with methanol, and stained with PE-conjugated anti-phospho-ERK (anti-pERK; clone 197G2, Cell Signaling Technology) for 60 minutes. Data was acquired by flow cytometry on an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences), and pERK MFI of live cells was assessed using FlowJo software (Flowjo LLC).<SEP>Proliferation and Suppression Assays<SEP>Lentiviral-transduced (eGFP+) and internal control mock-transduced (eGFP-) cells were labeled with Cell Trace Violet (CTV, ThermoFisher) cell tracking dye and activated with either beads, autologous antigen presenting cells (APCs), 10ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus 1 μM ionomycin, or K562 cell line artificial APCs (aAPCs) which do not express MHC class I or class II molecules but do express murine Fc’ receptor (CD64) and human CD86. In brief, beads were used at a 1:1 bead to cell ratio as described in Cell Transduction above. Autologous APCs, generated from PBMCs that were CD3-depleted (RosetteSep) and exposed to 3000 Rad of gamma irradiation, were cultered 1:1 with T cells in the presence of 2μg/mL anti-CD3 and 1μg/mL anti-CD28. To generate aAPCs, K562 cells (human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) line) expressing murine CD64 and human CD86 were incubated with various ratios of mouse anti-human CD3 (OKT3) and isotype antibody, and then irradiated with 3000 Rad. The ratios of isotype to OKT3 used were 1:0, 9:1, 1:1, and 0:1, such that the resulting aAPCs were loaded with 0, 10, 50, and 100% anti-CD3, respectively. aAPC were similarly labelled to include mouse anti-human CD4 (OKT4) in ratios of 1:0:0, 1:0.5:0.5, and 0:0.5:0.5 (isotype:OKT3:OKT4), such that the resulting aAPCs were loaded with 0, 5, 25, and 50% each activating antibody. These were cultured at a 1:4 aAPC to T cell ratio.<SEP>Suppression assays were performed as previously described. Briefly, titering proportions of Tregs labelled with Cell Proliferation Dye eFluor670 (CPD670, ThermoFisher) were co-cultured with autologous CTV-labelled responder Tconv (Tresp) and unlabelled APCs ranging from 1:1:1 to 0:1:1 Treg:Tresp:APC ratios. Suppression assay cultures were set up in triplicate in round-bottom 96-well plates and activated with 2μg/mL anti-CD3 and 1μg/mL anti-CD28. Two versions of the suppression assays were performed. The first, which was designed to assess the response of LYP-modulated Tconv to Treg suppression, consisted of a combination of stably-transduced and mock-transduced Tconv (not eGFP-sorted) being suppressed by unmodulated Treg (mock-transduced sorted eGFP-). The second, which was designed to assess suppression by LYP-modulated Treg, consisted of unmodulated Tconv (mock-transduced sorted eGFP-) being suppressed by stably-transduced Treg (sorted GFP+).<SEP>Proliferation and suppression assay data were acquired on an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences), and analyze using FlowJo software (Flowjo LLC). Live T cells were gated by forward and side scatter morphology, followed by viability dye exclusion. Proliferation of live-gated cell-tracking dye+ cells was assessed by expansion index. Suppression was calculated as the percent decrease in Tresp proliferation when co-cultured with Tregs as compared to when cultured without Tregs.<SEP>Surface Marker Activation Kinetics<SEP>Stably transduced (eGFP+) and internal control mock-transduced (eGFP-) cells were activated with irradiated autologous APCs at 1:1 in the presence of 2μg/mL anti-CD3 and 1μg/mL anti-CD28. The cultures were harvested at 0h, 4h, 24h, 48h, 72h, and 144h and stained with Live/Dead Near-IR viability dye (ThermoFisher). Next, the cells were washed into 2% FCS in PBS and labelled with CD278 (C398.4A, BioLegend), CD69 (FN50, BioLegend), CD4 (RPA-T4, BioLegend), CD226 (11A8, BioLegend), CD25 (BC96, BioLegend), CD279 (EH12.2H7, eBiosciences), CTLA4 (L3D10, BioLegend). The cells then were fixed in 1% formaldehyde in PBS. Data was acquired on an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) and was analyzed using FlowJo software (Flowjo LLC). Live lymphocytes from CD4+ T cell cultures were gated by forward and side scatter morphology, followed by viability dye exclusion before extracting surface marker expression. Fluorescence minus-one (FMO) controls were used to set gates for marker positivity.<SEP>Cytokine Detection<SEP>Stably transduced (eGFP+) T cells were activated with irradiated autologous APCs at 1:1 in the presence of 2μg/mL anti-CD3 and 1μg/mL anti-CD28. Supernatants were collected at the specified time points, and cytokines were detected via multiplexed bead-based ELISA.<SEP>Statistics<SEP>Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis or by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s posttest, and graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism software v6. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Subject matching was used to compare donors’ cells across experimental conditions (biological replicates).","RESULTS<SEP>PTPN22 expression varies by lymphocyte subset and activation state.<SEP>We examined endogenous PTPN22 expression in human naïve, memory, and regulatory CD4+ T cell subsets at rest and following in vitro activation. CD4+ T cells were sorted from leukopacks determined to be homozygous for the T1D non-risk allele, which encodes LYP-620R. Since the transcriptional profile of activated cells is dramatically altered from that of the quiescent state, such that the standard array of housekeeping genes is broadly upregulated, we employed absolute quantification to assess PTPN22 expression. At rest, naïve Tconv expressed significantly less PTPN22 (387±83 transcripts/ng total RNA) than memory Tconv cells (741±169 transcripts/ng total RNA, P < 0.05) and Tregs (1014±120 transcripts/ng total RNA, P < 0.001) (Figure 1A). Following polyclonal activation, all three subsets rapidly increased PTPN22 expression, peaking at 24 hours (Figure 1B). Naïve CD4+ Tconv increased 12.00±5.45 fold from the quiescent state whereas memory Tconv increased 4.01±0.89 fold (P < 0.001 vs. naïve) and Treg increased 2.85±1.31 fold (P < 0.01 vs. naïve). Following the initial increase, PTPN22 expression decreased and plateaued around day 7. Taken together, we found PTPN22 expression to differ across T cell subsets at rest and in response to activation.<SEP>Overexpression of PTPN22 decreases TCR signaling.<SEP>Next, we examined whether LYP-620R and −620W may differentially modulate T cell function in Tconv and Treg populations. Naïve CD4+ Tconv and Treg were sorted from PBMCs from normal healthy control donors that were homozygous for the T1D non-risk PTPN22 allele (C/C at rs2476601 encoding LYP-620R). Cells were then activated and transduced with a lentivirus to express bicistronic constructs of the non-risk LYP-620R or the risk LYP-620W variant with an eGFP reporter following a 2A element, or with eGFP alone for a vector control condition (Supplemental Figure 1A–B). The cultures were expanded, followed by an extended rest period for a total of 21–28 days to allow for reversion of activation programs. We confirmed stable overexpression of PTPN22 transcripts and LYP protien for each variant (Supplemental Figure 1C–E and Supplemental Figure 2).<SEP>The proximal signaling events resulting from TCR ligation lead to assembly and activation of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) signalosome, followed by diverging downstream signaling pathways. These include calcium signaling and MAPK/ERK pathways. We sought to determine the functional impact of the non-risk and risk LYP variants on these downstream signaling pathways in Tconv and Treg. We first assessed Ca2+ flux by comparing stably transduced cells to non-transduced (eGFP-) internal culture control cells (Supplemental Figure 3). As expected, LYP-620R expressing Tconv exhibited 25.8±3.7% less Ca2+ flux than non-transduced Tconv, whereas transduction with eGFP alone had no effect (Figure 2A). A similar effect was observed for LYP-620R Tregs in which Ca2+ flux was diminished by 40.3±13.3% compared to non-transduced Tregs (Figure 2B). Conversely, LYP-620W expression only resulted in 4.9±1.6% and 7.9±2.7% less Ca2+ flux in Tconv and Treg, respectively (Figure 2A–B). These differences were not different from T cells transduced with eGFP alone. Thus, the risk LYP-620W variant less effectively downregulated TCR-induced Ca2+ flux.<SEP>We next assessed the impact of LYP modulation on the MAPK/ERK pathway via pERK signaling following TCR ligation. As with Ca2+ signaling, we observed decreased pERK relative to mock transfected cells in both Tconv and Tregs when LYP-620R was overexpressed (Figure 2C–D). Once again, the impact of LYP-620W on TCR signaling was diminished in both subsets when compared to LYP-620R. Taken together, these results indicate that the LYP risk variant has a diminished capacity to regulate TCR signaling activity.<SEP>The risk variant of PTPN22 permits increased T cell activation.<SEP>In response to Ca2+ flux and pERK signaling, T cells express receptors on their surface to direct activation. We further explored the impact of LYP variants by examining the experssion of a set of these activation markers. Stably transduced T cells were activated with autologous APCs, and surface expression of activation markers was assessed at 0, 4, 24, 48, 72, and 144 hours by flow cytometry. As expected, CD69, ICOS, CD25, CD226, and PD-1 were observed to be dynamically expressed following Tconv activation (Supplemental Figure 4A–D). Likewise, Tregs also exhibited activation-induced expression kinetics for CD69, ICOS, CD226, CTLA-4 (Supplemental Figure 4E–F). Interestingly, while most activation marker kinetics involved an intensification followed by a reduction of surface expression, the kinetics of CD226 on Tregs waned before increasing to a level higher than baseline (Supplemental Figure 4H). When normalized to internal mock-transfected controls, the activation marker kinetics on both Tconv (Figure 3A–E) and Tregs (Figure 3F–J) were blunted by overexpression of LYP-620R, with the exception of CD226 on Tconv (Figure 3D). Similar to what was observed with Ca2+ and pERK signaling, cells expressing the LYP-620W variant were less impacted, supporting the notion that the R620W variant confers a loss-of-function for LYP in terms of modulating of T cell activation.<SEP>The PTPN22 risk variant permits proliferation in Tconv, but not in Treg.<SEP>We demonstrated that the two LYP variants differentially modulate TCR signaling and expression of T cell activation markers. We next asked whether overexpression of the LYP variants would differentially modulate T cell proliferation. Activation-induced proliferation of Tconv and Treg cells was assessed by dilution of cell tracking dye following in vitro activation. Transduced cells (eGFP+) were cultured with mock-transduced (eGFP-) internal culture control cells. The cultures were activated with either anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 with irradiated APCs, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 bound to microbeads, or with PMA and ionomycin. While expression of the eGFP reporter did not affect proliferation, overexpression of LYP-620R reduced APC-mediated proliferation of Tconv and Treg by 35.32±15.30% and 19.80±17.26%, respectively (Figure 4A–B). In Tconv, the LYP-620W variant was once again deficient in its ability to downregulate activation, as it did not impede proliferation to the same degree that was observed for the LYP-620R variant (Figure 4A). However, the LYP-620W variant was capable of blocking Treg proliferation to a similar degree as the LYP-620R variant (Figure 4B), indicating a differential impact of PTPN22 on Tconv and Tregs.<SEP>As expected, mitogenic activation by PMA and ionomycin was not altered by LYP overexpression, as all transduced Tconv and Treg proliferated to a comparable degree as their internal mock control cells (Figure 4A–B). Unexpectedly however, proliferation was also unaltered in transduced cells that were activated by microbeads (Figure 4A–B). To assess whether this was due to TCR signal strength, we repeated the experiment with K562 aAPCs loaded with titrated ratios of activating and isotype antibodies. The aAPCs did not induce proliferation when loaded with 0% anti-CD3 (100% isotype), whereas 10% and 50% anti-CD3 induced incrementally more proliferation, with a plateau from 50% to 100% anti-CD3 (Supplemental Figure 5A). In all cases, the proliferation of transduced cells was similar to their internal controls (Supplemental Figure 5B). Similar results were found when CD4 was included in the activation signal to allow for LYP-LCK interactions (Supplemental Figure 5C–D). This suggests that optimized signal strength, as well as fluid membrane interface are not sufficient to recapitulate the differential inhibition of proliferation by the two LYP variants, and that other factors supplied by natural APCs (e.g., adhesion molecules, soluble factors, and/or co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory ligand and downstream signaling interactions) may be required.<SEP>Overexpression of PTPN22 influences T cell cytokine production.<SEP>CD4+ effector T cells modulate host immune responses after encountering cognate antigens, in part, through the production of an array of cytokines. Thus, we sought to assess the impact of LYP variant expression on the secretion of cytokines important in driving Th1 and Th2-associated immunity. Sorted transduced Tconv cells were activated with APCs, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28, and culture supernatants were assayed for cytokines over a 72-hour time period. The net accumulation of IL-2 in this system is a function of activation-induced secretion and of consumption via the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) because the high-affinity component, CD25, is dramatically upregulated in this time period (Supplemental Figure 4). We found that the net accumulation of IL-2 was not altered by overexpression of the LYP-620R variant, but was increased at the 24-hour time point by the LYP-620W variant (Figure 5A). The secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 was robustly inhibited for the first 48 hours by expression of either LYP variant. At the72-hour time point, inhibition occurred to a somewhat lesser degree by LYP-620W, thought this difference was not significant between variants (Figure 5B–F). Finally, and somewhat surprisingly given the documented Th1 signature implicated in several of the autoimmune disorders that are associated with the rs2476601 risk variant, IFNγ secretion was not altered by overexpression of either variant of LYP (Figure 5G). This result is in agreement with studies of Ptpn22 knockout mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both LYP variants result in similar levels of effector cytokine secretion.<SEP>Treg-mediated suppression is altered by overexpressed PTPN22.<SEP>Our data demonstrated that PTPN22 is more highly expressed in Treg as compared to Tconv (Figure 1A). We therefore hypothesized that the PTPN22 risk variant may influence disease risk by altering Treg-mediated suppression. Hence, we assessed whether transduced Treg were deficient in their suppressive capacity and whether transduced Tconv were refractory to Treg suppression. In order to determine the effect of overexpressed LYP variants on Tresp, irradiated autologous APCs and titered amounts of Treg were co-cultured with transduced Tconv (eGFP+) and mock-transduced (eGFP-) internal control Tconv. We found that, similar to our previous results (Figure 4A), overexpressed LYP-620R significantly repressed Tresp proliferation while repression by LYP-620W was dramatically reduced across the Treg:Tresp range (Figure 6A). However, the relative suppression of transduced Tresp did not differ significantly from their internal mock controls (Figure 6B). This suggests that the Tconv-intrinsic susceptibility conferred by LYP-620W is due to reduced control over activation, proliferation, and effector mechanisms, rather than a defect in the ability of effector cells to be suppressed by Treg.<SEP>Finally, we assessed the effect of the LYP variants on Treg suppressive capacity by co-culturing titered amounts of sorted transduced (eGFP+) Treg with irradiated autologous APCs and untransduced Tresp. We found suppression by Tregs overexpressing LYP-620R to be similar to eGFP reporter Tregs, while suppression by Tregs expressing the risk LYP-620W variant was slightly increased (Figure 6C). Consistent with our previous result (Figure 4B), Treg proliferation in the suppression assay co-culture was similar for LYP-620R and LYP-620W (Figure 6D). This indicates that the difference in suppressive capacity was not due to differences in Treg proliferation, and suggests a Treg intrinsic impact of LYP-620W to enhance suppressive function.","DISCUSSION<SEP>To date, much of the literature has attempted to categorize rs2476601, the PTPN22 C1858T autoimmune-associated missense mutation, as a loss- or gain-of-function variant. Because the LYP-620W variant confers risk for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, we were interested in its allotypic effects on TCR signaling and function in the Tconv and Treg subsets. We first evaluated endogenous PTPN22 expression in primary human T cells homozygous for the T1D non-risk allele encoding LYP-620R. We then employed a lentiviral gene delivery system to induce constitutive overexpression of the T1D non-risk variant, LYP-620R, or T1D risk variant, LYP-620W, in primary human CD4+ Tconv and Tregs. There are a few advantages to this approach. First, it enables expansion of primary cell material that stably expresses either the non-risk or risk variant for long-term assays. Second, by isolating LYP variant overexpression to CD4+ T cells, the complicating effects of the LYP variant from other immune subsets are removed so that CD4+ T cell-intrisic effects can be studied. Finally, it controls for epistasis and the associated biologic variability by assessing the functional differences of the LYP variants within the same subjects.<SEP>Our observation that endogenous expression of PTPN22 varies by T cell subset and is dynamic throughout activation suggests that SNP-related functional effects are multifaceted and may differ across cell types in a manner that is subject to temporal control and activation state in the periphery. Importantly, our assay measured both splice variants which encode the 85 kD and 105 kD LYP isoforms that are differentially expressed in T cells at rest and after activation, respectively, thereby measuring total endogenous PTPN22 expression. Due to the MAF of rs2476601, we were unable to assess PTPN22 expression kinetics of the 620W variant using the methods herein. We will persue this question using scRNA-Seq technology, which requires many fewer cells, thus enabling time course examination of genotype-selected, cryopreserved PBMCs. We next demonstrated that, as expected, overexpression of LYP-620R decreases T cell Ca2+ flux, pERK signaling, surface expression of activation markers, and proliferation in both Tconv and Tregs. However, with the exception of Treg proliferation, overexpression of LYP-620W had little effect on TCR activation-induced responses. We therefore conclude that LYP-620W is hypomorphic in terms of CD4+ T cell responses to TCR activation.<SEP>Interestingly, proliferation was only affected by PTPN22 modulation in the context of APC activation, indicating a requirement for a natural immune synapse or specific costimulatory signaling. Burn et al. showed that primary human T cells with the endogenous LYP-620W variant had increased pERK1/2 induced by LFA-1/ICAM-1 outside-in signaling as compared to T cells expressing the LYP-620R variant. This resulted in stronger integrin-mediated adhesion that was resistant to shear forces, which may also apply to cell-cell interactions. Thus, whereas interactions between autoreactive T cells and APCs may normally be transient, expression of the LYP-620W variant may stabilize the immune synapse allowing for more efficient activation and initiation of autoreactivity. Similar experiments comparing LYP variants in the APC are necessitated to determine if the reported effect on synapse stability occurs bidirectionally.<SEP>Treg proliferation was blunted by LYP overexpression, but contrary to Tconv, Treg proliferation was not differentially impacted by the two LYP variants. This was the case when cultured alone with APCs as well as with APCs and Tconv in the context of suppression assays. Overall suppressive capacity was not affected for LYP-620R Tregs and was enhanced for LYP-620W Tregs. The data presented here further indicate that certain mechanisms of suppression, perhaps IL-2 consumption or regulatory cytokine production, may not be affected by LYP expression, while other mechanisms, such as contact-dependent co-inhibitory receptor interactions, may only be affected by the LYP-620W variant. It was previously shown that Tregs from Ptpn22 deficient mice had improved suppressive function due to increased and prolonged LFA-1 interactions between Tresp and Tregs. This is in line with the finding that LYP-620W is a loss-of-function variant with respect to outside-in integrin signaling, which results in sustained LFA-1 interactions. We previously showed that Tregs expressing a higher affinity TCR are more potent suppresors. Sustained Treg interactions conferred by LYP-620W may be functionally similar to higher affinity TCR engagement, resulting in enhanced suppressive capacity per cell (Figure 6C). Nevertheless, enhanced Treg suppressive capacity does not support a mechanism for autoimmune pathogenesis. In fact, suppression assays from rs2476601 T/T individuals were recently shown to exhibit lower suppression than those from C/C subjects. Thus, we posit that progression to autoimmunity may occur when the LYP-620W deficit in restraint of Tconv proliferation overcomes the LYP-620W enhancement of Treg suppression.<SEP>In terms of cytokine production, IL-2 accumulation was not altered in T cells overexpressing LYP-620R, but was increased by the LYP-620W variant. This finding is consistent with observations of the murine Pep-R619W ortholog knock-in. While further studies are required to determine if this is attributable to increased production or reduced consumption, this result may corroborate the observed differential effects of LYP variants on Tconv proliferation. The secretion of effector cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13) was inhibited by overexpression of either variant, but this effect appeared to wane in LYP-620W Tconv by the 72-hour time point. IFNγ production by Tconv was not altered by overexperession of either LYP variant. This is in contrast to observations in a murine model of Ptpn22 overexpression, which exhibited decreased IFNγ production in effector T cells. We also did not observe increased IFNγ production in in LYP-620W expressing cells relative to LYP-620R expressing cells. Conversely, Anderson et al. recently reported increased IFNγ production and activation marker expression in PTPTN22-deficient human CD4+ T cells after 48 hours of reactivation. Those results suggests that a loss-of-function variant may also result in enhanced IFNγ secretion. While, the reason for these observed differences between experimental model systems is not clear at this point, we posit that constitutive overexpression and CRISPR knock-out systems impact LYP stoichiometry with TCR signaling molecules in an opposing manner. As such, cytokine regulation may not be affected in the same manner as activation and proliferation.<SEP>Faced with inconsistent reports in the current literature, our data nonetheless support the notion that the risk LYP-620W variant is generally a loss-of-function variant in Tconv, as TCR signaling, activation, and proliferation are less affected by its overexpression compared to LYP-620R. Still, the fundamental question of whether the LYP-620W functional decrease results from abrogated phosphatase activity or altered localization remains outstanding. While altered localization may also expose a distinct set of targets to dephosphorylation, it likely also disengages LYP-620W from the TCR signalosome, where its modulatory capacity is specifically tied to weaker TCR signaling. In this regard, differences in activation threshold, signal strength, and costimulation between Tconv and Treg may make them differentially amenable to LYP modulation. In the context of recurrent autoreactive T cell responses, which tend confer weaker low-affinity TCR signaling in memory T cells, the net effect may be the outgrowth of autoreactive Tconv relative to Treg. Future studies will examine the nature of our observed loss of function.<SEP>Despite the advantages of the lentiviral gene delivery methods utilized herein, there are caveats to consider when interpretating our results. First, while constitutive overexpression induced by our lentiviral constructs is useful for unmasking differences between variants, it does not provide equivalent kinetics to those observed for endogenous PTPN22 expression. Hence, more careful control of expression may be required for mechanistic studies of temporal LYP activity. Second, in this experimental system we are examining the the effect of LYP variant expression in the context of endogenous LYP-620R. In that regard, these data are analogous to comparing homozygous non-risk to heterozygous risk LYP variants, with the caveat of continual and mild overexpression (3–6 fold higher LYP protein expression, Supplemental Figure 1E) from the LV construct. However, a qPCR assay could have been designed for a more thorough analysis of exogenous vs endogenous expression. This is an important consideration because amount of LYP relative to its binding parters, most notably CSK, influences the degree of dephosphorylation of TCR signaling. Further studies are required to determine how this modest LYP overexpression relative to CSK impacts the biological outcome. Third, for efficient integration to occur, we transduce actively dividing cells. We are therefore unable to examine LYP functional aspects during primary activation, for example to study naïve vs memory or to determine the impact on polarization. Finally, we have only examined the 620W effect in the full length isoform. Several isoforms of LYP are expressed in human T cells, and variation in phosphatase activity, cellular localization, and association with autoimmune disease have been reported.<SEP>Considering the various roles for LYP in modulating immune responsiveness of T cells, B cells, APCs, neutrophils and more, it is not surprising that the effects of the LYP-R620W are complex, even within the CD4+ T cell compartment. Further, there is a need for understanding the role of LYP in B and T cell central tolerance. Indeed, it is likely that the phenotypes observed here from T cell LYP variant expression would have additional implications in vivo and that cell-specific downstream effects of the PTPN22 SNP (rs2476601) may work in concert for altered effector function. Hence, there is a need moving forward for additional investigation of SNP-mediated in vitro versus in vivo effects. We plan to address these questions through ongoing efforts to build isogenic cellular systems to model multiple cell-cell interactions utilizing gene editing technologies. It is clear that rs2476601 contributes susceptibility for a number of autoimmune diseases including T1D, likely related to functional consequences within the T cell compartment. We demonstrated, herein, that the risk variant imparts a hypomorphic phenotype marked by impaired ability to down-regulate T cell activation and effector function, supporting the notion that PTPN22 represents an important target for therapies aimed at preventing or reversing autoimmune disorders, including T1D.",41691,['FOODAL']
30510550,"Introduction<SEP>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cell therapy in patients with CD19+ B-cell malignancies have demonstrated impressive clinical responses, which recently resulted in two landmark FDA approvals for patients with leukemia and lymphoma. These studies have shown that CAR T cells can be optimized to induce durable and complete responses in cancer patients, even under conditions of highly refractory disease. Major obstacles in developing effective CAR T cell therapies for solid cancers are avoiding off-tumor on-target toxicity due to the lack of truly restricted tumor antigens, as well as achieving durable responses that are limited by T cell persistence and tumor trafficking. To date, the majority of tumor antigens for directing specificity of CAR T cells have targeted over-expressed proteins, including but not limited to mesothelin, PSMA, PSCA, HER2/neu, EGFR, and IL13Rα2. While the field is still evolving, clinical efficacy of CAR T cells targeting these proteins in solid tumors has been somewhat limited, and identification of additional targets as well as addressing limited T cell durability is critically important to the successful translation of CAR T cell therapies.<SEP>Aberrantly glycosylated cell surface proteins have long been implicated in tumor development, and have unique glycoprotein signatures that are attractive targets for immunotherapy, including CAR T cells. Multiple cancer types including colon, breast, pancreas, and ovarian, are known to over-express aberrantly glycosylated proteins, including the mucins MUC16 and MUC1, and the tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 antigen (TAG72), that differentiate them from normal epithelia. TAG72 is the truncated sialyl Tn (STn) O-glycan carbohydrate hapten located on multiple cell surface O-glycoproteins. High expression of TAG72, MUC1, and MUC16 has been shown in ovarian cancer patient tissue samples, with nearly 100% of ovarian cancers identified with simultaneous staining of the three antigens. Importantly, approximately 90% of epithelial ovarian cancers are TAG72 positive, indicating its abundance across multiple histological subtypes of ovarian cancer.<SEP>Several monoclonal antibodies that primarily target the tumor-associated STn have been developed, including the well-studied clone, CC49. CC49 has been subsequently utilized in multiple pre-clinical and clinical investigations using diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy and also involved in multiple attempts of antibody humanization. An early clinical trial of a first-generation CAR T cell targeting TAG72 in colorectal cancer patients demonstrated safety, but with limited anti-tumor responses, likely attributed to the limited T cell persistence and/or anti-idiotype responses from inadequate scFv humanization. Given the optimization of CAR T cells in recent years, and the incorporation of intracellular co-stimulatory signaling domains in second-generation CARs that has greatly improved anti-tumor activity, cytokine production and T cell persistence, an evaluation of second-generation CAR T cells targeting TAG72 warrants further investigation.<SEP>Here, we describe the generation and anti-tumor efficacy of a second-generation CAR T cell with a humanized anti-human TAG-72 scFv antigen-binding domain and a 4-1BB intracellular co-stimulatory signaling domain (TAG72-BBζ). In vitro, TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells demonstrate potent antigen-dependent cytotoxicity against multiple TAG72-expressing human ovarian cancer cell lines and epithelial cells derived from patient ovarian cancer ascites. Furthermore, using in vivo peritoneal ovarian tumor models, we show that regional intraperitoneal delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells eliminate antigen-positive disease and extends overall survival of mice, while intravenous CAR T cell delivery was ineffective in controlling disease. We also demonstrate that repeat regional infusions of CAR T cells promote more durable control of disease compared to single treatment. However, reduced TAG72 expression was observed in early recurring tumors, which coincided with a lack of T cell persistence in our models. Interestingly, late recurring tumors showed re-expression of TAG72, which will require additional mechanistic investigations. These preclinical findings support TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells as a viable therapeutic option for ovarian cancers, and also highlight its broader application for multiple TAG72-expressing solid cancers.","Materials and methods<SEP>Cell lines<SEP>The epithelial ovarian cancer line OVCAR-3 (herein referred to as OVCAR3, ATCC HTB-161) was cultured in RPMI-1640 (Lonza) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) and 1X antibiotic-antimycotic (1X AA, Gibco) (complete RPMI). The epithelial ovarian cancer line derived from metastatic ascites OV-90 (herein referred to as OV90, CRL-11732) was cultured in a 1:1 mixture of MCDB 105 medium (Sigma) and Medium 199 (Thermo) adjusted to pH of 7.0 with sodium hydroxide (Sigma) and final 20% FBS and 1X AA. The epithelial-endometroid ovarian cancer line COV362.4 (Sigma) was cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) containing 10% FBS, 1X AA, 25 mM HEPES (Irvine Scientific), and 2 mM L-Glutamine (Fisher Scientific) (complete DMEM). The epithelial ovarian cancer line OVCAR-8 (herein referred to as OVCAR8) was a generous gift from Dr. Carlotta Glackin at City of Hope and was cultured in complete RPMI-1640. The epithelial ovarian cancer line SK-OV-3 (herein referred to as SKOV3, ATCC HTB-77) and the colon epithelial cancer line LS 174T (herein referred to as LS174T, ATCC CL-188) were cultured in complete DMEM. DU145-PSCA cells were described previously. All cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2.<SEP>DNA constructs and lentivirus production<SEP>Tumor cells were engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase (eGFP/ffluc) by transduction with epHIV7 lentivirus carrying the eGFP/ffluc fusion under the control of the EF1α promoter as described previously. The humanized scFv sequence used in the CAR construct was obtained from a monoclonal antibody clone huCC49 that targets TAG72. The extracellular spacer domain included the 129-amino acid middle-length CH2-deleted version (ΔCH2) of the IgG4 Fc spacer. The intracellular co-stimulatory signaling domain contained was a 4-1BB with a CD4 transmembrane domain. The CD3ζ cytolytic domain was previously described. The CAR sequence was separated from a truncated CD19 gene (CD19t) by a T2A ribosomal skip sequence, and cloned in an epHIV7 lentiviral backbone under the control of the EF1α promoter. The PSCA-BBζ CAR construct was described previously.<SEP>Lentivirus was generated as previously described. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with packaging plasmid and CAR lentiviral backbone plasmid using a modified calcium phosphate method. Viral supernatants were collected after 3–4 days and treated with 2 mM magnesium and 25 U/mL Benzonase® endonuclease (EMD Millipore). Supernatants were concentrated via high-speed centrifugation and lentiviral pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-lactose solution (4 g lactose per 100 mL PBS), aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Lentiviral titers were quantified using HT1080 cells based on CD19t expression.<SEP>T cell isolation, lentiviral transduction, and ex vivo expansion<SEP>Leukapheresis products were obtained from consented research participants (healthy donors) under protocols approved by the City of Hope Internal Review Board (IRB). On the day of leukapheresis, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) followed by multiple washes in PBS/EDTA (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were rested overnight at room temperature (RT) on a rotator, and subsequently washed and resuspended in X-VIVO T cell medium (Lonza) containing 10% FBS (complete X-VIVO). Up to 5.0 × 109 PBMC were incubated with anti-CD14 and anti-CD25 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 30 min at RT and magnetically depleted using the CliniMACS® system (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's protocol and these were termed depleted PBMCs (dPBMC). dPBMC were frozen in CryoStor® CS5 (StemCell Technologies) until further processing.<SEP>T cell activation and transduction was performed as described previously. Briefly, freshly thawed dPBMC were washed once and cultured in complete X-VIVO containing 100 U/mL recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2, Novartis Oncology) and 0.5 ng/mL recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15, CellGenix). For CAR lentiviral transduction, T cells were cultured with CD3/CD28 Dynabeads® (Life Technologies), protamine sulfate (APP Pharmaceuticals), cytokine mixture (as stated above), and desired lentivirus at a multiplicity or infection (MOI) of 1 the day following bead stimulation. Cells were then cultured in and replenished with fresh complete X-VIVO containing cytokines every 2–3 days. After 7 days, beads were magnetically removed, and cells were further expanded in complete X-VIVO containing cytokines to achieve desired cell yield. CAR T cells were positively selected for CD19t using the EasySep™ CD19 Positive Enrichment Kit I or II (StemCell Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following further expansion, cells were frozen in CryoStor® CS5 prior to in vitro functional assays and in vivo tumor models. Purity and phenotype of CAR T cells were verified by flow cytometry.<SEP>Flow cytometry<SEP>For flow cytometric analysis, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution without Ca2+, Mg2+, or phenol red (HBSS−/−, Life Technologies) containing 2% FBS and 1 × AA). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. For secondary staining, cells were washed twice prior to 30 min incubation at 4°C in the dark with either Brilliant Violet 510 (BV510), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), peridinin chlorophyll protein complex (PerCP), PerCP-Cy5.5, PE-Cy7, allophycocyanin (APC), or APC-Cy7 (or APC-eFluor780)-conjugated antibodies. Antibodies against CD3 (BD Biosciences, Clone: SK7), CD4 (BD Biosciences, Clone: SK3), CD8 (BD Bosciences, Clone: SK1), CD14 (BD Biosciences, Clone: MΦP9), CD19 (BD Biosciences, Clone: SJ25C1), CD25 (BD Biosciences, Clone: 2A3), mouse CD45 (BioLegend, Clone: 30-F11), CD45 (BD Biosciences, Clone: 2D1), CD69 (BD Biosciences, Clone: L78), CD137 (BD Biosciences, Clone: 4B4-1), MUC1 (BioLegend, Clone 16A), MUC16 (Abcam, Clone X75 or EPSISR23), biotinylated Protein-L (GenScript USA), TAG72 (Clone, muCC49), Donkey Anti-Rabbit Ig (Invitrogen), Goat Anti-Mouse Ig (BD Biosciences), and streptavidin (BD Biosciences) were used. Cell viability was determined using 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). Flow cytometry was performed on a MACSQuant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec), and the data was analyzed with FlowJo software (v10, TreeStar).<SEP>In vitro tumor killing and T cell functional assays<SEP>For tumor killing assays, CAR T cells and tumor targets were co-cultured at indicated effector:tumor (E:T) ratios in complete X-VIVO in the absence of exogenous cytokines in 96-well plates for 24–72 h and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. Tumor cells were plated overnight prior to addition of T cells. Tumor killing by CAR T cells was calculated by comparing CD45-negative DAPI-negative (viable) cell counts relative to that observed when targets were co-cultured with Mock (untransduced) T cells. For T cell activation assays, CAR T cells and tumor targets were co-cultured at the indicated E:T ratios in complete X-VIVO in the absence of exogenous cytokines in 96-well plates for the indicated time points and analyzed by flow cytometry for specific markers of T cell activation. Frozen, uncultured patient primary ovarian cancer ascites (OAS3, OAS4, and OAS7) were thawed and immediately evaluated in T cell functional assays. A ascites fluid from ovarian cancer patients was obtained from City of Hope National Medical Center (COH) surgical staff in a sterile vacuum container with approval from the COH Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Office of Human Subjects Protection. The COH IRB waived the need for written informed consent as all samples were de-identified and ascites was discard material as previously described.<SEP>For T cell activation assays on plate-bound antigen, purified soluble TAG72 antigen (BioRad) was plated in duplicate at indicated TAG72 units overnight at 4°C in 1X PBS in 96-well flat bottom high-affinity plates (Corning). Using a Bradford protein assay, the 20,000 units/mL stock solution of soluble TAG72 antigen was determined to be approximately 1.234 mg/mL of total protein. A total of 104 TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells were then added in a fixed volume of 100 μL to each well and incubated for indicated times prior to collection of cells for analysis of activation markers (CD69, CD137) by flow cytometry. Supernatants were also collected for analysis of cytokine production.<SEP>Elisa cytokine assays<SEP>Supernatants from tumor killing assays or CAR T cell activation assays on plate-bound TAG72 antigen were collected at indicated times and frozen at −20°C for further use. Supernatants were then analyzed for secreted human IFNγ and IL-2 according to the Human IFNγ and IL-2 ELISA Ready-SET-GO!®; ELISA kit manufacturer's protocol, respectively. Plates were read at 450 nm using a Wallac Victor3 1420 Counter (Perkin-Elmer) and the Wallac 1420 Workstation software.<SEP>In vivo tumor studies<SEP>All animal experiments were performed under protocols approved by the City of Hope Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For in vivo tumor studies, OVCAR3 and OV90 cells (5.0 × 106) were prepared in a final volume of 500 μl HBSS−/− and engrafted in 6–8 weeks old female NSG mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Tumor growth was monitored at least once a week via biophotonic imaging (Xenogen, LagoX) and flux signals were analyzed with Living Image software (Xenogen). For imaging, mice were i.p. injected with 150 μL D-luciferin potassium salt (Perkin Elmer) suspended in PBS at 4.29 mg/mouse. Once flux signals reached desired levels, day 8 for OV90 and day 14 for OVCAR3, T cells were prepared in 1X PBS, and mice were treated with 500 μL i.p. or 200 μL intravenous (i.v.) injection of 5.0 x 106 Mock or TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells. In the OV90 tumor model, we tested the impact of repeat treatment with i.p. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells starting at day 8, followed by treatments at additional indicated days post-tumor engraftment. Humane endpoints were used in determining survival. Mice were euthanized upon signs of distress such as a distended belly due to ascites, labored or difficulty breathing, apparent weight loss, impaired mobility, or evidence of being moribund. At pre-determined time points or at moribund status, mice were euthanized and tissues and/or ascites fluid were harvested and processed for flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry as described below.<SEP>Peripheral blood was collected from isoflurane-anesthetized mice by retro-orbital (RO) bleed through heparinized capillary tubes (Chase Scientific) into polystyrene tubes containing a heparin/PBS solution (1000 units/mL, Sagent Pharmaceuticals). Volume of each RO blood draw (approximately 120 μL/mouse) was recorded for cell quantification per μL blood. Red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed with 1X Red Cell Lysis Buffer (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol and then washed, stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. Cells from i.p. ascites fluid was collected from euthanized mice by injecting 5 mL cold 1X PBS into the i.p. cavity, which was drawn up via syringe and stored on ice until further processing. RBC-depleted ascites was washed, stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry for tumor-associated glycoprotein expression and CAR T cells using antibodies and methods described above.<SEP>Immunohistochemistry<SEP>Tumor tissue was fixed for up to 3 days in 4% paraformaldehyde (4% PFA, Boston BioProducts) and stored in 70% ethanol until further processing. Immunohistochemistry was performed by the Pathology Core at City of Hope. Briefly, paraffin-embedded sections (10 μm) were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-human CD3 (DAKO), mouse anti-human TAG72 (AB16838, Abcam), rabbit anti-human MUC1 (AB45167, Abcam), MUC16 (AB1107, Abcam). Images were obtained using the Nanozoomer 2.0HT digital slide scanner and the associated NDP.view2 software (Hamamatzu).<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>Data are presented as mean ± SEM, unless otherwise stated. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test to calculate p-value, unless otherwise stated. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; NS, not significant.","Results<SEP>TAG72-CAR T cells containing a 4-1BB intracellular co-stimulatory domain demonstrate in vitro activation against purified TAG72<SEP>Our first goal was to develop a second-generation TAG72-BBζ CAR construct containing the humanized scFv CC49, the human IgG4 Fc extracellular spacer lacking a CH2 domain (ΔCH2), the CD4 transmembrane domain, the 4-1BB intracellular co-stimulatory domain, and the CD3ζ cytolytic domain followed by a truncated CD19 (CD19t) for cell tracking (Figure 1A). We selected this CAR construct based on our recent preclinical investigations demonstrating potent anti-tumor activity of 4-1BB-containing CARs for solid tumors. TAG72-BBζ CAR lentivirus was used to transduce human healthy donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells depleted of CD14+ and CD25+ cells (dPBMC), as previously described. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells were enriched during the manufacturing process (based on CD19t+ selection) and were stably expressed on the surface of T cells (Figure 1B). CAR T cells expanded ex vivo with similar kinetics and comparable CD4:CD8 ratios to Mock (untransduced) T cells (data not shown and Figure 1C). Importantly, and as a first measure of CAR T cell activation against TAG72, we demonstrated dose-dependent CD137 expression on the surface of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells when cultured with plate-bound, but not soluble, purified TAG72 (Figure 1D). Similar dose-dependent induction of cell-surface CD69 expression and IFNγ release was observed with plate-bound TAG72 (Supplemental Figures 1A,B).<SEP>TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells effectively target ovarian cancer cells in vitro<SEP>We next sought to evaluate cell-surface TAG72 expression on human ovarian cancer cell lines, including SKOV3, OVCAR8, COV362.4, OVCAR3, OV90, as well as the TAG72+ colon cancer line, LS174T. Prior studies have demonstrated expression of TAG72 by immunohistochemistry of ovarian tumor patient samples and by western blotting of human ovarian cancer cell lines. By flow cytometry, TAG72 was expressed on OVCAR3 cells (approximately 42%) and to a greater extent on OV90 cells (approximately 90%), with very low levels detected on COV362.4 cells (Figure 2A). TAG72 was absent on SKOV3 and OVCAR8 cells. Immunofluorescence staining of tumor cells confirmed TAG72 expression and cellular localization on the cell surface as well as intracellularly (data not shown). Importantly, we observed higher expression of TAG72 on OVCAR3 and OV90 cells harvested from the ascites of tumor-bearing animals as compared to in vitro cultured cells (Supplemental Figure 2).<SEP>To assess antigen-dependent activity of our TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells, we performed co-cultured assays with TAG72-positive and -negative ovarian tumor targets at an E:T ratio between 1:1 and 1:2 to determine their killing potential. After 24 h, antigen-specific T cell-mediated killing activity was evident with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells relative to Mock T cells (Figure 2B). Amongst TAG72-expressing targets, an average of 59% LS174T, 79% OVCAR3, and 67% OV90 cells were killed. After 72 h, killing of the same tumor lines increased to 77, 90, and 97%, respectively. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells showed minimal killing of TAG72-negative or low expressing SKOV3, OVCAR8, and COV362.4 cells. We further demonstrated the specificity of our TAG72-CAR T cells using a previously described CAR targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) with the same CAR design (Supplemental Figure 3). At 72 h, we observed TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell expansion (2–3 fold) against TAG72-positive tumor cells (Figure 2C). Similar tumor killing was observed at lower E:T ratios of 1:10 (data not shown), demonstrating the potent killing ability of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells. TAG72 is shed from tumor cells in a soluble form, which we showed minimally impacted the tumor killing ability of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (Supplemental Figure 4). We then evaluated cytokine production from CAR T cells as an additional measure of T cell activity. IFNγ and IL-2 cytokine production was observed only when TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells were co-cultured with antigen-positive tumor targets, OVCAR3, LS174T, and OV90 (Figures 2D,E). While IL-2 production peaked at early time points (24 h) and was detectable only against OVCAR3 at later time points (72 h), IFNγ levels were more sustained over 72 h.<SEP>TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells target TAG72-positive cells from ovarian cancer ascites in vitro<SEP>To further confirm TAG72 as an ovarian cancer CAR target and the anti-tumor activity of our TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells, we performed in vitro assays utilizing human ovarian cancer ascites from three patients (OAS3, OAS4, OAS7). Freshly thawed ascites from OAS3, OAS4, and OAS7 expressed 62, 80, and 67% TAG72, respectively, by flow cytometry (data not shown), but after 72 h in culture, was reduced to 2, 53, and 19%, respectively (Figure 2F), likely reflecting an influence of ex vivo culturing conditions on maintenance of TAG72 expression. We then evaluated the cytolytic activity of CAR T cells after 72 h of co-culture with freshly thawed patient primary ovarian cancer ascites, and showed potent and selective CAR-mediated killing of the TAG72-positive OAS4 and OAS7 cells, with no detectable anti-tumor activity against the TAG72-negative OAS3 cells (Figure 2G). TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells produced IFNγ and IL-2 against OAS4, but not OAS3 and OAS7 cells (Figure 2H, Supplemental Figure 5).<SEP>Regional intraperitoneal delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells exhibits potent anti-tumor activity and extends survival in ovarian ascites-bearing mice<SEP>To evaluate the therapeutic potential of our TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in vivo, we first established TAG72+ OVCAR3 tumors in immune compromised NSG mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, to mimic peritoneal ovarian tumors observed in late-stage human disease. OVCAR3 cells were lentivirally transduced to express eGFP/ffluc to allow for tracking of tumor growth via non-invasive optical imaging. At 14 days post-tumor i.p. injection, mice were treated with Mock or TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (5.0 × 106) by systemic intravenous (i.v.) or regional i.p. delivery (Figure 3A). We observed rapid anti-tumor effects in mice treated with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells via regional i.p. delivery, reaching a maximal anti-tumor response 1–2 weeks following treatment (Figures 3B,C). In comparison to regional delivery, i.v. delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells showed limited anti-tumor responses. Anti-tumor responses in mice were durable for 3–4 weeks, but ultimately tumor recurrences were observed in mice. Regional i.p. delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells significantly extended survival of mice, with limited benefits observed by i.v. delivery (Figure 3D).<SEP>To address potential differences observed between i.p. and i.v. therapy, we measured CAR T cells in the blood and ascites of mice. Strikingly, appreciable numbers of CAR T cells (huCD45+CD19t+) were found in the blood of mice 6 days post i.p. treatment, with more than 5-fold fewer CAR T cells in the blood of i.v. treated mice at the same time point (Figure 3E, Supplemental Figure 6). However, we observed equivalent numbers of CAR T cells in the blood of i.p. and i.v. treated mice at later time points, expanding from 1 to 2 weeks, with significant reductions at 4 weeks post-treatment. We then evaluated CAR T cell presence in the ascites of treated mice, and observed CAR T cells at the site of tumors at day 6 post i.p. treatment, with no detectable CAR T cells in i.v. treated mice at the same time point. However, at day 13 post-treatment, similar levels of CAR T cells were observed in mice treated i.v. and i.p. (Figure 3F). These data suggest that CAR T cells eventually reached the tumor following i.v. delivery but with delayed kinetics compared with i.p. delivery, which was likely in part responsible for the lack of observed therapy by this route of administration. CD45-negative cells, likely majority being OVCAR3 tumor cells, were significantly depleted in i.p. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treated mice, but not i.p. or i.v. Mock T cell or i.v. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treated mice. These data support regional intraperitoneal delivery of TAG72-CAR T cells as an effective method of targeting peritoneal ovarian tumors in mice.<SEP>Repeat treatment with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells controls tumor more effectively<SEP>Based on our findings with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in OVCAR3-bearing mice, we next evaluated the OV90 i.p. model, with more uniform TAG72 expression in vitro compared with OVCAR3 (Figure 2A). We first confirmed effectiveness of regional CAR T cell delivery in this model and showed similarly to the OVCAR3 model, i.p., but not i.v. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treatment showed anti-tumor efficacy in the OV90 model (Supplemental Figure 7A). Overall survival was only delayed by approximately 25 days in this model with i.p. delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (Supplemental Figure 7B), likely owing to the aggressive nature of this model. We therefore evaluated whether repeat TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell dosing compared with a single dose improves therapeutic responses (Figure 4A). Compared with a single dose of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells, repeat dosing over the course of 1 month demonstrated more durable anti-tumor responses in the OV90 model (Figures 4B,C). When plotted as relative tumor growth kinetics, repeat dosing promoted more extensive tumor regression as well as more durable control of tumors compared with single dosing (Figure 4D).<SEP>In this study, the overall survival was extended significantly in mice that received repeat doses of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (55 day benefit) compared with a single dose (30 day benefit) (Figure 4E). Greater T cell numbers were observed in peritoneal tumors of mice with repeat treatment (Figure 4F). Importantly, however, we observed reduced numbers, expansion and persistence of CAR T cells in the blood of OV90-bearing mice, compared with the OVCAR3 model (Supplemental Figures 8A,B), suggesting that this more aggressive tumor model may also harbor suppressive mechanisms that hamper T cell function and overall CAR T cell efficacy. Collectively, these data demonstrate potent anti-tumor activity of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in ovarian cancer xenograft models, and also suggest that repeat dosing of regionally delivered CAR T cells may provide greater control of tumors compared with a single dose.<SEP>Tumor recurrences following TAG72-CAR T cell therapy show antigen escape<SEP>One of the major resistance mechanisms to CAR T cell therapy is the tumor antigen heterogeneity that exists in solid tumors that promotes eventual antigen loss or escape. While the loss of CAR T cells in our two models preceded tumor recurrences, we next evaluated expression of TAG72 in tumors from Mock and TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treated mice at various time points pre- and post- therapy. Since TAG72, MUC1, and MUC16 have all been identified as potential targets in ovarian cancer, we first assessed expression of these cell surface antigens on TAG72-negative OVCAR8, and TAG72-positive OVCAR3 and OV90 cells. OVCAR8 appeared to only express low levels of MUC1, and was absent for TAG72 and MUC16, while OVCAR3 expressed all three antigens at varying levels, and OV90 showed low expression of MUC1 and was absent for MUC16 (Figure 5A). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of these antigens in OVCAR3 tumors from mice treated with Mock or TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells. At 12 weeks post T cell infusion, tumors from Mock-treated mice showed heterogeneous expression of TAG72 (similar to flow cytometric analysis of the cell line), MUC16, and MUC1 (Figure 5B). However, tumor recurrences at early time points from mice treated with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells showed a dramatic reduction in TAG72 expression, while maintaining expression of MUC16 and MUC1. Similarly, repeat treatment of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in the OV90 tumor model also showed a reduction in TAG72 expression in early recurrent tumors following treatment (Figure 5C). Interestingly, the expression of TAG72 was detected at high levels in tumor recurrences at later time points, in solid tumors as well as in ascites (Figures 5C,D). We further confirmed this finding in vitro, showing that residual viable OVCAR3 tumor cells remaining after CAR T cell co-culture expressed lower TAG72, but showed typical TAG72 expression levels on tumor cells that grew out in the absence of CAR T cells (Figure 5E). Similar reductions in TAG72 expression were observed with OV90 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that antigen escape plays a key role in tumor recurrences following TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell therapy.","Discussion<SEP>In this study, we evaluated a second-generation TAG72-specific CAR T cell with a 4-1BB intracellular co-stimulatory signaling domain in preclinical models of ovarian cancer. TAG72-CAR T cells demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity against peritoneal ovarian tumors when administered via regional intraperitoneal delivery. While we did not directly compare our CAR construct to first-generation TAG72-CARs, which have been previously published, substantial data in the field now show superiority of CARs containing co-stimulatory domains compared with first-generation CD3ζ-only CARs. Our studies also did not evaluate TAG72-CARs containing CD28 co-stimulation. However, our recent findings with PSCA- and HER2-directed CAR T cells show that while CD28-containing CAR T cells exhibit potent anti-tumor activity in solid tumors, undesirable increases in T cell exhaustion markers, limited persistence, and targeting of tumor cells that express very low levels of antigen may potentiate off-tumor toxicity, compared with 4-1BB-containing CARs. Similar findings have been observed by other groups. In a recent publication detailing the use of TAG72-ζ CAR T cells in the context of colorectal cancer, systemic administration of CAR T cells was well tolerated in patients and demonstrated signs of transient on-target activity. However, limited anti-tumor responses in these patients was in part attributed to a lack of T cell persistence with a first-generation CAR construct lacking co-stimulation. In addition to recent in vitro work that highlight the potential of TAG72-directed CARs with co-stimulation, our current study demonstrates the anti-tumor activity of second-generation humanized TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells using clinically relevant in vivo models of ovarian cancer. While safety of targeting STn antigens (i.e., TAG72) with our CAR T cells was not addressed in the current study, the early clinical experience with first-generation TAG72-CAR T cells, along with recent studies using antibody-drug conjugates in non-human primates provides some evidence of safety in targeting these antigens. Further clinical studies are required to evaluate the safety of these new second-generation TAG72-CAR T cells in patients.<SEP>Recent work by our group and others have suggested that regional administration of CAR T cells may improve CAR T cell therapeutic efficacy in several solid tumor models. Our studies also demonstrate potent anti-tumor activity by regional intraperitoneal administration of TAG72-CAR T cells, compared to limited activity with intravenous delivery, using xenograft models of peritoneal ovarian tumors. In our models, i.v. administered CAR T cells did show trafficking to tumor sites at later time points, however, i.p. administered CAR T cells were observed at tumor sites early following treatment, likely driving more immediate anti-tumor responses, compared with systemic delivery of CAR T cells (Figure 3). Similar findings were observed previously with CAR T cells targeting peritoneal ovarian tumors. We believe that the delayed kinetics in T cell trafficking by i.v. delivery may have insufficiently controlled tumor burden compared with regional delivery, which may be overcome by increasing the dose of i.v. delivered CAR T cells in this model. However, the clinically feasible regional delivery of CAR T cells may provide immediate anti-tumor activity with improved overall therapeutic responses.<SEP>Antigen heterogeneity is a major obstacle to the successful translation of CAR T cell therapies for solid tumors. Expression analysis of MUC1, MUC16, and TAG72 on patient samples from various epithelial subtypes of ovarian cancer highlights antigen heterogeneity in this disease and demonstrates the aberrant expression pattern of cell-surface glycoproteins. Although we show antigen-specific targeting and extended survival of mice treated with our TAG72-CAR T cells using two human xenograft peritoneal ovarian tumor models, tumor recurrences were observed in all treated animals. In both the OVCAR3 and OV90 models, tumor recurrences at early time points following CAR T cell treatment were TAG72 low/negative, but maintained MUC16 and/or MUC1 expression. These findings suggest that multi-targeted CAR T cells approaches, which have been developed as either tandem or dual CAR strategies may provide more durable therapeutic responses in tumors with high antigen heterogeneity. Importantly, CAR T cells have already been developed for both MUC16 and MUC1 including a tumor-specific glycoform, Tn-MUC1, and therefore, further exploitation of these targets for treating advanced ovarian cancer is in order. Unexpectedly, we observed TAG72 expression in tumor recurrences at later time points, suggesting that while early resistance mechanisms to CAR T cell therapy may be driven by reduction in tumor antigen density, the absence of CAR T cell selective pressure may have allowed for TAG72 to be re-expressed at later time points. Possible mechanisms include reduced TAG72 expression by downregulation of the enzyme α2,6-sialyl-transferase, transient internalization of TAG72 following exposure to CAR T cells, and pre-existing tumor cells with lower TAG72 that are not targeted by CAR T cells. Similar reductions in tumor antigen density have been observed in leukemia relapses following CAR T cell therapy. Additional studies are needed in order to gain a more detailed biological understanding of this observation, which may extend to other tumor antigens including those resulting from aberrant glycosylation. Of note, prior studies have demonstrated that type I and II interferons increase the expression of TAG72, which may also be explored in this setting to increase the tumor antigen density for targeting by CAR T cells.<SEP>In the current study, we demonstrated that repeat therapy with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells increased both maximal therapeutic responses as well as disease control in the OV90 model. While we anticipate that eventual antigen escape-dependent tumor recurrences would have been observed even if repeat treatment continued, it is also plausible that a more optimized CAR T cell with increased persistence may obviate need for repeat therapy. It is noteworthy that our TAG72-CAR T cells also showed significant differences in persistence and expansion in the more aggressive OV90 model, when compared with the OVCAR3 model, suggesting that in addition to antigen escape, other mechanisms may also potentially be limiting the durability of the therapy. For instance, reduced in vitro T cell expansion and in vivo T cell persistence against OV90 may also be, in part, due to the lower in vitro IL-2 production upon TAG72-CAR T cell activation. Therefore, increasing T cell persistence in the solid tumor microenvironment is also imperative, and has been demonstrated recently by several groups engineering CAR T cells with additional supportive cytokines. However, as recently reported for other advanced tumors, improved persistence of T cells within ovarian tumors will be likely be achieved in the context of multi-targeted CAR approaches.",36541,['FOODAL']
23932459,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Chronic lower respiratory diseases are the third leading cause of death In the United States, resulting in 137,082 deaths in 2009. Lung function, as assessed by the spirometric measures of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and the FEV1 to FVC ratio (FEV1/FVC), is an objective indicator of general respiratory health, as well as an important long-term predictor of morbidity and mortality. Family- and twin-based studies provide consistent evidence of genetic contributions to lung function, with estimates of heritability ranging as high as 85% for FEV1, 91% for FVC, and 45% for the FEV1/FVC ratio.<SEP>Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to shed light on the complex genetic architecture of lung function measures. Two large meta-analyses of lung function GWAS in subjects of European ancestry who participated in the SpiroMeta or CHARGE consortium reported 11 loci associated with FEV1/FVC or FEV1. A subsequent combined meta-analysis of 48,201 individuals from both consortia reported 16 additional loci influencing lung function. However, variants at these highly significant loci in the SpiroMeta-CHARGE meta-analysis explained only 3.2% of the variance for FEV1/FVC and 1.5% of the variance for FEV1. Thus, similar to studies of other complex phenotypes, a significant proportion of the heritability remains unexplained by individual variants identified in GWAS.<SEP>This missing heritability following GWAS has been attributed to numerous potential causes, many or all of which likely contribute. In particular, the assumptions about the genetic model underlying complex phenotypes that are inherent in standard GWAS approaches may not reflect the true genetic architecture for many phenotypes. GWAS typically assess the effect of each (common) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using stringent thresholds of significance. While this strategy has been effective in minimizing false positive associations and capturing the ‘low hanging fruit’, the inability to identify genetic variation that accounts for significant proportions of human phenotypic variation suggests that alternative analytic strategies are required to differentiate the true from false positive associations among the variants with more modest P-values. For example, considering 294,831 SNPs simultaneously in a linear model, Yang et al. found that common SNPs accounted for as much as 45% of the phenotypic variance and 50% of the heritability of height in 3,925 subjects, compared to only 5% of the variance of height explained by ~50 SNPs that reached genome-wide thresholds of significance in earlier studies.<SEP>Here, we conducted a GWAS of lung function phenotypes in members of a founder population, the Hutterites. In addition to loci reported in previous GWAS, multimarker modeling identified a novel set of airway epithelial cell derived host defense genes.","METHODS<SEP>The Hutterites<SEP>The Hutterites are a young founder population that originated in the South Tyrol in the 16th century and migrated from Europe to the United States in the 1870s. Today more than 40,000 Hutterites live on communal farms (called colonies) in the north central United States and western Canada. We have been conducting genetic studies of complex phenotypes in the Hutterites of South Dakota for over 15 years. Overall, their communal farming lifestyle minimizes environmental heterogeneity. In particular, smoking is prohibited and rare in this population, and air quality is excellent in rural South Dakota (see Table E1 in the Online Repository), eliminating environmental exposures that have profound effects on lung function.<SEP>Subjects were recruited for this study if they were (i) at least 6 years of age, (ii) at home on the days of our visit to their colony, and (iii) able to perform spirometry. Participation rates within each colony are typically around 95%, thus minimizing ascertainment biases that could impact our results. The final sample included 1,180 S-leut Hutterites who live on or were visiting one of 10 South Dakota colonies on the days of our visits; 187 individuals (15.8%) were diagnosed with asthma, as previously defined. These subjects are related to each other through multiple lines of descent in a 3,673-person, 13-generation pedigree with 64 founders. Adult participants provided written informed consent for themselves and their children under 18 years old; participants who were under 18 years old provided written assent. These studies were approved by The University of Chicago Institutional Review Board.<SEP>Measures of lung function<SEP>Spirometry was performed in the Hutterites during two phases of field trips, the first in 1996–1997 and the second in 2006–2009, using identical protocols. Briefly, subjects underwent lung function tests using spirometry in the sitting position while breathing through a mouthpiece and wearing a nose clip in accordance with the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society recommendations73,74. The best FEV1 and FVC were recorded. Of the 1,180 individuals, 335 were studied in phase 1 only, 524 in phase 2 only, and 321 in both phases. For the individuals studied in both phases, we included measurements from the more recent time point only, and excluded 36 individuals (24 used asthma rescue medications before spirometry, 4 had cystic fibrosis, and 8 had poor quality spirometry).<SEP>Genotyping and quality control<SEP>Hutterite individuals were genotyped with the Affymetrix GeneChip 500k, Genome-Wide SNP 5.0, or Genome-Wide SNP 6.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). An overlapping set of 369,487 autosomal SNPs were present on the 500k, 5.0, and 6.0 arrays; 94,552 of those SNPs were not studied because they were monomorphic (n = 31,246) or had minor allele frequency < 5% (n = 63,306) in the Hutterites. Of the remaining 274,935 SNPs, 28,925 were excluded because they had call rates < 95% (n = 6,456), generated ≥5 Mendelian errors (n = 15,912), or deviated from Hardy-Weinberg expectations at P < 10−3 (correcting for inbreeding and relatedness) (n = 6,557), yielding a final set of 246,010 autosomal markers with a median inter-marker spacing of 5.1 kb. The positions of SNPs shown in all figures and tables are based on NCBI release 36 (dbSNP build 129).<SEP>Heritability estimates and GWAS in the Hutterites<SEP>FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC were transformed to normally distributed z-scores within each phase, and then adjusted for age, sex, age*sex, height, and inbreeding. The residuals of each trait from the two phases were then combined for further analyses. The distributions of these traits by age and sex and the correlations between them are shown in Fig. E1 in the Online Repository. The heritabilities of lung function measures were estimated using variance-component methods, as previously described. Association testing was performed using a regression-based test for large, complex pedigrees. Briefly, at each SNP, we used the general two-allele model (GTAM) test of association in the entire pedigree, keeping all inbreeding loops intact; at each SNP we tested an additive model of association. SNP-specific P-values were determined based on Gaussian theory. Genomic inflation was weak or absent (genomic inflation factor λ= 1.10 for FEV1, 1.09 for FVC, and 1.00 for FEV1/FVC). The GWAS P-values for FEV1 and FVC were adjusted using their genomic control. The Bonferroni corrected genome-wide significance threshold was P < 2.0 x 10−7 (i.e., 0.05/246,010). The proportion of the residual variance explained by each SNP or a group of SNPs was determined by comparing the (RSS) in the regression model to that obtained without a SNP (or a group of SNPs), as implemented in GTAM.<SEP>In silico replication<SEP>We performed in silico replication of the GWAS results in the Hutterites using available results from the recently published meta-analysis in subjects of European descent in the SpiroMeta (n=20,288) and CHARGE (n=20,890) consortia. In addition, we investigated in the Hutterites the associations between lung function measures and SNPs at the 27 previously identified lung function associated loci. For the latter, we reported the most significant SNP within 20 kb of the 27 previously reported loci.<SEP>Multimarker modeling<SEP>To select the minimum set of SNPs that best predict FEV1/FVC in the Hutterites from among SNPs with P < 10−3 in the GWAS, we performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) regression, as implemented in the R package glmnet. These studies were conducted in 604 Hutterites without missing genotypes at all 312 SNPs with P < 10−3 (87 SNPs had missing data in at least one individual and were not included in the LASSO regression). Of the 540 subjects that were missing genotypes in these SNPs and not included in the LASSO regression, 261 had no missing genotypes in the 80 SNPs selected by LASSO and were used in subsequent analyses. The minimum set of best predicting SNPs was selected by running a 10-fold cross-validation procedure after choosing the glmnet parameter α= 1.0. The cross-validation procedure selected a LASSO penalty parameter of λ = 3.3 x 10−3 . K-fold cross validation was used to minimize the effects of overfitting the model to our data by randomly dividing the full data set into K-subsamples where K-1 subsamples are used to develop the model and the remaining subsample used for testing the model. LASSO regression uses SNPs as predictors of the phenotype (FEV1/FVC), while minimizing the number of SNPs in the model. Genotypes were coded as 0, 1, 2 doses of the minor allele. Following the 10-fold cross-validation procedure the LASSO regression selected 108 SNPs in the model. However, 28 of these SNPs had negligible effect sizes (absolute value of fixed effect size < .005) and were removed from the model, resulting in a final set of 80 SNPs.<SEP>Identifying related sets of genes<SEP>To identify related sets of genes and common pathways for genes near the SNPs that best predicted FEV1/FVC, we used the GRAIL algorithm to mine the Gene Ontology database. Briefly, GRAIL assesses the degree of relatedness among genes within regions harboring predictive SNPs, selecting the most connected gene that corresponds to one or more SNPs as the likely implicated gene. GRAIL assigns a P-value for each region that reflects the relatedness of the gene(s) in each region to all other regions, correcting for the number of genes in the region.","RESULTS<SEP>A total of 1,144 Hutterites (613 females, 53.6%) aged 6–89 years (mean ± SD, 30.6 ± 18.4 years) with both genome-wide genotyping and spirometry phenotypes were included in the GWAS (Table 1). These same data are shown for the non-asthmatic and asthmatic sample subsets in Table E2 in the Online Repository.<SEP>Heritability of lung function in the Hutterites<SEP>The broad (H2) and narrow (h2) heritabilities of lung function measures in the Hutterites were h2 = H2 = 40.2% (SE 5.4%) for FEV1, h2 = 17.8% (SE 3.7%) and H2 = 70.4% (SE 11.2%) for FVC, and h2 = 22.1% (SE 8.0%) and H2 = 91.5% (SE 12.9%) for FEV1/FVC. These estimates indicate that 40.2%, 70.4%, and 91.5% of the phenotypic variances in FEV1, FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio, respectively, are attributable to genetic variation in the Hutterites. The heritabilities of FVC and FEV1/FVC included both additive and non-additive (i.e., dominance) genetic variance components, whereas the heritability of FEV1 was comprised entirely of additive genetic variance.<SEP>GWAS of lung function traits<SEP>We identified genome-wide significant associations between FEV1/FVC and five SNPs at the THSD4-UACA-TLE3 locus on chromosome 15q23 (see Fig. E2a in the Online Repository), replicating results from previous GWAS. Overall, there were 21 SNPs at this locus with P < 10−5 (see Table E3 in the Online Repository). The most significant SNP at this locus, rs12441227, explained 2.9% of the residual variance in FEV1/FVC in the Hutterites. The evidence for association with SNPs at this locus remained when the individuals with asthma were excluded (Fig. E2d), and when the sample was stratified by age (Table E4).<SEP>Nine additional SNPs at four loci had P-values < 10−5 with FEV1/FVC, including SNPs downstream of the C10orf11 gene on chromosome 10q22.3, which was associated with FEV1 in a meta-analysis of lung function GWAS. When a sub-analysis was performed excluding the Hutterites with asthma, the evidence for association at this locus increased to genome-wide levels of significance (Table E4, Fig. E2f) The evidence for associations with SNPs at three of these loci with P-values < 10−5, CCL23-CCL18 on chromosome 17q12 (Fig. E2b and E2e), PITPNC1 locus on chromosome 17q24.2, and CHAF1B on chromosome 21q22.13, remained in sub-analyses excluding asthmatics. The evidence for association at all locus with P-values < 10−5 was present in subset analyses stratified by age (Table E4). Only two SNPs had P-values < 10−5 in the GWAS for the other two phenotypes: one SNP 7k downstream of the IL37 gene on chromosome 2q13 was associated with FEV1 and one SNP in an intron of ASXL3 on chromosome 18q12.1 was associated with FVC.<SEP>The Manhattan and Q-Q plots of P-values for the GWAS of the three phenotypes are shown in Fig. 1; results for all SNPs with P < 10−5 are shown in Table E3 in the Online Repository. The GWAS P-values in the Hutterites for the 27 loci associated with lung function in previous meta-analyses are shown in Table E5 in the Online Repository. Overall, we found nominal evidence (P < 0.05) of association with at least one of the three phenotypes for 14 SNPs at 9 of the 27 previously reported loci; and five SNPs at an additional five previously reported loci were associated with at least one of the three phenotypes at P < 0.01.<SEP>Multimarker modeling<SEP>We assumed that there were additional true associations among the GWAS SNPs that did not reach genome-wide levels of significance because their effects are too small to detect in single SNP analyses, especially in a sample size of ~1,000 subjects. Therefore, to assess a multimarker model of risk including all SNPs with P < 10−3, we performed LASSO regression to identify minimum sets of SNPs that provided the smallest mean square error of FEV1/FVC in the Hutterites. A set of 80 SNPs yielded the best predictive value and were used for further study (see Table E6 in the Online Repository).<SEP>First, we assessed the phenotypic effects of these 80 SNPs by binning individuals by the total number of alleles associated with reduced FEV1/FVC that they carried (total possible = 160) and calculated the mean (SE) residual FEV1/FVC for Hutterites in each bin. The mean residual FEV1/FVC decreased with increasing number of ‘low FEV1/FVC alleles’, consistent with an additive genetic architecture (Fig. 2).<SEP>Next, we used the GRAIL algorithm to mine the Gene Ontology database for evidence of functional connections between genes near the 80 predictive SNPs. We identified a subset of six SNPs with significantly related genes (GRAIL P < 0.05), including three clusters of β-defensin genes, two chemokine genes (CCL18 and CXCL12), and TNFRSF13B (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Notably, the associated GWAS SNPs at two replicated loci, THSD4-UACA-TLE3 and C10orf11, were not functionally connected to any other genes defined by the 80 SNPs. However, a SNP at the CCL23-CCL18 locus, the second most significant locus in the Hutterite GWAS (see Fig. E3b in the Online Repository), was significantly connected to the β-defensin genes, as well as to CXCL12 and TNFRSF13B in the GRAIL analysis. These six SNPs by themselves explained 5.8% of the residual variance in FEV1/FVC in the Hutterites.","DISCUSSION<SEP>The success of GWAS for unraveling the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes has been widely debated. While there have been many robust associations discovered for a wide spectrum of diseases and phenotypes, the associated variants typically explain relatively little of the phenotypic variation. Several recent studies have highlighted the importance of approaches that consider multiple variants simultaneously, a more suitable approach if the genetic architecture of common phenotypes is polygenic with many contributing loci with small effects. However, the best way to identify multiple contributing loci is at present unclear.<SEP>The GWAS of the FEV1/FVC ratio in the Hutterites revealed two previously reported associations with measures of lung function. Associations with multiple SNPs at the highly replicated locus on 15q23 reached genome-wide significance in the combined sample, and SNPs at the C10orf11 on chromosome 10q22.3 reached genome-wide significance in the non-asthmatic subset of the Hutterite sample. These results were robust to age, with evidence for association present in both the child and adult subsets of the population. Moreover, we detected nominal levels of significance with SNPs at 9 previously reported loci associated with lung function measures. Together, these results indicate that genes influencing lung function in Europeans and European Americans from the general population also contribute to lung function phenotypes in the Hutterites.<SEP>To assess the combined effects of these and other SNPs with less significant evidence of association, we used LASSO regression to select the minimum set of SNPs from among the 312 with P-values < 10−3. The LASSO regression selected 80 independent SNPs as the best predictor of the FEV1/FVC ratio. Consistent with an additive genetic model, the mean phenotypic value decreases with increasing number of “risk” alleles (Fig. 2). Moreover, this approach led to the discovery of additional genes, including three independent clusters of β-defensin genes, two chemokine genes, and a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family receptor, suggesting an important link between host defense mechanisms and lung function. Defensins are antimicrobial peptides that recruit inflammatory cells and modulate innate and adaptive immune responses, participating in both the promotion and resolution of inflammatory responses. There are three classes of defensins, but only the β-defensins are specifically expressed in epithelial cells, including those lining the respiratory tract. Genetic studies have implicated the β-defensin genes on chromosome 8p23 in lung function in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and with cystic fibrosis (CF). In particular, DEFB1 mRNA in bronchial epithelial cell biopsies was significantly elevated in COPD patients compared to controls and significantly associated with both reduced FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio in COPD patients and controls. The results of our studies would further suggest that all three clusters of β-defensin genes on chromosomes 8p23, 20p13, and 20q11 contribute to lung function in healthy, unselected subjects. Chemokines are small proteins that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors and orchestrate the migration of circulating leukocytes to sites of inflammation. CCL18 (also named PARC, pulmonary and activated-regulated cytokine) is constitutively and highly expressed in the human lung, and can generate regulatory T cells from CD4+CD25− T cells in healthy individuals via direct induction of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). Functional polymorphisms in the promoter of the TGFB1 gene have been associated with airway responsiveness and asthma exacerbations, and haplotypes comprised of polymorphisms and specific coding variants in this gene have been associated with lung function in CF patients, although the exact variants and direction of effect are inconsistent across studies. Moreover, both β-defensin-2 and CCL18 were significantly elevated in peripheral blood from COPD patients compared to smoking and non-smoking controls, CXCL12 (also name SDF-1, stromal derived growth factor 1) is critical to bone marrow-derived stem cell production, and shows increased expression in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid after bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in a murine model, and in airway tissues in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared to controls. The TNFRSF13B gene encodes the transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), which binds two ligands, BAFF (B-cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferating-inducing ligand). It is thought that TACI plays a key role in B cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells. In a recent study, rare mutations in TNFRSF13B were associated with asthma symptoms in Swedish children. Moreover, BAFF expression in alveolar macrophages was inversely correlated with lung function in COPD patients. Our study extends the roles of these two chemokines and TNF-family receptor to inter-individual variability in normal lung function.<SEP>Despite conducting this study in a relatively small sample (~1,000 Hutterites) and the absence of a major locus influencing variation in lung function compared to other traits (for examples, see references), we were successful in identifying both genome-wide significant associations with replicated loci on chromosome 15 in the combined sample and on chromosome 10 in the non-asthmatic subset, in addition to a set of novel variants that are highly predictive for lung function in the Hutterites. The power of our study was likely enhanced by the homogeneity of the Hutterite population compared to the larger population samples that have been included in previous studies of lung function. The advantages of this population for genetic studies of complex phenotypes are primarily two-fold. On the one hand, it is possible that there are fewer lung function-associated alleles segregating in the Hutterites due to the population bottleneck that occurred prior to their emigration to the United States. This would result in a simpler genetic architecture due to both overall reduced genetic variation and increased frequencies of some variants with potentially larger phenotypic effects that are rare in other European populations. On the other hand, their communal lifestyle and shared environmental exposures, which include the absence of exposure to cigarette smoke and air pollution, may have enhanced the effects of genetic variation in general, and on specific pathways in particular, on lung development and subsequent lung function. In this population, exposures are remarkably similar during critical periods of lung development both in utero and in early life. Hutterite women and young children are not directly involved in farming activities, and their homes are generally distant from the agricultural fields and animal barns. Meals are prepared in a communal kitchen, using traditional recipes that are shared among the colonies. There are no pets, televisions, radios, or computers in the homes, and, as a result, Hutterite children spend significant proportions of each day playing outside. Thus, the absence of important environmental exposures that impact lung development and lung function, combined with a shared environment throughout life, not only reduces non-genetic heterogeneity but also allows for the detection of lung function alleles that are not confounded with those related to socioeconomic factors or behavior, such as cigarette smoking, or to ecogenetic pathways that are important in metabolizing inhaled particles. These population characteristics possibly enabled the novel finding in this study of an enrichment of genes involved in anti-microbial immunity in the airways among those associated with lung function.<SEP>In summary, this study identifies genome-wide significant associations between lung function and SNPs at the THSD4-UACA-TLE3 locus on chromosome 15q23 and the C10orf11 on chromosome 10, and replicates many other previous GWAS results. Moreover, using LASSO regression, we identified 80 independent SNPs as the best predictor of the FEV1/FVC ratio, with the mean phenotypic value decreases with increasing number of “risk” alleles, consistent with an additive genetic architecture. Of note is that multimarker modeling implicated for the first time common variation in three independent clusters of β-defensin genes, two chemokine genes, and a TNF family receptor that involved in anti-microbial immunity in airway mucosa influences lung function.",24381,['FOODAL']
28642883,"1. Introduction<SEP>Autoimmune diseases are resulted from the dysfunction of the immune system, which generate immune response to autoantigens. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is one kind of specific autoimmune diseases, which can cause progression of fibrosis and cirrhosis in the liver and lead to liver failure finally. There are still no special treatments for primary biliary cholangitis in the world. At present, the most efficient therapy is to use ursodeoxycholic acid for those who are in early period of primary biliary cholangitis. However, ursodeoxycholic acid could not still stop the progression of the disease. When the final stage of PBC occurred, the only therapy is liver transplantation. Up to now, the definite etiology of PBC is still not clear.<SEP>Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) is expressed on the surface of activated T and transmits inhibitory signal, and it is also found on the surface of regulatory T cells. The functions of CTLA4 are to lower responses of T cell and maintain peripheral tolerance of T cell. The abnormal costimulation between specific autoreactive T lymphocytes and CTLA4 in PBC patients causes the reaction of peripheral T lymphocyte not to be terminated, which might be one of the pathogens of PBC.<SEP>As to PBC, CD8+ T cells are important factors in the pathogenesis. CD8+ T cells are sensitive to E2 components of pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (PDC-E2) which are abnormally expressed on the surface of biliary epithelial cells (BECs) and would result in apoptosis for these epithelial cells and destruction of the small bile duct. As a coinhibitor signal, CTLA4 binds to CD80/CD86 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with higher affinity comparing with CD28. Binding with CD80/CD86 to deliver negative signal into T cells, CTLA4 can result T cell responses in inhibition or termination. Then, CTLA4 can regulate immune suppression and peripheral tolerance in CD8+ T cells. Thus, CTLA4 could be involved in the regulation of pathological processes of PBC, which might be a therapeutic for PBC. Two studies demonstrated that treatment with CTLA4-Ig, which can reduce self-reactive T cell activation and liver inflammation significantly, could obviously reduce the level of portal inflammation and biliary cell damage in the mouse model.<SEP>So, CTLA4 regulation plays an important role in the pathological process of PBC. Meanwhile, the results, which were shown in some researches about the treatment of CTLA4, have shown that CTLA4 plays a unique role in the pathogenesis and treatment of PBC.<SEP>Recently, genetic factors are deemed to be an important role in PBC, which is mainly in favor of familial clustering of PBC. Recent study showed that PBC was significantly associated with some concrete gene polymorphisms. Since PBC displays characteristics of autoimmunity, more and more studies concentrated in associations between genetic polymorphism and variations of autoimmunity.<SEP>There are several evidences to prove the connections between polymorphisms of CTLA4 and other autoimmune diseases in recent literatures. In recent years, there are extensive researches about the links between CTLA4 and PBC. rs231775, rs231775, rs3087243, and rs5742909 are the most common four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be widely studied. Thus, with changes of the function in these SNPs, the possibility of PBC might be increased. Because of inconclusive connections between the polymorphisms of CTLA4 and the risks of PBC, those relative researches are necessary to be combined to conduct a meta-analysis. Several early systematic reviews which had been published mainly regarded the relationships between the polymorphisms in several SNPs and primary biliary cholangitis. However, these studies either did not draw the clear conclusion or did not include some latest literatures. So, in this research, 16 studies are combined to analyze the correlation between the polymorphisms of CTLA4 and risks of PBC.","2. Materials and Methods<SEP>2.1. Study Selection and Data Extraction<SEP>We used PubMed and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated database up to June 2016, and related literatures about the relationships between the polymorphisms of CTLA4 and risks of PBC were researched on computer with retrieval words (“primary biliary cholangitis, PBC, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, Polymorphism, SNP, genetic variants”). At last, we found 26 studies contained relative contents about CTLA4 and PBC.<SEP>The following conditions should be met in studies: firstly, literature should be a case-control study; secondly, outcome was about primary biliary cholangitis; and thirdly, odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval should be estimated with adequate data in literatures. Exclusive criteria: insufficient information for data extraction. At last, this meta-analysis included 16 literatures after 10 literatures were excluded.<SEP>According to the inclusion conditions mentioned above, two researchers extracted data independently. The researchers gathered these data from each study: SNPs, name of the first author, date of publication, ethnicity, number of allele, and genotype. Diversities among researchers were solved with discussion.<SEP>3. Statistical Analysis<SEP>The intensity of associations between PBC risk and CTLA4 polymorphisms was assessed in a random-effect model or fixed-effect model by the estimated OR and its 95%CI. Assessing the difference between the CTLA4 polymorphisms and the PBC risk in Caucasian and Asian was also conducted by using subgroup analyzing. Z-test was used to compute the significant difference of pooled OR. The p value of Z-test was calculated to access significance. Because multiple comparisons were conducted in this study, the threshold of p values was corrected with formula 1 − (1 − p)1/n for the Bonferroni correction. Q-test was used to assess heterogeneity and calculate I2 statistic. When p was less than 0.05 or I2 was more than 50%, the results among the studies indicated significant heterogeneity. In addition, possible publication biases were estimated by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression; p value was calculated to access bias. When p was less than 0.05, a publication bias was considered to be existence. The validity and reliability of a meta-analysis were evaluated by conducting sensitivity analysis. All the statistics were performed by STATA 14 software.<SEP>In this study, linkage disequilibrium (LD) was used to measure the association among these four CTLA4 SNPs after multiple comparison. The values of D' and r2 were calculated by SHEsis software (http://analysis.bio-x.cn/myAnalysis.php). When D' > 0.8 or r2 > 0.4, linkage disequilibrium could be considered.","4. Results<SEP>4.1. Literature Search<SEP>In total, the number of cases and controls were 4422 and 5210 in 16 studies, respectively (Table 1). As to CTLA4, the SNPs which were mostly consulted were rs231775, rs231725, rs3087243, and rs5742909. These SNPs were reported in 14, 6, 9, and 5 studies, respectively. The genotypes of controls were in line with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in most articles.<SEP>4.2. Meta-Analysis<SEP>Obvious heterogeneity was identified in CTLA4 rs231775 polymorphism (G versus A: P(het) = 0.008, I2 = 54.1%; GG versus AA: P(het) = 0.032, I2 = 45.6%), rs3087243 polymorphism (GA versus GG: P(het) = 0.028, I2 = 53.5%; AA + GA versus GG: P(het) = 0.037, I2 = 51.2%), and rs5742909 polymorphism (T versus C: P(het) = 0.001, I2 = 69.4%; TC versus CC: P(het) = 0.01, I2 = 66.7%; and (TT + TC) versus CC: P(het) = 0.007, I2 = 69%). Therefore, we chose the random-effect model to generate extensive CIs in these genetic models, the rest of genetic models were used the fixed-effects model (Table 2).<SEP>The results of this analysis in the association of CTLA4 polymorphisms (rs231775, rs231725, rs3087243, and rs5742909) with susceptibility to PBC are presented (Table 3).<SEP>The study identified that rs231775 polymorphism of CTLA4 was significantly associated with PBC susceptibility. The ORs (95%CIs) of G versus A, GG versus AA, GA versus AA, (GG + GA) versus AA, and GG versus (AA + GA) were 1.32 (1.19–1.47), 1.72 (1.37–2.16), 1.27 (1.13–1.43), 1.38 (1.23–1.54), and 1.52 (1.35–1.71), respectively. As to each model, the p value was below 0.0001 (Figure 1). The rs231725 polymorphism also showed significant association with PBC susceptibility. The ORs with 95%CIs of A versus G, AA versus GG, GA versus GG, (AA + GA) versus GG, and AA versus (GG + GA) were 1.33 (1.22–1.45), 1.83 (1.52–2.21), 1.20 (1.04–1.38), 1.34 (1.17–1.53), and 1.57 (1.35–1.82), respectively. As to each genetic model, the p value was below 0.05 (Figure 2). Nevertheless, no association was identified between rs3087243 (Figure 3) and rs5742909 (Figure 4) polymorphisms and PBC susceptibility. Subgroup analysis showed that both rs231775 and rs231725 showed significant association with PBC susceptibility for Asians and for Caucasians.<SEP>4.3. Calculation of Linkage Disequilibrium<SEP>Based on the values of r2, there was no obviously linkage disequilibrium among four SNPs (Table 4).<SEP>4.4. Sensitivity Analyses and Publication Bias<SEP>Sensitivity analysis was conducted by omitting each studies sequentially, suggesting that the results for the overall population were statistically stable and reliable (Figure 5). Publication bias was examined by using Egger's regression and Begg's funnel plot in our research. No obvious publication bias was identified. For Begg's test, p values of rs231775 (G versus A), rs231725 (A versus G), rs3087243 (A versus G), and rs5742909 (T versus C) were 0.661, 0.806, 0.466, and 0.060, respectively. For Egger's test, p values of genetic models mentioned above were 0.952, 0.186, 0.061, and 0.029, respectively (Figure 6).","5. Discussion<SEP>Multiple comparisons were conducted in this study. To minimize the type I error, the threshold of p values was corrected by the Bonferroni correction. The Bonferroni correction compensates for that increase by testing each individual hypothesis at a significance level. Then, the threshold of p value for the Bonferroni correction can be calculated with the corresponding critical values 1 − (1 − p)1/n. There are four SNPs in this study for multiple comparisons, and the original threshold of p value was 0.05. So, after calculating with above formula (p = 0.05, n = 4), p < 0.0127 was considered statistically significant.<SEP>As to the polymorphisms of rs231775 and rs231725, significant connections were found to be associated with PBC in all 5 genetic models. For patients in cases, the frequencies of allele and genotype in rs231775 and rs231725 were increased more significantly than those in controls. As to allele, the results of rs231775 were similar to the results of five published meta-analyses by Eskandari-Nasab et al., Huang et al., Miyake et al., Li et al., and Chen et al.. Li and Miyake indicated that the G allele might be connected with PBC as a risk factor. On the contrary, meta-analyses from Chen and Huang proposed that the relationship between G allele and susceptibility of PBC was observed only in Asian.<SEP>As to rs3087243, our analysis showed that both allele and genotype were negative associations with PBC in overall populations. For rs5742909, in codominant, dominant, and recessive models, there were no connections with susceptibility of PBC in Caucasian and Asian. These results were consistent with those in one meta-analysis, which was conducted by Li et al., including 12 studies.<SEP>Through subgroup analysis, GG homozygosity of rs231775 and AA homozygosity of rs231725 were associated with the susceptibility to PBC both in Asians and in Caucasians. AA homozygosity of rs3087243 was protective against PBC in Asians and Caucasians. On the other hand, GA heterozygosity of rs231725 was associated with the susceptibility to PBC in Asians although it was not in Caucasians. GA heterozygosity of rs3087243 was protective against PBC in Asians although it was not in Caucasians. Thus, there may be a little different between Asians and Caucasians in the relationship between SNP polymorphism of CTLA4 and the susceptibility to PBC. In order to solve these problems, further studies in various ethnicities are required.<SEP>In linkage disequilibrium, coefficients D' and r2 were frequently used. They have quite different characteristics and could be applied for different purposes. Typically, r2 is useful in the context of association studies, D' is the measure of choice to assess recombination patterns in a given population. It is indicated that the two loci were not recombined and were in a complete linkage disequilibrium when the value of D' is 1. But the significance of values would be difficult to interpret when D' < 1. Meanwhile, when the sample size is small and the frequency of SNPs is low, the estimate of D' would be too large. In this case, even the sites of linkage equilibrium can get larger D' value, the actual meaning of the D' could easily be exaggerated. Then, the value of r2 could be more reliable under this condition. In this study, the frequency of genotypes in rs5742909 was much lower than the others (Table 1). Thus, the values of D' were much larger than the value of r2. So, r2 was chosen to assess the linkage disequilibrium. Based on the results, LD was not observed among four SNPs.<SEP>Heterogeneity may affect pooled results as one of possible factors. It can be categorized into heterogeneity of the genetic model and effect. In this study, a relatively moderate heterogeneity was heeded. Among 16 studies, HWE values of five studies were out. As to rs231775 and rs5742909, there were three and two studies to be out of HWE, respectively. Thus, we conducted the sensitivity analysis in all studies. In the analysis of rs231775, the results of I2values reduced when we removed the article by Li et al.. The heterogeneity in Caucasians was larger than in Asians. This study showed that diversity of genetic ethnicities or methodological differences might be the sources of heterogeneity.<SEP>There are some characteristics in this meta-analysis. Comparing with other similar articles, we conducted four SNPs in one study, and each SNP included five different genetic models. We assessed subgroup by analyzing ethnicities and obtained more precise estimation of the relationships. We also performed sensitivity analysis to test the validity of the results.<SEP>To date, several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genome-wide meta-analysis on PBC have been performed. From these literatures, there were several genes to be identified as significant susceptibility loci for PBC. There were ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility loci such as TNFSF15, POU2AF1, IL12A, and IL12RB2 and common pathogenic pathways such as B cell differentiation, IL-12 signaling, and T cell activation.<SEP>As to GWAS, the relationship between mutations of SNPs and occurrence of disease might not be a necessity but a probability. So, a large number of samples should be analyzed for the association study between gene and disease. The number of cases which were enrolled in each publication of genome-wide association study of PBC was not enough comparing with the probability of gene mutation. Thus, some higher risk loci with lower mutation frequency could be concealed by lower risk loci with higher mutation frequency. Meanwhile, it was different from the GWAS that focused on the onset of disease, and the data of our meta-analysis might provide a point in the search for novel therapies that are urgently needed to improve outcomes for PBC patients.<SEP>On the one hand, GWAS efforts have focused on the identification of association of genetic variants with PBC, but not with specific properties of disease such as response of treatment. As mentioned, the IL-12 pathway has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of PBC. The monoclonal antibody took the IL-12p40 subunit as the target and exerted its effect on both the IL-12/TH1 and IL-23/TH17 axes. While the monoclonal antibody has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in patients with Crohn's disease and psoriasis, none of the patients achieved the predefined primary endpoint of alkaline phosphatase reduction from baseline. Although, the data of CTLA4 polymorphism and the association between CTLA4 and PBC were not reported in the GWAS of PBC, CTLA4 was the main focus of PBC in many candidate gene studies, and certain benefit results were obtained as a therapeutic target from CTLA4. CTLA4-Ig has been developed as an exciting outcome in mouse model of PBC. Based on these studies, a new clinical study has been set to determine the effect of abatacept in PBC patients who have no response to UDCA (NCT02078882).<SEP>On the other hand, IL-12 signal pathway may be an important role for PBC through Th1/2 differentiation among these loci from GWAS, but CTLA4 could also impact Th1/2. Indeed, CTLA4-deficient mice and T cells were shown to be strongly trend a Th2 phenotype. This is the control of Th1/Th2 differentiation, which was shown to depend both on the cytokine microenvironment and costimulatory signals. It is evidenced that some gene loci could be potential risk for PBC in GWAS, but these findings still have not translated into clinic. Although, the polymorphism of CTLA4 could not be improved in GWAS, as to biliary cell damages in PBC, CTLA4 could influence the effect of these inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, and IL-23.<SEP>In view of the publication of the GWAS of PBC, our meta-analysis might be quite basic. However, we have collected sufficient documentations that have ever been published and analyzed four SNPs of CTLA4 that have ever been reported in the publication of candidate gene studies. It should be said that this study was a more comprehensive meta-analysis of association between CTLA4 and PBC. Our findings might illustrate that relevant research could still be gained from the candidate gene investigation.<SEP>In this meta-analysis, there were still some limitations to be existed. First, except race, there were other factors to be concerned, which included age, gender, and alcohol habit. It would be useful to understand that different risk factors might interact with the development of PBC as genetic variations. Secondly, some studies suggested that patients in PBC would also suffer other autoimmune diseases. Since, these literatures which we included did not mention whether other diseases were excluded in those patients, these situations may introduce errors during analyzing.<SEP>To sum up, this meta-analysis showed that the GG, GA genotype, and G allele of rs231775 and AA, GA genotype, and A allele of rs231725 in CTLA4 may be risk factors for PBC in Asians and Caucasians. AA, GA genotype, and A allele of rs3087243 may be negatively associated with PBC in overall populations, especially in Asian. There was no significant connection with PBC in rs5742909 of CTLA4. Not only the impact on cytokine regulation but also the benefit results as therapeutic target, to some extent, CTLA4 still plays a role which could not be completely ignored in PBC.",19164,['FOODAL']
28248954,"Introduction<SEP>T cells are essential elements of the adaptive immune response. CD4+ T cells, together with an appropriate cytokine environment, are required for the activation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells that mediate defense and pathogen clearance during various infections. The role of CD4+ T cells is also necessary for B cells and macrophages to execute their protective functions.<SEP>T cells are activated and start to differentiate in response to complex stimuli involving cytokines, membrane receptors and transcription factors. Signaling through T cell receptor and costimulatory molecules induces their rapid proliferation and clonal expansion, and differentiation into effector and memory T cell subtypes. Faulty activation or inadequate regulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may contribute to the initiation and progression of multiple autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, as well as allergy and asthma. In addition, a distinct lineage of CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells, have a central role in the control of the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.<SEP>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with various immune related diseases. Studies of the consequences of the risk alleles in biologically relevant contexts for different diseases have stressed the importance of the tissue and cell type-specificity of the regulatory variants. We have recently shown that by mapping eQTLs in a sufficiently large sample set, it is possible to identify cell type-specific effects in whole blood, but the challenge to distinguish the cells responsible for the associations remains. The power of studying expression-associated genetic variants in purified cells types has now been illustrated for B cells, monocytes, neutrophils, T regulatory cells and CD4+ T cells, which allowed the identification of functional roles for several polymorphisms at autoimmune and even neurodegenerative disease loci. Meanwhile, some particularly interesting cis- and trans-eQTLs identified in whole blood could not be attributed to these cell types, and require an expanded survey of cells involved in immune response.<SEP>To this end, we purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the peripheral blood of 313 healthy individuals for genome-wide mapping of genetic variation affecting the expression of genes involved in immune response. Our analysis characterizes both the extent of genetic control of gene expression in T cells and its cellular specificity, as well as variation in isoform levels of genes and their association with epigenetic changes. We show that integrating knowledge from GWAS with eQTLs enables us to clarify the functional consequences of disease-associated variants and assess the enrichment of autoimmune response. Finally, we highlight a common T1D-associated missense variant in IL27 affecting the STAT1 and IRF1 pathway in CD4+ T cells. Our analysis provides insights into the basic processes of the regulation of gene expression in T cells and advances our understanding about the pathways involved with disease susceptibility in the adaptive immune system.","Materials and methods<SEP>Study design<SEP>The aims of this study were to perform cis- and trans-eQTL mapping in purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and evaluate their pathogenic implications for autoimmune mechanisms. Based on similar studies, we considered the sample size of 300 individuals to be sufficient to ensure statistical power to detect eQTL effects in purified cells. This study participants were healthy donors of the Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu. In total, 313 subjects were selected for the study, with median age 54 (standard deviation 17.8), 154 females and 159 males. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Human Research of the University of Tartu, Estonia (permission no 206/T-4, date of issue 25.08.2011) and it was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. A written informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from each individual prior to recruitment. All methods were carried out in accordance with approved guidelines.<SEP>DNA from the samples were genotyped using HumanOmniExpress BeadChips (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We imputed both datasets using the 1000 Genomes project reference by using IMPUTE v2, resulting in 5,879,386 autosomal SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of > 0.05 for downstream analyses. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by consecutive positive separation using microbeads (CD4+ #130-045-101; CD8+ #130-045-201) and AutoMACS technology (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression data was generated using HumanHT-12v4 BeadChips (Illumina), according to the standard protocol. Preprocessing and quality control of the data was done using R and the Bioconductor packages lumi and arrayQualityMetrics. The number of samples retained for further analysis was 293 for CD4+ and 283 for CD8+ T cells, 303 unique individuals. The effect of the mutant and wild-type IL27 was experimentally tested in HEK 293 cells. The procedures are described in details in the S1 File.<SEP>Cis- and trans-eQTL mapping<SEP>The effects of SNPs on local (cis-eQTL) and distant (trans-eQTL) genes were determined via eQTL mapping as described in eQTL mapping analysis cookbook developed by the University Medical Center Groningen at the Genetics Department and the Genomics Coordination Center (https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/wiki/eQTL-mapping-analysis-cookbook) and previously in. For cis-analysis the distance between the probe midpoint and SNP genomic location was up to 1 Mb and for trans-analysis the distance was more than 5 Mb or the probe and SNP were on different chromosomes. Only SNPs with a MAF > 0.05, call rate > 0.95 and a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P-value > 0.001 were included in the analyses. We used the Spearman correlation coefficient (Spearman’s rho) to detect associations between the coding allele of the SNP (directly genotyped or imputed allele dosages) and the variations in gene expression levels (residual gene expression levels obtained after corrections as described in “Gene expression quality control and normalization” in Supplementary Methods). To control for multiple testing, we applied more conservative probe-level false discovery rate (FDR) procedure. The eQTL mapping procedures are described in details in the S1 File.<SEP>Proportion of true positives<SEP>To estimate the sharing of cis-eQTLs between the two cell types and peripheral blood we used the π1 statistic (Storey and Tibshirani q-value approach implemented in the R qvalue package, default settings used). Based on the list of P-values, the overall proportion of true null hypotheses (π0) is estimated, i.e. those following the Uniform(0,1) distribution. An estimate of true alternative tests is π1 = 1 – π0, i.e. π1 is the proportion of true positives. The reported replication rate (proportion of sharing) between two groups (CD4+ or CD8+ T cells or pheripheral blood) is the π1 statistic estimated by taking the significant SNP-probe list from one group and using the corresponding P-value distribution in the other group.<SEP>Multi-tissue joint discovery of eQTLs<SEP>We used Bayesian framework for multi-tissue joint eQTL analysis by Flutre et al. in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells implemented in the eQtlBma program. The cis candidate region was defined as +/- 1 Mb from probe midpoint. As an input to the program, residual gene expression levels obtained after corrections as described above and the corresponding genotypes were used. Firstly, the raw Bayes factors for each configuration (eQTL active in CD4+, eQTL active in CD8+, eQTL active in both cell types) were computed assessing the support in the data for each probe-SNP pair being an eQTL. Secondly, information across all genes were combined by the hierarchical model with an EM algorithm to get maximum-likelihood estimates of the configuration probabilities. Thirdly, by Bayesian model averaging using the raw Bayes factors weighted by the estimated configuration probabilities, the posterior probabilities for the eQTL to be active in a given configuration were obtained. As a final result, only the best SNP per probe is picked, based on the posterior probability for a SNP to be “the” eQTL for a probe. To obtain the posterior probabilities, an estimate of the probability for a probe to have no eQTL in any cell type (π0) is needed. This was estimated using Storey and Tibshirani q-value approach via probe-level P-values obtained by 10,000 permutations.<SEP>Pathway analysis<SEP>The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool was used to establish associations with processes and diseases. The standard IPA enrichment analysis was performed with the set of all human genes on the Illumina array as background.<SEP>Bayesian test for colocalisation<SEP>The R package coloc was used to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. Assuming a single causal SNP for both of the traits in a region, posterior support for following hypothesis is estimated:<SEP>H0: neither trait has a genetic association in the region;<SEP>H1: only trait1 has a genetic association in the region;<SEP>H2: only trait2 has a genetic association in the region;<SEP>H3: both traits are associated, but with different causal variants;<SEP>H4: both traits are associated and share a single causal variant.<SEP>For trait1, we chose T1D susceptibility and obtained necessary summary statistics from Onengut-Gumuscu et al. from www.t1dbase.org (accessed 13/09/2016) webpage. For trait2, we chose the association with IRF1 and STAT1 expression in CD4+ T cells. Following Giambartolomei et al., we set prior probability (p1) that a variant is associated with trait1 to 10−4, prior probability (p2) for trans-eQTL effect to 10−5, and prior probability (p12) that a variant is associated with both traits to 10−6. To show the consistency of the results, we varied p2 and p12 values from 10−4 to 10−5 and 10−5 to 10−6, respectively.<SEP>Structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analysis<SEP>We compared the plausibility of potential models for the effects of the IL27 SNP on gene expression levels of STAT1 and IRF1 using structural equation modeling (SEM). First, to test the model’s concordance to the true population we used the chi-square test. Next, to assess the goodness of fit of the resulting models, we used the following measures: Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The CFI and TLI goodness of fit measures indicate good models for values higher than 0.9. RMSEA values less or equal to 0.05 indicate reasonable fit between the model and the data. To compare the models, we used the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Lower values of that theoretic measure indicate better models.<SEP>We applied the Sobel test to test whether a mediator carries the influence of the causal variable to the outcome, i.e. testing whether the indirect effect of the causal variable on the outcome via the mediator is significantly different from zero. The test statistic was calculated using the Sobel formula: , where a is the effect of the causal variable on the mediator and b is the effect of the mediator on the outcome and sa and sb are the corresponding standard errors of a and b.<SEP>IL27-IRF1-STAT1 simulation study<SEP>We conducted a simulation study to investigate the relationship between the coding allele of the SNP and expression levels of two genes, IRF1 and STAT1. Therefore, we performed 1000 simulations using a sample size of n = 1000. We generated SNP genotypes with the minor allele frequency being the sum of two random binary traits from a binomial distribution B(1, 0.37), IRF1 expression levels depending only on the SNP (irf1 = 0.903 − 1.237 × snp + N(0,1)) and STAT1 expression levels depending only on IRF1 expression levels (stat1 = 0.031 − 0.534 × irf1 + N(0,1)). Then using simulated data, we estimated the significance of the SNP allelic effect and IRF1 expression levels on STAT1 expression levels and the SNP allelic effect and STAT1 expression levels on IRF1 expression levels by linear models.<SEP>Graphics packages<SEP>Graphs were generated using R base packages and ggplot2. The LD plots were generated using LDheatmap, the regional association plots were generated with Locus Zoom using hg19/1000 Genomes Nov 2014 EUR for showing LD between the variants, and the circos plots were drawn using the Circos visualization tool.<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>We used linear mixed effects models to estimate the mean of the differences in methylation and expression levels between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells assessing random intercepts for each of the individuals adjusted for sex, age and batch effects (chip and position on chip). The effect of the mutant SNP on IRF1 and STAT1 transcript levels was also evaluated by linear mixed effects models.","Results<SEP>Genetic control of gene expression in T cells<SEP>We purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 313 healthy European individuals from the Estonian Biobank. The purified cells were subjected to genome-wide gene expression analysis, genotyping and imputation using the 1000 Genomes reference panel. After stringent quality control and filtering, close to 6 million SNPs, and expression data from 38,839 probes within 23,704 genes were included in the analysis. DNA methylation of 450,000 CpG sites was determined in the same purified cells of 100 of the individuals to add explanations to observed differential expression between cell types.<SEP>To characterize the extent of genetic control of gene expression in T cells and its cellular specificity, we first tested the association between SNPs and gene expression within 1Mb intervals, referred to as cis-eQTLs. In total, we identified cis regulatory SNPs for 2,605 genes in CD4+ T cells and 2,056 genes in CD8+ T cells at probe-level false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 (Fig 1A, S1 Table), with an overlap of 1,637 genes and estimated replication rate π1 = 0.99. The high replication rate reflects the similarity of the two cell types compared, and also highlights the limitations of arbitrary cut-off levels for significance. Moreover, about half of the significant eQTLs detected in a large meta-analysis of peripheral blood from 5000 individuals could be replicated in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (π1 = 0.51 and 0.45, respectively, S1 Fig), indicating a high level of T cell-specific eQTL effects. As examples of cis-eQTLs in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we observed evidence of genetic regulation of long coding RNA RP11−534L20.5 located 7 kb downstream of the IKBKE gene which has an essential role in regulating inflammatory responses to viral infections; STAT6, a transcriptional activator involved in T cell differentiation, and STX2 (syntaxin 2), involved in intracellular transport of vesicles (Fig 1B).<SEP>Cell type-specificity of eQTLs<SEP>We next used a Bayesian model averaging and hierarchical modelling that combines information across genes to jointly call eQTLs in one framework to assess the specificity and proportion of shared eQTLs in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Of 3871 genes associated with eQTLs, all showed very strong posterior probability to be shared between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (S2 Table).<SEP>One of the strengths of the multi-tissue joint cis-eQTL analysis is its capability to account for incomplete power. As our sample size for both of the cell types was similar, we noted the advantage of Bayesian methods in particular for genes with eQTLs that have modest effects. Moreover, for eQTLs where the absolute effect size was higher in one cell type, there was also a tendency for higher expression levels in that gene in the given cell type (chi-square test P-value < 2x10-16, S2 Fig). For a standard tissue-by-tissue analysis, higher effect sizes and small standard deviations lead to more statistical evidence against the null, thus resulting in lower P-values.<SEP>The effect of the magnitude of the expression levels is exemplified by the effect sizes and P-values of the probes in the inhibitory immune checkpoint gene, CTLA4, known to be associated with T1D and other endocrine autoimmune diseases. CTLA4 is covered by three probes all showing consistent eQTL effects shared by both cell types in the multi-tissue analysis (Fig 2A). In the tissue-by-tissue analysis, expression levels of CTLA4 were associated with 122 SNPs (S3A Fig), including T1D and RA-associated variants rs231775 (+49A/G), rs3087243 (CT60A/G), rs231806 (MH30C/G), and rs231735 (pair-wise r2 between the SNPs ranging from 0.51 to 0.90, and strong linkage disequilibrium (LD, r2 > 0.8) between MH30 and CT60, S3C Fig). The CT60 polymorphism is also in strong LD with length variation of the (AT)n repeat in the 3’UTR of CTLA4 with long variants of the repeat associating with lower CTLA4 mRNA expression in autoimmune T cell clones. Our results extend this finding to the polyclonal population of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, where the disease risk alleles were associated with lower expression levels of CTLA4 (S3B Fig). Genetic control of the expression of the alternatively spliced third exon, that is omitted from the secretory variant of CTLA4, was significantly detectable in CD4+ T cells only, whereas genetic association with the expression of the fourth exon was significant in both cell types (Fig 2B and 2E). Further investigation of the CTLA4 gene locus revealed differential methylation between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig 2C). Specifically, methylation of a CpG site near the second exon of CTLA4 (cg26091609) was inversely correlated with the expression levels of the three different probes in the gene (Fig 2D), possibly explaining the expression differences in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and thus failing to detect significant eQTL effects in the tissue-by-tissue analysis.<SEP>Interestingly, divergent DNA methylation between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was similarly detectable for an additional 73 out of 187 genes covered by more than one probe, and with seemingly isoform-specific eQTL effects (S3 Table). Among the 74 genes, multi-tissue analysis resulted in the identification of eQTL effects for two or more probes in 66 genes which were shared between the cell types. These observations suggest that the differential splicing effects, plausibly regulated by epigenetic DNA methylation, influence the gene expression levels, and thus the power to significantly detect eQTLs in the tissue-by-tissue analysis.<SEP>T cell specific trans-acting regulatory locus<SEP>For the analysis of SNPs affecting the expression of distal genes (>5 Mb apart), referred to as trans-eQTLs, we selected all 4,638 genome-wide significant (P-value < 5x10-8) SNPs from the GWAS catalog (accessed 24/03/2015). After correcting gene expression levels for cis-eQTL effects, we identified 36 and 40 GWAS SNPs associated with the expression levels of 209 and 378 distant genes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively (overlap of 21 SNPs and 133 genes; Fig 3A, S4 Table). The functions of the genes associated with the trans-acting GWAS SNPs highlighted their role in T1D (Ingenuity pathway analysis, P = 4.39x10-5, Fig 3A) and mTOR signaling (P = 3.84x10-3, Fig 3A) in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively.<SEP>Strikingly, we observed a trans-acting regulatory locus at chr12q13.2 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with broad-range impact on hundreds of genes. Five SNPs in that region were previously implicated in B cell-specific trans-associations by Fairfax et al.. In T cells, we identified the lead SNP in this region as rs1131017 located in the 5´UTR of the ribosomal small subunit protein RPS26 gene (S5 Table). The rs1131017 SNP is in LD with eight GWAS SNPs implicated in T1D, vitiligo and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The pair-wise r2 values of the nine SNPs are shown in S4B Fig and their eQTL effects in S4C Fig, illustrating the strong LD (r2 > 0.8) between the top trans-eQTL SNP rs1131017 and several of the GWAS SNPs. In addition to RPS26, the trans-acting region contains the CDK2, RAB5B, SUOX, IKZF4 and ERBB3 genes (S4A Fig) and associates with the expression levels of 187 and 351 genes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, with an overlap of 124 genes (Fig 3B). Many of these genes are highly expressed and have specific roles in T cells such as CTLA4, GZMA, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY and CD8A (Fig 3B).<SEP>Missense variant in IL27 as a candidate disease variant for T1D revealing significant trans-eQTL effects in CD4+ T cells<SEP>We also identified a trans-eQTL (GWAS SNP rs4788084[T]) on chr16p11.2 close to the IL27 gene associated with lower expression of IRF1 (P = 1.84x10-9) and STAT1 (P = 2.91x10-8) in CD4+ T cells only. The rs4788084[T] is associated with lower expression of STAT1 in peripheral blood and reduced risk for T1D. To further explore the effects of genetic variants in the IL27 region, we mapped trans-eQTLs for all SNPs in the chromosome 16:28,2–29,1 Mb region (829 SNPs in total, S6 Table, Fig 4A).<SEP>This analysis revealed an even stronger trans-eQTL signal for a missense SNP rs181206[G] within the IL27 gene (Fig 4B) and decreased expression levels of IRF1, STAT1 and REC8 (Fig 4C). The rs181206[G] allele, with a minor allele frequency of 29% in the 1000 Genomes phase 3 European population, causes the amino acid Leu119Pro change in the alpha-helical domain of IL-27 (S5 Fig). Strong LD (r2 ranges from 0.62 in the Estonian population to 0.84 in the other European populations, 1000 Genomes phase 3) between rs181206 and the GWAS SNP rs4788084 supports the protective role of the rs181206[G] allele for T1D among individuals of European ancestry. Of note, the effect of the missense SNP on IRF1 and STAT1 remains after regressing out the effect of the GWAS SNP, but not the other way around. Moreover, Bayesian test for colocalisation adds strength to the hypothesis that T1D susceptibility and changes of expression in IRF1 and STAT1 are associated with the region, and share a single causal variant with the most posterior support for rs181206[G] (S7 Table).<SEP>Importantly, despite the relatively small sample size, our focus on T cell subtypes enabled us to identify this effect as specific to CD4+ T cells, as we did not detect significant trans-eQTL effects in this region in CD8+ T cells (S6 Fig). We also confirmed the absence of the signal in B cells and monocytes by re-analyzing the data from Fairfax et al. (S6 Fig). Notably, the trans-eQTL locus had no effects on the expression level of IL27 in cis (S7 Fig). In agreement with the cell type-specific effect, we found higher expression levels of the IL27RA and IL6ST (gp130) genes, which together act as a receptor for the IL-27 cytokine, in CD4+ cells in comparison to CD8+ T cells (Fig 4D).<SEP>Given the strong positive correlation between the expression levels of IRF1 and STAT1, we used structural equation modeling to determine whether the IL27 SNP rs181206 affects both genes independently or via each other. Overall, the best-fitting scenario suggested IRF1 to mediate the SNP and STAT1 relationship (model 1, S8 Table). The finding was supported by a simulation experiment (S8 Fig) and suggested a mechanism for the effect of IL-27 on IRF1 and STAT1 expression (S9 Fig).<SEP>Functional effects of the IL27 missense SNP suggest causal role in decreased expression of IRF1 and STAT1<SEP>In order to confirm the functional effect of the IL27 rs181206[G] allele we investigated its effect on IRF1 and STAT1 expression in human PBMCs by additional experiments. IL-27 is produced by innate immune cells, and after forming a heterodimer with EBI3, it interacts with its receptor IL27RA and activates the STAT1/STAT3 pathway in T cells. After binding to interferon stimulated response elements (ISRE), the STAT1/STAT3 pathway induces transcription of several interferon-induced genes, including IRF1 and STAT1 itself. We cloned cDNA variants of the IL-27 wild-type (Leu119) and missense (Pro119), as well as EBI3. After transfection into HEK293 cells, we combined the cell supernatants containing either IL-27 Leu119 or Pro119 protein with an equal amount of EBI3 protein and studied their effect on IRF1 and STAT1 expression by real-time PCR in human PBMCs from four healthy individuals.<SEP>As shown in Fig 4E, the missense SNP resulting in Pro119 in IL-27 induced lower STAT1 and IRF1 transcript levels compared to IL-27 Leu119. The comparison of the fixed effects of the rs181206[G] allele resulted in highly significant estimates:  = -1.11 (P = 5.52x10-13) for IRF1 and  = -1.28 (P = 4.86x10-10) for STAT1. This result supports our trans-eQTL analysis, suggesting that the Pro119 in the IL27 gene is the causal SNP of these associations.","Discussion<SEP>We here report eQTL mapping in purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and reveal multiple effects on regulation of genes associated with autoimmune diseases. The eQTL studies in cell subtypes have both demonstrated a high level of specificity as their effects vary across cell types, as well as remarkable sensitivity despite their several fold smaller sample sizes. Indeed, we also observed many cis-eQTLs identified in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were shared according to the joint analysis, but were seemingly cell type-specific by the tissue-by-tissue analysis. The genes with such notable patterns include CTLA4, known for its inhibitory role in T cell mediated immune responses and association with many organ-specific autoimmune diseases. The autoimmunity-susceptible SNPs in this region (rs231775, rs3087243, and rs231806) have been associated with various functional effects including CTLA4 transcript levels, splicing, production of the soluble form of CTLA-4 and posttranslational modifications. In addition, our results show differential DNA methylation in the CTLA4 region to be associated with the potential isoform-specific differences in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This is likely due to negative correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression, which eventually leads to lower expression levels and moderate effect sizes. To confirm whether the observed effects are due to true differences in isoforms instead of the quality of the designed probes at capturing variation in gene expression levels, a follow-up study with RNA-seq data is needed.<SEP>The observed trans-acting regulatory region on chr12q13.2 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells indicates the important role of genetic variants in that region affecting the expression levels of over a hundred genes across the genome. Interestingly, the region includes the RPS26 gene, which may constitute a mechanism for the detected trans-eQTL effects. Our lead SNP rs1131017 is located in an oligopyrimidine tract of the 5´UTR of the RPS26 mRNA and its T1D risk allele rs1131017[C] correlates positively with RPS26 expression levels. The oligopyrimidine tract controls the translation of many mammalian ribosomal protein genes, and the effect of the SNP on RPS26 ribosomal distribution has been reported. RPS26 is a main component of the ribosomal region involved in the recruitment of cellular mRNA during translational initiation and in maintenance of the path of mRNA molecules to the ribosomal exit site. Hence, it is conceivable that changed RPS26 protein levels may affect the stability or translational efficiency of a large number of cytosolic mRNAs. Nevertheless, the exact functional role of rs1131017[C] in T1D remains to be identified, as well as the effect of other candidate genes in this region such as IKZF4, ERBB3 and CDK2.<SEP>Strikingly, we identified a common missense variant in cytokine IL27 as a significant trans-eQTL for IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. The effect of IL-27 in T cells is regarded as anti-inflammatory but it has also been shown as a growth and survival factor for T cells. As a heterodimer with EBI3, IL-27 activates the STAT1/STAT3 pathway that induces the transcription of several interferon-induced genes, including IRF1 and STAT1 itself. Our model suggests that IRF1 mediates the effect of the IL27 SNP on expression levels of STAT1. Moreover, our functional studies with the mutated form of IL-27 confirmed its decreased capacity to activate the STAT1 pathway, and we showed that a potential causal variant (the missense variant rs181206) for T1D susceptibility and changes in IRF1 and STAT1 expression is shared. Furthermore, our findings are supported by studies of a T1D mouse model with high levels of IL-27 and delayed T1D onset after treatment with an IL-27 blocking antibody. Altogether these results suggest that the rs181206[G] variant of the IL27 gene confers protection against T1D through the inhibited expression of IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. Our results also suggest that IL-27 may promote autoimmunity toward pancreatic islets via the upregulation of the STAT1 pathway.<SEP>In conclusion, the analysis of genetic modulators of gene expression profiles as intermediate phenotypes between human traits and underlying genetic variation offers new instruments to refine our understanding of disease susceptibility. Moreover, eQTL studies in purified cell types instead of whole blood enable us to establish the specific mechanisms and pathways involved in diseases progression and create the basis for future explorations and drug interventions.",29688,['FOODAL']
28993876,"Introduction<SEP>Asthma is a complex respiratory disease. It is one of the most common lung disorders, characterized by a chronic airway inflammation. The airway epithelial cells can produce cytokines and chemokines to initiate immune responses. Asthma is a T-helper type 2 (Th2)-dependent disease associated to a higher production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13, which induces the release of IL-8 from human bronchial epithelial cells.<SEP>The IL-8 belongs to the superfamily of CXC chemokines, exerts its effect through two receptors, IL-8 receptor alpha (IL-8 RA, CXCR1) and beta (IL-8 RB, CXCR2). IL-8 is a strong chemotactic cytokine that activates the inflammatory cells by the recruitment of neutrophils, mononuclear phagocytes, mast cells, and T cells. IL-8 is involved in the initiation of the acute and chronic inflammatory process. It is implicated in the pathogenesis of several pulmonary diseases like bronchial asthma, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), severe infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and viral bronchiolitis. Various reports have also described the capacity of Th2, Th-9, and Th-17 cells to induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines as the IL-8, which contribute to the expansion of neutrophils to the airway epithelial cells of patients with asthma. An increased level of IL-8 was observed in Broncho-alveolar fluid (BALF), sputum, and endobronchial biopsies of patients with asthma. Furthermore, a higher IL-8 serum levels were observed for severe patients with asthma that suggested that IL-8 plays an important role in asthma severity. Therefore, IL-8 might protect against the development of atopic asthma by the inhibition of IgE production.<SEP>Human IL-8 is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 4q13–q21 and composed of four exons, three introns, and a proximal promoter region. Fifteen IL8 polymorphisms were characterized to date and only two were reported to be associated with altered IL-8 mRNA levels. The IL-8-251A/T (rs4073) polymorphism located on the promoter region, was reported to be associated with an increased IL-8 level. The IL-8 + 781C/T (rs2227306) located within the first intron, was described to promote gene transcription and regulation. Recently, genetic association studies showed that these polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility to inflammatory diseases as RSV bronchiolitis, ARDS, lung cancer, and asthma.<SEP>Our data suggest that IL8 is important in the genetic control of human asthma susceptibility. A recent advance in sequence-specific gene silencing provides a new platform to develop gene-specific drugs for disease management. Then, molecular study of IL8 gene might contribute to elucidate in part the mechanism of asthma development and facilitate in the future the development of new drugs.<SEP>The aim of this study was to analyze the association of rs4073 and rs2227306 polymorphisms with the risk of childhood asthma development. We also investigated the correlation of IL-8 protein and mRNA levels with childhood asthma development and disease severity in the Tunisian population.","Methods<SEP>Study Population<SEP>A total of 170 asthmatic children were recruited between May 2013 and September 2015, from the department of Pediatric and Respiratory Diseases, Abderrahmane MAMI Hospital of Chest Diseases, Ariana, Tunisia. Asthma diagnosis was established according to GINA recommendations, based on clinical asthma symptoms and lung function test. The classification of asthma severity was determined on the basis of clinical symptoms and lung function according to GINA guidelines. Only patients whose asthma was controlled were retained.<SEP>Our population includes 117 patients diagnosed with atopic asthma and 53 without. All patients were classified according to asthma severity into four groups: a mild intermittent (n = 2), a mild persistent (n = 87), a moderate persistent (n = 70), and a severe persistent asthma (n = 11).<SEP>In addition, we recruited a group of 170 age-matched healthy control children from the emergency department of Tunis children hospital for only pathologies related to accidents of daily life such as fractures and without respiratory or allergy manifestations. All controls were free of any infectious symptoms. The inclusion criteria for the control group were as follows: no symptoms or history of asthma, of other pulmonary diseases, of allergy, and of any chronic disease. Written informed consent was obtained from parents of participating children. All data and sample collections for this study were approved by the local ethics committee (Table 1). <SEP>All information on tobacco exposure (passive smoking or second-hand smoke, or environmental tobacco smoke) used in this analysis was collected at baseline only for patients. We did not obtain total information from healthy subject parents (the data were missing in more than 20% of patients for tobacco smoking habits in the control group).<SEP>The classification of passive and no smoker was based on the information on the active smoking habits status for parent who was never, current, or former smokers. Questions on exposure to passive smoking related to each of the following: “the age at which they started smoking, the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the duration of smoking in years at home and at work.” Among former smokers, age at quitting smoking was also collected.<SEP>Estimation of Human IL-8 Serum Levels<SEP>For the serum preparation, we collect 5 ml of venous blood in a plain tube without anticoagulant and then allowed to clot for about 4 h at room temperature. The serum was separated by centrifugation (1300×g, for 15 min), then was taken and stored at − 80 °C until use. The determination of the IL-8 serum levels was performed in duplicate using a commercially available IL-8 Human ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, US) with the use of an ELx 800 Automated Microplate Reader, Bio-Tek Instruments (Winooski, VT). The IL-8 serum level data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SD). A P value < 0.05 was accepted as significant.<SEP>Determination of Human IL-8 mRNA Levels<SEP>The determination of IL-8 mRNA levels of expression was performed by the real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) as we previously reported. The mRNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using TRIZOL® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) samples were synthesized using random hexamer primers and RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Fermentas). The qRT-PCR was done in a 25 μl reaction using an Applied Biosystems system (AB, Foster City, CA). The reaction systems include 15 μg/μl (2.5 μl) of cDNA template, 10 μM of each forward and reverse primers set and the appropriate dilution of SYBR Green mix (QIAGEN, Germany), and the adequate volume of distilled water (Gibco).<SEP>The β-actin mRNA (internal control) was quantified in the same way as the IL-8 mRNA, using the forward and reverse primers 5′-ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGT-3′ and 5′-CCTCTTCAAAAACTTCTCCACACC-3′, respectively, and using the probes: 5′-CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC-3′ and 5′-GCTCGTC GTCGACAACGGCTC-3′.<SEP>The qRT-PCR detection system was used for amplification and the employed cycling program was as follows: Initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min; then 40 cycles of a second denaturation step at 94 °C for 15 s; an annealing step at 59 °C for 45 s, and an extension step at 72 °C for 45 s; after that, a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min.<SEP>IL-8 Polymorphisms Genotyping<SEP>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the Salting-out procedure as described. The study of rs4073 and rs2227306 polymorphisms was assessed for 170 patients and 170 controls. The IL-8 SNPs were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP)-based method.<SEP>The following primers [Forward: CCATCATGATAGCATCTGT; Reverse: CCACAATTTGGT GAATTATTAA] were used to amplify the 173-bp DNA fragment of the rs4073 polymorphism. The primers [Forward: CTCTAACTCTTTATATAGGAATT; Reverse: GATTGATTTTATCAACAGGCA] were used to amplify the 203-bp DNA fragment of the rs2227306 polymorphism. The PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 100 ng genomic DNA, 0.5 μmol/l of each primer, 200 μmol/l of each dNTP, 10× PCR buffer, 2 mmol/l MgCl2, and 2,5 U of DNA Taq polymerase.<SEP>The PCR amplification conditions for the rs4073 polymorphism included an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles with a second denaturation step at 94 °C for 30 s, an annealing step at 60 °C for 55 s, and an extension step at 72 °C for 60 s, then a final extension step at 72 °C for 8 min. The PCR products were digested with 1 U of the restriction enzyme AseI (Fermentas). The rs4073 A allele was identified by 21- and 152-bp fragments and the T allele by a single 173-bp fragment.<SEP>However, the procedure of PCR amplification for the rs2227306 region was as follows: pre-denaturation at 94 °C for 8 min, 35 cycles of denaturing step at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing step at 54 °C for 30 s, extension step at 72 °C for 30 s, and then a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were digested by 1 U of the restriction enzyme EcoRI (MBI Fermentas). The rs2227306 C allele was identified by 19- and 184-bp fragments and the T allele by a single 203-bp fragment. The digested fragments were visualized on an ultraviolet illuminator after separation on a 3% agarose gel stained with 0.1% ethidium bromide.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>The genotype frequencies were tested for the deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).<SEP>The association analysis was performed using the open Epi Info Version 6 and 7 software based on a standard Chi-squared test. The P values smaller than 0.05 were considered significant. The strength of a genetic association is indicated by the odds ratio (OR). The OR and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated whenever applicable.<SEP>The quantitative statistical analysis was performed by Prism V.5 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). The IL-8 expression levels were analyzed by the t test that used to compare the mean values between two groups. The reported P values are two tailed and P values < 0.05 were considered significant.<SEP>Haploview program version 4.2 was used to calculate the pairwise Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between the IL8 SNPs. The Haplotype frequencies and effects were performed using Haploview. The P values for the patient–control differences in diplotype distributions were adjusted for multiple tests by Bonferroni correction. Only the allele frequencies of the diplotype > 1% were included in the analyses, those < 1% were excluded.","Results<SEP>IL-8 Serum and mRNA Expression Levels<SEP>In the current study, we compared the level of IL-8 protein in the serum and mRNA of 170 cases and 170 controls (Fig. 1). The IL-8 serum levels were significantly higher in patient (48.82 ± 27.36 pg/ml) than in control (10.67 ± 4.62 pg/ml; P < 0.0001) group (Fig. 1a). <SEP>No significant difference in PBMC composition between patients with asthma and healthy controls was claimed.<SEP>We found that the IL-8 serum concentrations were markedly elevated in children with moderate and severe asthma (n = 81; 71.55 ± 21.09 pg/ml) than those with mild form (n = 89; 28.55 ± 21.14 pg/ml, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2a). <SEP>We also reported in Fig. 1b, a significantly higher IL-8 mRNA levels in patients than in controls (P = 0.004). IL-8 mRNA levels were further increased in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma compared to mild asthma group (P = 0.025) (Fig. 2b).<SEP>However, the IL-8 mRNA expression and the distribution of protein levels, according to different IL-8 genotypes for both polymorphisms did not differ significantly in the asthmatic group (Supplementary Fig. 1).<SEP>Genotype Analysis of IL-8 Gene<SEP>The distribution of rs4073 and rs2227306 genotype frequencies for healthy controls and patients with asthma was in agreement with HWE (data not shown).<SEP>We observed a significant difference in the genotype and allele distributions of rs4073 and rs2227306 polymorphisms between asthmatic and healthy children (Table 2). <SEP>For the rs4073, the homozygous TT genotype was more frequent in asthmatic than in control groups (P = 0.002). The presence of this genotype was significantly associated with an increased asthma risk (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.28–2.48). Then, the presence of the rs4073 T allele is considered as a risk factor for asthma development.<SEP>The allele and genotype frequencies of rs2227306 were also significantly different between case and control groups, which suggest that the rs2227306 was associated with asthma susceptibility. Our results indicated that the subjects carrying CC or CT genotypes were more exposed to develop asthma compared to those carrying the TT genotype (OR > 2; P = 0.036).<SEP>We also analyzed the association of these polymorphisms with atopy. The frequency of the rs4073 TT and rs2227306 CC genotypes differed significantly between children with atopic asthma and healthy controls (P = 0.005 and P = 0.02, respectively). The presence of the rs4073 TT (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.25–2.65) or the rs2227306 CC (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14–2.47) genotypes was associated with an increased risk to develop atopic asthma (Table 3). <SEP>Subject with at least one copy of rs4073 T allele had more risk to be diagnosed with asthma disease at an advanced stage (P = 0.02; OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.12–13.29) (Supplementary Table 1). Then, the rs4073 T allele is considered as a risk factor for asthma severity in Tunisian children.<SEP>Haplotype Frequencies of IL-8 Gene<SEP>LD test between IL-8 polymorphisms was estimated by the value of D’ (0.151). The most frequent diplotype in our population was TC (42.6%), but no significant difference was shown between patients and controls (P > 0.05). Therefore, the frequency of the rare diplotype AT was significantly associated with low asthma childhood risk in our population (P C < 0.0004) (Supplementary Table 2).","Discussion<SEP>Our results indicated an elevated IL-8 serum and mRNA levels in the Tunisian asthmatic children and particularly for the subjects with moderate/severe asthma. The excessive release of IL-8 in asthmatic group, observed in our study was consistent with many previous findings. In the same way, different studies revealed a positive association between the increased neutrophil count and asthma severity. Then, the reason of the increase in IL-8 levels may be due to the association of the IL-8 to neutrophil recruitment in the lung injury. In fact, human bronchial epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and airway smooth muscle cells recruit neutrophils into the airways by the release of IL-8 and/or other chemokines. IL-8 might participate extensively in the development of airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in asthma and might be used as a biomarker for disease evolution and severity.<SEP>In the present case–control study, we also analyzed the association of two IL8 variants with the childhood asthma susceptibility. Our findings suggested that the rs4073 and rs2227306 were strongly associated with an increased childhood asthma risk. These results indicated that the expression of IL-8 genetic polymorphisms could contribute to the pathogenesis of childhood asthma.<SEP>Our results represent a replication of previous Heinzmann et al. findings, in the German asthmatic children. The presence of rs4073 was also associated with the risk to develop RSV bronchiolitis, acute pancreatitis, atrophic gastritis, and Behcet’s disease. In contrast, many other studies did not find any significant association with the polymorphism rs4073 and the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or lung cancer development. Discrepancies in ethnicities, sample size, and genetic background may have caused the difference in the results of different studies.<SEP>Our data indicated a significant association between the rs4073 T allele and the childhood asthma atopy and severity. In fact, previous study indicated that the presence of the rs4073 T was associated with an increased IL-8 levels in the bronchioles contributing to a higher local pulmonary inflammation and then to asthma severity.<SEP>Genetic polymorphisms may have important functional consequences. These variations are able to influence the expression or the activity of the resulting protein. It has been reported that the two polymorphisms rs4073 and rs2227306 influenced the transcriptional activity of the IL8. Firstly, the expression levels of IL-8 (mRNA and protein) might be influenced by other factors than the only presence of IL-8 variants and the expression of these SNPs might have other effects like the alteration of the expression of a more distant gene in particular SNP situated in the promoter region. Secondly, when SNPs were not studied within the exact haplotype blocks (some SNPs in the same region are in LD with others SNPs), we cannot conclude about the real effect of IL-8 SNPs on the expression of IL-8.<SEP>The rs4073 is the most important polymorphism and it is located in the transcription start site. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that this polymorphism increases the production of IL-8. Lee et al. have described that the rs4073 T allele possessed a transcriptional activity twofold to fivefold stronger than the rs4073 A allele, which contributed to the high IL–8 amount as described. Additionally, it has been shown that the IL8 promoter DNA sequence around the position–251 was conformed to the binding motif of C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein). Then, this functional effect might be related to the fact that the nuclear factors such as C/EBP and GATA bind with high affinity to the IL-8 transcription regulatory sites in the presence of the T allele. However, experimental results suggest that the differences in IL-8 expression are not linked directly to the rs4073 polymorphism. Therefore, other SNPs could be implicated in the transcriptional and translational activities.<SEP>For the rs2227306, our findings were consistent to report results in asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. In fact, it has been reported that the rs2227306 located in IL8 intron 1, promotes the regulation of gene transcription by a CAAT (cytosine–cytosine–adenosine–adenosine–thymidine) box that locates downstream of rs2227306. Hacking et al. observed that C/EBP β preferentially bound in the presence of the rs2227306 T allele in respiratory epithelial cells. C/EBP β has an important role in the regulation of inflammation, and its binding to the regulatory region in the IL8 gene increases significantly the transcription.<SEP>In our study, the frequency of the less frequent haplotype AT was significantly associated with low asthma childhood risk in our population (P < 0.0004). In contrast, this haplotype is the more transmitted in patients with bronchiolite, then it represented a significant association with susceptibility to bronchiolitis.<SEP>In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first study in the association of rs4073 and rs2227306 polymorphisms with childhood asthma risk in the Tunisian population. Our data confirmed the inflammatory role of IL-8, which could be used as a marker for asthma childhood severity. Further investigation on the IL8 gene variants and their biological functions is also needed.",19569,['FOODAL']
21818772,"1 Introduction<SEP>There has been increasing interest in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with disease phenotypes. The ultimate goal of most of these association studies is to help uncover the biological mechanisms involved in the disease, which can subsequently lead to better understanding of the disease process and improved strategies for disease prevention and management. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become popular tools for discovering loci in the human genome that can give rise to disease susceptibility. A GWAS is a hypothesis free method wherein a large number of markers are genotyped in many samples to find genetic variations associated with a disease phenotype.<SEP>Most GWAS employ a case-control design and are concerned with identifying SNPs that affect disease susceptibility. On cancer phenotypes alone, more than 50 studies have been published to date. However, recently there has been increased interest in identifying genetic markers that characterize a patient's prognosis. Prognostic markers are important for identifying patients with more aggressive disease who may need more aggressive or prioritized treatment to improve survival outcomes. In addition to potentially using these markers to tailor individual treatments, knowledge of these markers can help gain understanding into the biological processes that underlie disease progression. To identify prognostic markers, an investigator will typically employ prospective cohort design and collect information on baseline predictors and the time from baseline to the occurrence of a clinical outcome of interest. Examples of clinical event times include time to death or time to secondary tumor from diagnosis. GWAS of survival outcomes have become available for various diseases. For instance, conducted a GWAS of survival after diagnosis of breast cancer. performed a GWAS on time to first tooth eruption.<SEP>A typical GWAS design includes (at least) two stages. The first is the discovery stage which usually involves genotyping samples at a large number of SNPs using readily available commercial chips. Instead of genotyping each individual at every SNP in the genome, by utilizing the linkage disequilibrium (LD) and data from the completed HapMap project, only a smaller subset of SNPs (called typed SNPs) are genotyped. A selected number of top-ranked loci are then followed-up in independent replication samples at the subsequent replication stages. The region around the replicated typed SNP is then fine-mapped to examine the true disease locus. In the discovery stage, a single locus approach is most commonly used for statistical analysis. The typical analysis in this stage involves fitting a logistic regression model (for case-control study) or Cox proportional hazards model (for time-to-event outcome) to each SNP, often adjusting for non-genetic covariates.<SEP>Such a single SNP approach has several limitations. It may suffer from low power due to a large number of tests and small effect sizes of individual SNPs, likely resulting in a large number of false positives. Specifically, the true causal SNP is often not genotyped but is captured through LD with the typed SNPs. Since each typed SNP is likely to be in partial LD with the true causal SNP, the observed effect size might be smaller. Furthermore, multiple SNPs jointly affecting the disease phenotype via a complex structure (e.g. epistasis) will not be captured by the single SNP approach.<SEP>Few multi-locus tests for censored survival observations exist. The existing methods can be broadly classified into two categories: (i) individual-SNP based minimum p-value analysis (min test); (ii) haplotype-based tests. For multi-marker tests based on min p-value analysis, in order to test for the effect of a group of loci, one calculates the p-values for individual SNPs and corrects the minimum of these individual p-values to account for multiple comparison by estimating the effective number of SNPs or via Monte Carlo methods. As these tests rely heavily on the individual SNP approach, they do not fully utilize the correlation between the SNPs and focus only on combining p-values from the various tests. The second class of methods is haplotype-based analysis. Studies have shown that haplotype-based analysis have little advantage over single SNP analysis.<SEP>To overcome the difficulties in a single SNP approach, in this paper we apply a kernel machine regression based approach to jointly analyze multiple SNPs for association with censored survival outcomes. We first group SNPs into SNP-sets based on biological criteria such as genes or LD blocks, and then test for the overall joint effects of all SNPs in a SNP-set. Specifically, we use a kernel machine Cox regression framework and apply a score test to assess the joint effect of a SNP-set on the survival outcome. This approach utilizes genetic information from all SNPs in a SNP-set simultaneously, leading to a more powerful test with reduced degrees of freedom when the typed SNPs are in LD with each other. By employing non-linear kernels, this test can also capture the potentially non-linear and/or interaction effects of the SNPs.<SEP>The kernel-machine (KM) approach has been developed and applied for continuous and binary phenotypes to test for the pathway effects of gene expressions. applied linear KM to candidate gene studies with quantitative traits. applied logistic KM to case-control GWAS to test for the SNP-set effect. However, these methods are not applicable to survival data, which are subject to censoring and use the Cox proportional hazards model. proposed a kernel Cox regression model for modeling the effect of gene expression on survival, where they focused on estimating regression coefficients and prediction, and did not provide any inference procedures for the regression coefficient estimates of the gene expression level effects. extended their work by developing a KM based score test for assessing the pathway effect based on gene expression data on censored survival outcomes, where they considered the linear kernel for linear effects and the Gaussian kernel for interactions of gene expressions in a pathway.<SEP>Our work is an extension of in which we tailor their methodology for application to genotype data from a GWAS survival study. Specifically, we take into account the particular characteristics of SNPs in a GWAS study. For example, we consider scenarios where the true causal SNP may be untyped, as well as use kernels that are appropriate only for SNP data, e.g. the identity-by-state (IBS) kernel, for modeling SNP-SNP interactions. Note that the Gaussian kernel is suitable for continuous gene expression data but is not suitable for discrete SNP data. We perform an extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed survival KM methods for testing for the SNP-set effect in GWAS. Our paper can also be viewed as an extension of the logistic KM method of where we apply the KM method to a prospective cohort GWAS in which the phenotype is a censored survival outcome modeled using the Cox proportional hazards model and the test is based on martingale residuals to incorporate censoring.<SEP>This paper makes three key contributions. First, we describe a powerful alternative using SNP-sets to the single SNP Cox model in analyzing whole genome data. Second, we illustrate the feasibility of employing a kernel machine framework in analyzing time-to-event outcome in GWAS, that takes into account biological information as well as allows for testing for multiple causal SNPs and epistasis. Finally, we demonstrate via numerical simulations that our approach has better performance than the standard single SNP based minimum p-value test (min test) when the typed SNPs are in LD with each other and with the true causal SNP. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we will first discuss how SNP-sets can be formed and then introduce the survival kernel machine method, before presenting simulation results. Lastly, we apply our method to a GWAS dataset to identify genes associated with lung cancer survival.<SEP>2 Forming SNP-sets<SEP>The motivation behind forming SNP-sets is two-fold. Firstly, it allows us to capture the joint effects of multiple SNPs and harness the LD between the SNPs in the SNP-set to increase test power. Secondly, it allows us to incorporate biological information on how SNPs may collectively affect the phenotype of interest, so the results have better biological interpretation. There are various ways to form SNP-sets, see for an overview. For example, one could form SNP-sets by including all the SNPs that are located near a gene. This could be done by taking all SNPs from the transcription start to end, and possibly include all SNPs that are upstream and downstream of a gene. A gene-based approach is useful in helping to identify genes that are associated with the disease. Since the true causal SNP is often not genotyped and is probably correlated with several SNPs in the SNP-set, by forming gene SNP-sets and using the kernel machine method, we can increase power by using the correlation between the SNPs in the SNP-set. Another way to form a SNP-set is by pathway, e.g. by including all SNPs that fall within a gene and including all genes in a biological pathway. The advantage of this approach is that if there are multiple causal SNPs falling within different regions associated with the disease, the kernel machine method would be able to capture this, leading to increased power. The drawback of forming SNP-sets using genes or biological pathways is that not all genes are known and some SNPs associated with a disease can be located in gene deserts. An alternative is to form SNP-sets based on LD blocks, recombination hot-spots, or using a sliding window approach. These methods allow complete coverage of the genome. For illustration purposes, we will form SNP-sets using the gene-based approach in this article.","3 Survival Kernel Machine Method<SEP>Consider a S × 1 covariate vector Zi containing the genotypes for the S SNPs in the SNP-set, and a R × 1 covariate vector Xi containing the R non-genetic covariates for individual i. For an additive effect of the allele, the genotype of each SNP is coded as 0, 1 or 2. Let Ti denote the survival time for individual i. Due to censoring, Ti is observable up to a bivariate vector (Ui, Δi), where Ui = min(Ti, Ci), Δi = I(Ti ≤ Ci), and Ci is the censoring time for the ith subject. We require the standard assumption that Ci is independent of Ti conditional on Zi and Xi. For a study with sample size n, the data consist of n independent and identically distributed copies of random vectors {(Ui, Δi, Zi, Xi), i = 1, ⋯, n}. Assume that survival time Ti is related to Zi and Xi through the Cox proportional hazards model:  For example, specifying  corresponds to the usual Cox proportional hazards model including only main effect terms for all the S SNPs in the SNP-set (while adjusting for the R non-genetic covariates). To allow for flexibility in modeling the effects of the SNPs in a SNP-set, we allow h(·) to be an arbitrary function generated by a given positive definite kernel function K(·, ·). To allow for the potential non-linear effects from the covariates, X may include non-linear bases of the original covariates such as polynomial or splines.<SEP>3.1 Kernels<SEP>A kernel function K(·, ·) implicitly specifies a functional space ℋK spanned by a particular set of orthogonal basis functions , where J is allowed to be infinite. By the representation theorem, a properly regularized estimator of h(Z) based on the observed data can be written as both  and  where αi are the unknown parameters. The kernel function is a projection of the genotype data from the original space to a new space (spanned by the basis functions , in which h(·) is modeled linearly in this new space, as illustrated by equation (2). Intuitively, K(Zj, Zl) is a distance metric measuring the similarity between two individuals, the jth and lth subject, with respect to their genotype information in the SNP-set. A few popular choices of kernels K(·, ·) that can be used for SNP data are given below. The linear kernel given by:  implicitly specifies ℋK to be spanned by , which corresponds to the standard Cox model with main effects for all SNPs in the SNP-set, i.e. . The weighted linear kernel is similar to the linear kernel, except that weights can be incorporated to improve power.  <SEP>For example, if we define the weights to be , where qs is the minor allele frequency (MAF) for the sth SNP in the SNP-set, this will cause rare variants to be given higher weights, while down weighting the common variants. Such a weight might be used to prevent information from SNPs with low MAF to be smoothed over by SNPs with high MAF.<SEP>The advantage of using the kernel machine method is that the basis functions  are not always easily specified. With a variety of kernels to choose from, one can conveniently specify more complex models especially for high-dimensional data. Two such kernels are the identical by state (IBS) kernel and the weighted IBS kernel, which are defined using the number of alleles shared IBS by subjects j and l at the S typed SNPs. The IBS kernel is:  where IBS(Zj,s, Zl,s) is the number of alleles shared IBS (0, 1, or 2) by subjects j and l at SNP s in the SNP-set. The advantage of using the IBS kernel is that it allows for SNP-SNP interactions (epistasis). The weighted IBS kernel is similar to the IBS kernel, except that like the weighted linear kernel, it allows weights to be incorporated. Other choices of kernels could also be employed as long as the kernel function satisfies the requirements of Mercer's Theorem, which includes the condition that the kernel function is positive definite (eigenvalues must be positive). See for examples of additional kernels. The choice of a kernel specifies a metric with which the genetic distance between the two individuals are measured and will influence the power of the test.<SEP>3.2 Kernel Machine Score test for Censored Survival Outcomes<SEP>We are interested in testing the null hypothesis that a SNP-set, for example a gene, is not associated with the event time of interest after adjusting for covariates X. This corresponds to testing H0 : h(Z) = 0 under model (1). From equation (3), testing H0 is equivalent to testing . Assuming that α = (α1, …, αn)T follows an arbitrary distribution with mean zero and variance covariance matrix τ𝕂−, H0 is equivalent to testing H0 : τ = 0, where 𝕂 is the n × n matrix whose (i, j)th element is K(Zi, Zj) and 𝕂− is the generalized inverse of 𝕂. Under such a random effect framework, H0 can tested using a score statistic for the variance component, namely  where M̂ = (M̂1, ⋯, M̂n)⊤,  is the estimated martingale residual for individual i under H0, Yi(t) = I(Ui ≥ t), γ̂ is the partial likelihood estimator of γ and  is the Breslow’s estimator of  under the null model of , and  <SEP>As discussed in, the test statistic Q under the null follows a mixture of chi-square distributions which can be approximated via resampling methods. To obtain a p-value for the test using resampling methods, derived asymptotic expansions of the score statistic as double integrated martingale processes, and then generated realizations of the score statistic under the null by approximating the distribution of the martingale processes via resampling. Intuitively, the score statistic determines the extent to which genetic similarities as described by the kernel is correlated to similarities in phenotype. This can be seen if we rewrite the first term in the score statistic  The term K(Zi, Zj) would be large if the ith and jth patients have similar genetic profiles, while the term M̂iM̂j would be large if they also have similar disease prognosis. Thus the term M̂iM̂jK(Zi, Zj) would be large if genotype similarities are correlated with phenotype similarities for the ith and jth patients. The second term of the score statistic is a centering term so that the score statistic Q has mean zero. Hence the score statistic describes whether patients with similar genetic profiles have similar disease prognosis.<SEP>4 Simulations<SEP>We conducted simulation studies to investigate the performance of the survival kernel machine based SNP-set test in a genome-wide association study, whereby SNP-sets are formed by including all SNPs located near a gene. For simplicity, no additional covariates were included. We generated SNP-sets based on the LD structure of a single gene using the program HAPGEN. The LD structure was derived from the CEU population in the HapMap project (build 35, release 21). For illustration purposes, we considered four different genes of varying sizes as summarized in Table i. The gene locations were obtained from the gene list used by PLINK.<SEP>For each gene, we simulated genotype data for all HapMap SNPs from the transcription start to the transcription end of the gene. A SNP is considered as a typed SNP if it is on the Illumina HumanHap550 array. These are the observed SNPs that make up the SNP-sets. In our simulations, we restricted testing to common variants, i.e. typed SNPs with MAF ≥ 0.05. We compared the kernel machine method to the single SNP based minimum p-value test (min test), which is calculated by fitting the standard Cox model to each SNP in the SNP-set individually and correcting the smallest p-value pmin for multiple testing by the effective number of SNPs Neff in the SNP-set, where Neff is estimated using the method developed by:  For the kernel machine method, we considered three different kernels: (i) linear kernel, (ii) IBS kernel, and (iii) inverse root MAF weighted IBS kernel ( where qs =MAF). To obtain a p-value for a SNP-set, perturbations were used (see for details).<SEP>4.1 Size Simulations<SEP>To investigate the empirical size of the survival kernel machine SNP-set test, we conducted simulations in which survival times were simulated from the exponential distribution with constant hazard λ0(t) = 1. This corresponds to the null model:  Censoring times were generated from the exponential distribution with mean μC = 1 to yield about 25% censoring. For each dataset, only typed SNPs with MAF ≥ 0.05 were included in the testing procedure. The empirical size was computed using the proportion of datasets (out of 5000) that had p-value ≤ 0.05.<SEP>4.2 Power Simulations<SEP>To compare the power of the kernel machine SNP-set test to the single SNP based min test, we considered the case where there is only one causal variant and simulated survival time T under the linear Cox model:  As in the size simulations, censoring times were generated from the exponential distribution with mean μC = 1, giving approximately 20%–22% censoring. The causal SNP was allowed to vary across all HapMap SNPs (including both typed and untyped SNPs) one at a time, however, only typed common SNPs with MAF ≥ 0.05 were included in the testing procedure. We used β = 0.2. This setting closely mirrors the usual GWAS setting in which the true causal SNP is often not genotyped but is captured only through LD with the typed SNPs. The empirical power was calculated using the proportion of datasets (out of 500) that had p-value ≤ 0.05. Note that both the kernel machine SNP-set test and the min test evaluate the global null hypothesis that none of the SNPs in the SNP-set is associated with survival, i.e. there is no association between survival and a SNP-set, e.g. a gene.<SEP>4.3 Power Simulations in the presence of epistasis<SEP>To compare the power of different kernels in the presence of epistasis, we generated survival time from the model  We considered several scenarios using the ASAH1 gene. The first scenario is that the two causal SNPs were set as the untyped SNPs rs4377998 and rs6586684 which are in low LD with each other (R2 = 0.392). The typed SNP rs1049874 has high LD with rs4377998 (R2 = 0.836). The type SNP rs10112857 has high LD with rs6586684 (R2 = 0.819). The second scenario sets the two causal SNPs to be one untyped SNP rs4377998 and one typed SNP rs10112857. The third scenario sets the two causal SNPs to be one untyped SNP rs6586684 and one typed SNP rs1049874. The fourth scenario sets the two causal SNPs to both typed (rs10112857 and rs1049874).<SEP>We then repeated this experiment for another two untyped SNPs, rs12541181 and rs2427746, which are also in low LD with each other (R2 = 0.422). The SNP rs12541181 is in high LD with the typed SNP rs7830490 (R2 = 0.986), and rs2427746 is in high LD with the typed SNP rs12155668 (R2 = 0.953).<SEP>4.4 Size and Power Simulations using imputed SNPs<SEP>A common current practice in GWAS is to impute all the HapMap SNPs using the typed SNPs and HapMap data. For this set of simulations, we restricted our attention only to SNPs that segregate in the CEU panel, which consists of 62 HapMap SNPs and 13 typed SNPs for the ASAH1 gene. We first simulated genotype data for all 62 SNPs in ASAH1 gene using HAPGEN (LD structure for simulated genotypes was based on the CEU population). We then used only the 13 typed SNPs to impute for all 62 SNPs in the ASAH1 gene using the program MaCH and the CEU HapMap reference panel. The imputed dataset consisting of both typed and imputed SNPs (in the form of dosage) was then used for testing for the gene effect. Again we restricted testing to common variants with MAF ≥ 0.05. No filtering of the imputed SNPs was necessary as the median estimated squared correlation between imputed and true genotypes was ≥ 0.5 for all SNPs (a cut-off of 0.3 will flag most poorly imputed SNPs). For size simulations, we generated survival times as was done in Section 4.1. Additionally, we compared the power of the kernel machine SNP-set test (linear kernel) to the single SNP based min test, where there is only one causal variant and simulated survival time T under the linear Cox model:  We varied the causal SNP one at a time across each of the 62 HapMap SNPs. The effective number of SNPs Neff was estimated using the most likely genotypes using the method. Note that the survival time was always simulated using the true genotype Zcausal, not the imputed genotype, but the testing procedure was applied to both typed and imputed SNPs.<SEP>6 Data Analysis<SEP>To illustrate the feasibility of our approach on real data, we applied our method to a prospective GWAS identifying genetic markers associated with the overall survival of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The study consists of two patient cohorts recruited from either the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, USA or the National Institute of Occupational Health in Oslo, Norway. DNA extracted from the tumor tissues of the patients were genotyped using the Affymetrix 250K Nsp GeneChip (262,264 SNPs). After quality control filtering, there were a total of 149037 SNPs. To identify genes that are associated with NSCLC overall survival, we applied the kernel machine SNP-set testing procedures. For each of the 149037 SNPs, we first imputed the missing genotypes for the missing individuals for each SNP by using the minor allele frequency of the SNP and assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the two cohorts separately. The two datasets were then combined. We then group the SNPs into SNP-sets based on genes and apply the kernel machine method. In addition to adjusting for study cohort, similar to, we adjusted for five additional covariates including age (in continuous scale), sex, clinical stage (as ordinal categories), cell type (squamous cell carcinoma vs. adenocarcinoma) and smoking pack-years (in continuous scale). 185 patients (96 from the MGH cohort and 89 from the Norway cohort) which were successfully genotyped and had complete information in the five covariates were used in the analysis. There were a total of 96 events out of the 185 patients.<SEP>We did the analysis using the linear, IBS and weighted IBS kernel (using inverse root MAF as weights). For comparison, we also report results from the min test, where we corrected the most significant p-value by the no. of SNPs using a Bonferroni correction. We restricted testing to SNP-sets that consists of at least two SNPs, giving a total of 6667 SNP-sets or genes. The top ten genes from each of the tests and the p-values obtained are shown in Table v. All four tests identified the same top gene. The top 10 genes identified from the IBS and weighted IBS kernels are largely identical, which is not surprising since testing was restricted only to common variants. The linear kernel gave a slightly different set of top 10 genes, but the top 10 genes identified from the linear kernel were generally highly ranked using the other two kernels. Likewise, the top 10 genes from IBS and weighted IBS kernels were also highly ranked by the linear kernel. In contrast, the top genes from the min test are quite different from the top genes identified from the kernel machine SNP-set tests. Using the Bonferroni correction (cut-off= 0.05/6667 = 7.5 × 10−6), none of the genes is significant. This is likely due to the small samples of the study. More research is needed in order to identify prognostic markers associated with NSCLC survival and validate these findings.","5 Simulation Results<SEP>The empirical Type 1 error rates at the nominal level of α = 0.05 are given in Table ii. The kernel machine SNP-set test had an appropriate size for all the three kernels and all genes considered. As a benchmark, we also report the empirical Type 1 error rate for the single SNP-based min test, which also gave the correct size.<SEP>Figure 1 plots the empirical power of the kernel machine SNP-set test (using the linear kernel) and the min test for the ASAH1 gene. The ASAH1 gene is on 8p22-p21.3 and consists of 86 HapMap SNPs and 14 typed SNPs on the Illumina HumanHap550 array. The SNP-set is formed by including only these 14 typed SNPs. In Figure 1, we allowed each of the 86 HapMap SNPs to be the true casual SNP one-at-a-time and computed the power of both the survival kernel machine SNP-set test and the min test. The ASAH1 gene region is made up of SNPs with a good correlation structure, in which the typed SNPs are typically in good LD with each other and with the causal SNPs. To understand better when the kernel machine method performs better than the min test, for each casual SNP, we calculated the median R2 (a commonly used LD measure) of the causal SNP with the typed SNPs using the program Haploview. From Figure 2, we can see that when the median R2 of the causal SNP with the typed SNPs is moderate, the kernel machine method always has higher power than the min test. Not surprisingly, when the median R2 of the causal SNP with the typed SNPs is low, both methods have low and comparable power at levels around the Type 1 error rate of 0.05. In Figure 3, we also plot the power of the IBS and weighted IBS kernel. The plot shows that even when the survival time is simulated assuming a linear model, a scenario where the linear kernel and min test are optimized, the IBS and weighted IBS kernel suffer from only a slight power loss.<SEP>We also investigated the conditions under which the min test has higher power than the kernel machine method using the NAT2 gene. NAT2 lies on 8p22 and has 22 HapMap SNPs and only 4 typed SNPs from the transcription start to end of the gene. The 4 typed SNPs are rs1390358, rs1112005, rs7832071 and rs1208 and are labeled as SNPs 7, 11, 13, 21 in Figure 4. The power of the kernel machine SNP-set test is higher than the min test for most SNPs. The power of the min test is higher than that of the kernel machine method at SNPs 2, 5, 9, 11, 20. A close examination of the LD plot will reveal that SNPs 2 (R2 = 0.83), 5 (R2 = 0.91), 9 (R2 = 0.99), 20 (R2 = 0.99) are in high LD with SNP 11 which is a typed SNP. Hence SNPs 2, 5, 9 and 20 will have similar results as SNP 11. Additionally, SNP 11 is also in weak LD with the remainder typed SNPs (R2 = 0.26 − 0.27). Hence when there is only a single true causal SNP that is typed and tested (or one in high LD with it is typed and tested) but not in LD with other typed SNPs, the min test might give higher power than the kernel machine method. However, such a setting is unlikely to happen frequently in an actual GWAS. In contrast, SNPs 7, 13 and 21 are in good LD with each other and when each of these SNPs are the true causal SNPs, the power of the kernel machine method is higher than the min test. For a much larger gene like FGFR2 (Figure 5), in regions of high LD, the kernel machine method again outperforms the min test. In regions of weak LD, the two methods have comparable power.<SEP>To illustrate how using MAF as weights in the weighted IBS kernel can upweight rare alleles, we present the empirical power for the HLA-B gene in Table iii. HLA-B gene is a part of a family of genes known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex and lies on 6p21.3. There are only 6 HapMap SNPs and 2 typed SNPs (rs1058026 and rs2523608) in the SNP-set. In Table iii, we simulated each of the 6 SNPs as the causal SNP. Since survival time was simulated by assuming a linear genetic effect, one would generally expect the power of the weighted IBS kernel to be no greater than that of the linear kernel, which corresponds to a Cox model with linear genetic effects of the SNPs. Of the two typed SNPs, rs1058026 and rs2523608, the former (0.118) has a lower MAF than the latter (0.478). When the SNP with the lower MAF was the causal SNP (rs1058026), the power of the weighted IBS kernel (0.358) was much greater than that of the linear kernel (0.214) and the IBS kernel (0.274). This is due to incorporating the information on the importance of rare variants into the kernel function. On the other hand, when the SNP with higher MAF was the causal SNP (rs2523608), the weighted IBS kernel (0.634) had a lower power than the IBS kernel (0.712) as the effect of the more common allele which is also the causal SNP was downweighted by the weighted IBS kernel.<SEP>Table iv shows the power for testing for the ASAH1 gene effect using the different kernels in the presence of epistasis. In the cases studied, the IBS kernel always has the highest power, and the weighted IBS kernel has similar power. Both the linear kernel and min test suffer from substantial power loss, which is not surprising given that they mis-specify the model. These results are consistent when the causal SNPs are typed, and when the causal SNPs are untyped and are in good LDs with the typed SNPs.<SEP>For simulations using imputed data, the empirical Type 1 error rates at the nominal level of α = 0.05 were 0.0566 and 0.0404 for the linear kernel and min test respectively. Figure 6 shows the empirical power of the kernel machine SNP-set test using the linear kernel and the min test for the overall effect of the ASAH1 gene based on imputed data. The conclusions are similar to before, specifically for a gene with a good LD structure like ASAH1 gene, the kernel machine SNP-set test outperforms the min test.","7 Discussions<SEP>In this article, we developed a more powerful alternative to the min test by accounting for LD among the typed SNPs. The kernel machine SNP-set test improves power by effectively utilizing the LD of the SNPs in the SNP-set and their correlation with untyped causal variants. Our approach offers a few practical advantages. Firstly, by grouping SNPs into SNP-sets based on some biological criteria, the results obtained are more easily interpretable. Secondly, our method is a multi-locus test that allows for multiple causal SNPs acting jointly. Thirdly, the kernel machine allows for easy adjustment of non-genetic covariates. Additionally, the kernel machine approach allows flexibility in modeling epistastic effects of SNPs, for example using the IBS kernel, without having to specify the functional form of the model. We considered in this paper both the linear kernel for the linear SNP effects and the IBS kernel to allow for SNP-SNP interactions in the SNP-set. Statistically choosing which kernel to use using the data is in fact a model selection problem, which is currently an active area of challenging statistical research with many open questions. More research is needed. Our experience suggests that the IBS kernel is a robust choice, in that it suffers a little loss in power when the effect of the SNP is linear, but is useful when the effects of the SNPs are more complex or when epistasis is present. However, the linear kernel is easier and faster to compute and works well if there is no strong evidence of epistatic effects.<SEP>If there is only one causal SNP that is genotyped and is uncorrelated with all the other typed SNPs, the min test may be more powerful, but such scenarios are uncommon, given the increasing number of SNPs that are genotyped in GWAS. Alternatively, one can also use a more powerful omnibus test, by taking the minimum p-value of the kernel machine SNP-set test and the min test, to cover both scenarios.<SEP>When a SNP-set associated with disease prognosis has been identified, there is often interest in identifying the causal variant(s). One could apply variable selection methods to the typed SNPs in the SNP-set to identify more “promising” SNPs, especially if there are many SNPs in the SNP-set. However such an approach is unsatisfactory since the true causal variant(s) is unlikely to have been genotyped, and the typed SNPs may all only be in partial LD with the causal variant(s). Thus to identify the causal variant(s), one would have to sequence the entire region. Alternatively, we need statistical methods that can effectively utilize known LD patterns in the human genome and the partial LD between typed SNPs and untyped causal variants to infer causal variant(s).",33957,['FOODAL']
30863922,"INTRODUCTION<SEP>Recent introduction of immune-checkpoint inhibition (ICI) treatments has significantly improved survival of patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma, which historically has accounted for 80% of skin cancer-related mortality. ICI induces immune activity by inhibiting two major immune-checkpoint proteins: CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) and PD-1 (Programmed cell death protein 1). While objective response rates vary depending on ICI treatment, a substantial fraction of patients do not respond to ICI (~85 % for anti-CTLA-4, −60% for anti-PD-1 and ~50% for combination regimens). Moreover, patients can develop severe or even fatal immune-related adverse events (irAEs), with unpredictable patterns, often resulting in discontinuation of treatment. There is a pressing need for an identification of reliable biomarkers for a more personalized stratification of patients benefiting from these therapies, which may point to novel molecular pathways to be targeted in improved combination regimens.<SEP>The currently proposed biomarkers of response and toxicity, such as serum markers, tumor mutation burden, tumor-associated PDL1, pre-existing CD8+ T cell infiltration in the tumor, repertoire of white blood cells (WBC) or host microbiota provide a modest level of predictive power, yet they are hampered by individual heterogeneity and a lack of specificity. Several studies have recently tested germline variants as more efficient and personalized predictive markers for both response and toxicity in ICI, in particular with anti-CTLA-4 treatments, Our study builds on the notion that ICI antagonizes immune-regulatory pathways and augments immune response for potent tumor surveillance. Since the role of the immune checkpoints in suppressing autoimmunity was being targeted for ICI therapy, it is highly plausible that ICI efficacy is modulated by patients’ underlying genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity, as also evidenced by autoimmune-like irAEs commonly observed in ICI, the occurrence of which may be associated with increased clinical response. The observed link between ICI, irAEs and treatment efficacy leads to our hypothesis that genetic risk factors of autoimmunity may affect ICI response, suggesting their potential utility as biomarkers of more personalized stratification of patients for ICI benefit. In this report, we have utilized findings from recently completed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on a spectrum of autoimmune diseases (See supplementary TableS1 for full references of autoimmune GWAS), and have tested well-established single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with autoimmunity risks in GWAS for their effect on ICI response in a cohort of patients treated by single line or combined ICI.","METHODS<SEP>Study population<SEP>The patient samples were collected through collaborative efforts among several institutions: New York University Langone Health (NYULH), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). All the patients in the study were treated for metastatic melanoma with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab, tremelimumab; N=215), anti-PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab; N=176) and combined anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1 (ipilimumab/nivolumab; N=45). Each patient provided blood samples for DNA extraction; demographic and clinical information including sex and age at treatment were also collected. All participants were of self-reported European ancestry.<SEP>Response status was assessed in all patients 13 weeks after initiation of treatment using established RECIST 1.1 (Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors) as described previously. In our study, clinical outcomes were classified into two categories: responders and non-responders. Responders consisted of patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), while patients with progression of disease (POD) were classified as non-responders.<SEP>Selection of Autoimmune Candidate Genetic Variants<SEP>From a comprehensive search of the published Genome Wide Association Studies (GWASs) performed on autoimmune diseases, we focused on variants that were associated with at least 3 autoimmune diseases, in which at least one association surpassed the GWAS level of significance (p=1E-07). In our selection, we have specifically focused on autoimmune traits that usually manifest as part of irAEs, including allergy, alopecia, ankyloses spondylitis, asthma, celiac disease, colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, pancreatitis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, system sclerosis, type 1 diabetes and vitiligo. Our final selection contained 25 SNPs to be tested in this study (Supplementary TableS1).<SEP>Genotyping and Quality Control (QC) analysis.<SEP>Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples using QiaAmp (Qiagen). The genotyping of 25 selected SNPs was performed using the Sequenom MassArray System (Agena Bioscience Inc,CA) as described elsewhere. Briefly, for quality control (QC), 8 sample duplicates were run along with 2 non-template controls in a 384-well plate. Concordance of duplicates observed was 99% and no cross-contamination was detected. We removed SNPs with genotype information missing in >15% of the samples or SNPs departing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p<0.001). After QC filters, 22, 24 and 23 SNPs remained in the analysis for response to anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and combination therapy, respectively. Patients with more than 10% of genotype information missing were also removed from the analysis, filtering out 1 anti-CTLA-4 and 1 anti-PD-1 treated patient. Following QC, 214 anti-CTLA-4, 175 anti-PD-1 and 45 combination therapy-treated patients remained in the final analysis.<SEP>Statistical Analysis<SEP>The statistical differences between patients’ demographical characteristics (sex and age) across treatment cohorts were assessed using Chi-square test for categorical variable (sex) and Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variable (age). Multiple logistic regression was conducted to investigate the association between selected SNPs and ICI response; a major allele was treated as a reference. Responders were defined as controls, while non-responders were classified as cases in all association tests. We used an additive model as a baseline analysis for all logistic regression tests. Where indicated, we also used dominant and recessive genetic models. In the dominant model, the presence of one or two copies of a minor allele was assumed to have the same effect, while in the recessive model, the carriers of at least one major allele were treated as a reference group, against minor allele homozygotes. We performed the analyses in anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and combination therapy-treated cohorts separately. We also conducted a pooled analysis of patients regardless of treatment types. The effect size of observed associations was reported as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (OR± 95%CI). We employed the Bonferroni method to adjust for multiple testing with a statistical significant threshold of p<0.002. As a secondary analysis, we also tested the interactions of the most significant variants with age and sex using logistic regression. All statistical models were adjusted for age at treatment, sex and treatment drugs (e.g. ipilimumab vs tremelimumab for the anti-CTLA-4 group and nivolumab vs pembrolizumab for the anti-PD-1 group), or treatment types for pooled analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed in R 3.5.1 and all analyses were conducted in PLINK 1.9.","RESULTS<SEP>Characteristics of study population<SEP>Our study employed 436 metastatic melanoma patients (Table 1). Among these, 215 patients received anti-CTLA-4 (171 ipilimumab and 44 tremelimumab); 176 anti-PD-1 (17 nivolumab, 159 pembrolizumab) and 45 combination therapies (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1). For anti-CTLA-4, 150 samples were obtained from patients treated at NYULH; 50 at UCLA and 15 at MGH. For anti-PD-1, 77 samples were obtained from patients treated at NYULH, 84 at UCLA and 15 at MGH; while for combination therapy (anti-CTLA-4/antiPD-1), 34 samples were obtained from patients at NYULH and 11 at MGH (Table1). The overall median age at treatment was 62.85 years (range: 19-90.20). A larger proportion of our patients were males (67%), consistent with the sex distribution of metastatic melanoma. The response rate for combination therapy was the highest (76.74%). For anti-CTLA-4- treated patients, the overall response rate was 36.91 %, while anti-PD-1 had 52.04% response rate. Some statistically significant difference has been observed between treatment cohorts for age of treated patients (p=0.02) (Table 1). Therefore, in subsequent analyses the effect of SNPs on ICI efficacy was tested separately in anti-CTLA, anti-PD1 and combination-therapy treated cohorts.<SEP>Analysis of association of 25 autoimmune risk SNPs with response in anti-CTLA-4<SEP>A total of 22 SNPs that passed QC (quality control) were tested for their association with response in 213 anti-CTLA-4 treated patients. Among those patients, 78 patients were responders (controls) and 135 were non-responders (cases) (Table 2). Both additive and recessive logistic regression models revealed several associations with response; however, none of these reached a level of statistical significance corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni adjustment (p<0.002) (supplementary Table S2), or a less stringent Holm-Bonferroni method. The most significant association with response in anti-CTLA-4-treated patients was found for rs1893217 under a dominant logistic model: our data showed that the carriers of at least one copy of a minor allele G (AG or GG) were 2.79 times more likely to be non-responders, compared to those with the homozygous reference genotype (AA) (95%CI= 1.36-5.73; p=0.005; Table 2). rs1893217 was mapped to the PTPN2 gene, and is associated with autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes (Supplementary Table S1). While this was the most significant association in the anti-CTLA-4 analysis, the statistical significance was marginal after adjustment for multiple testing by Bonferroni or Holm-Bonferroni methods (p-adjusted = 0.09). We also tested whether the association of rs1893217 with anti-CTLA-4 response was modified by age and sex and while the effect of rs1893217 was stronger in the younger age group (OR=6.43, 95% CI 1.7423.82), none of the interactions with age or sex was statistically significant (Figure S1).<SEP>Analysis of association of 25 autoimmune risk SNPs with response in anti-PD-1<SEP>For anti-PD-1 treatment, 24 SNPs passing QC were tested in 169 patients, of whom 88 were responders (controls) and 81 were non-responders (cases) (Table 2). An additive model revealed the most significant association with response for rs17388568 (OR=0.38; 95%CI=0.21-0.67; p=0.0008; Table 3; Full results in supplementary Table S2), significantly surpassing the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (p<0.002). Under the dominant regression model, consistent with the additive model, rs17388568 was found to have the strongest association with response (OR=0.26; 95%CI=0.12-0.53; p=0.0002; Table2), surpassing the Bonferroni multiple testing adjustment. In this analysis, carriers of at least one minor allele (GA or AA) of rs17388568 are 74% less likely to resist anti-PD-1 treatment, compared to those with GG genotype. rs17388568 was mapped to the genomic region containing IL2, ADAD1 and IL21, a locus previously associated with allergy, colitis and type 1 diabetes (Supplementary Table S1). The interaction analyses with age and sex for rs17388568 showed stronger effects in the younger female patients; yet, none of these associations was statistically significant (Figure S2).<SEP>Analysis of association of 25 autoimmune risk SNPs with response in combination therapy<SEP>In a cohort of 43 combination-therapy treated patients (N responders=controls=33, N non-responders=cases=10; Table2), none of the associations with the 23 SNPs tested reached statistical significance after adjustments for multiple testing with both the Bonferroni and Holm-Bonferroni methods (Full results Supplementary Table S2). However, due to the small sample size in the combination-therapy cohort, this analysis may have a limited power as evidenced by wide confidence intervals (Table2). Hence, the findings should be interpreted with caution. Finally, the pooled association analysis has been performed across treatments, grouping anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and combination-therapy treated patients together adjusted for age, sex and treatment drugs; no significant association with treatment response was observed (Supplementary Table S2).","DISCUSSION<SEP>Our study provides the first targeted analysis of the association of GWAS autoimmune germline genetic susceptibility loci and treatment efficacy in melanoma patients receiving immune-checkpoint inhibition (ICI). While there have been a handful of previous small-scale reports assessing the role of immune-related genetic variants in immunotherapy response, our study included relatively large cohorts of metastatic melanoma patients across different treatments and for the first time explored a link between genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity with ICI treatment outcomes. While only 25 SNPs were included in the analysis of our study, this subset was derived in a specifically focused manner, only targeting GWAS-level variants that were reproducibly associated with 3 or more autoimmune conditions, in particular those conditions that were similar to manifestations of ICI-related immune toxicity. Our analyses revealed significant associations with treatment efficacy, particularly for patients treated by anti-PD-1 (nivolumab, pembroluzimab).<SEP>The most significant association in our study was observed for rs17388568 with response to anti-PD-1. Our data showed that the carriers of a minor allele (A) of rs17388568 were 74% less likely to resist anti-PD-1 treatment (Table2). By inverting the odds ratio, the findings suggested that the minor allele A was associated with an increased ICI response; the carriers of A allele are 3.84 times more likely to respond to anti-PD-1 therapy (OR=1/0.26=3.84). This association was observed in both additive and dominant models with comparable association effects (OR=0.38; p=0.0008 and OR=0.26; p=0.0002, respectively) (Table2, Table3). In several autoimmune GWAS, a minor allele of rs17388568 (A) was found to be associated with higher risk of autoimmunity such as allergy, colitis and type 1 diabetes (Table4), suggesting a potential association of the A allele with increased immune activity. This is consistent with our findings showing that the carriers of the A allele of rs17388568 (susceptible for the risk of autoimmunity) associate with improved anti-PD-1 response. rs17388568 maps in the locus containing three candidate genes: ADAD1, IL2 and IL21 (Supplementary TableS1). Despite the direct mapping of rs17388568 in the intron of ADAD1 (adenosine deaminase containing domain 1), this candidate gene is mainly involved in testis development, with unclear functional relevance to autoimmunity or immune response in general. In contrast, IL2 and IL21 are both important signaling cytokines in adaptive immunity and previous analyses showed that both genes are contained within a linkage disequilibrium block with rs17388568, suggesting a possible correlation with other variants or functional effects in these two interleukin genes. IL2 is required for activation of both Th1 and Treg cells . While a direct link between IL-2 and response to anti-PD-1 therapy has not been systematically investigated, emerging evidence suggests that IL-2 production could overcome the PD-1-PDL-1 inhibitory pathway and can stimulate cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, one of the positive markers of anti-PD-1 response. Given this evidence, it is likely that the putative mechanism of the associations between rs17388568 and anti-PD-1 efficacy observed in this study is through IL2-mediated regulation of immune homeostasis, possibly upregulating the production of CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, IL-2 monotherapy was originally approved for melanoma due to its association with induced tumor regression, potentially through the increased CD8+ T cell activation. Additionally, there is an ongoing clinical trial for a combined IL2 and anti-PD-1 treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (Trial identifier: NCT02989714).<SEP>Another gene in the vicinity of rs17388568 is IL21 that also belongs to the gamma cytokine family. Numerous studies have reported the role of IL-21 in innate and adaptive immunity through the activation of JAK/STAT pathways and interestingly, patients with autoimmune diseases show elevated IL21 levels. IL-21 was also found to induce PD-1 expression in T cells, what may be a potential explanation of our observed association of rs17388568 with anti-PD-1 sensitivity. Several studies have observed suggestive clinical efficacy of combined IL-21 and anti-PD-1 therapy in preclinical mouse models, which was correlated with elevated tumor infiltrated CD8+ T cells and there are ongoing phase I clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and IL-21 for solid tumors. While these and other evidence clearly point to a potential biological link between rs17388568 and IL-2/IL21 genes in the locus, more detailed fine-mapping analysis of these associations will be needed. In particular, the correlation of rs17388568 and other potential variants in this region with gene expressions of both candidates will be needed to provide further functional evidence of the involvement of the genetic variants in this locus in modulation of anti-PD-1 efficacy.<SEP>Other associations were observed in this study, in particular for rs1893217 with response to anti-CTLA-4 ICI (OR=2.79; 95%CI= 1.36-5.73; p=0.005; Table 2). rs1893217 was mapped to PTPN2 (protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2). PTPN2 is a negative regulator in the JAK/STAT cascade inhibiting downstream cytokine signaling. Current research in anti-PD-1 treated mice suggested an association between PTPN2 deletions with improved response. While promising, however, the statistical significance in our study is borderline, and additional larger validation scanning will be needed to confirm these observations.<SEP>Our data did not find statistically significant interactions of the observed associations with age and sex. However, given recent suggestive evidence that age and sex modify ICI outcomes, these will need to be explored in larger patient cohorts.<SEP>In summary, we found a significant association of autoimmune genetic variants with ICI efficacy, particularly for anti-PD-1 treated patients, with a level of statistical significance surpassing adjustments for multiple testing. The findings generated here will be substantially enhanced by functional studies in order to fully understand the directionality and mechanisms of action of associated autoimmune genetic variants in the context of ICI outcome. Despite the current lack of such knowledge, our findings offer valuable insights on genetic markers potentially stratifying patients by treatment benefits using a simple method of SNP genotyping. These observations may stimulate more systematic efforts to assess genetic variants as putative personalized predictive biomarkers of ICI outcomes, by employing larger patient subsets from clinical trials and standard-of-care protocols, coupled with denser SNP arrays in an immune-related format or a genome-wide context. These efforts may substantially complement recent personalized strategies integrating known biomarkers of ICI outcomes, such as those proposed as part of cancer immunograms . A limitation of this report is that we did not assess immune-related toxicity in our patients, which is very relevant given the link to autoimmune genetic susceptibility. As the focus of the current study was on markers of ICI efficacy, the assessment of germline genetic risk variants of autoimmunity in relation to irAEs will be tested in a subsequent study in this patient cohort as well as expanded patient populations from multi-institutional collaborations.",20330,['FOODAL']
34488019,"Research in context<SEP>Evidence before this study<SEP>EBV infection appears to be necessary for the development of MS. Chromatin immunoprecipitation data indicated that the EBV transcription factor EBNA2 bound at MS risk loci very much more often than would be expected by chance and that risk loci were associated with gene expression, potentially dependent on the risk allele for six risk loci. This suggests EBNA2 may drive the association of these loci with MS susceptibility.<SEP>Added value of this study<SEP>We confirmed that EBNA2 binding at five of these six loci was allele dependent, and that inhibition of EBNA2 binding affected expression, including altering the association of the alleles with expression.<SEP>Implications of all the available evidence<SEP>These data, together with previously published findings on EBV and EBNA2, support the concept that EBNA2 binding, and so EBV infection, affects MS susceptibility. EBNA2 and EBV are therefore potential therapeutic targets to ameliorate this disease.<SEP>Alt-text: Unlabelled box<SEP>Introduction<SEP>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a gammaherpesvirus that establishes persistent infection in more than 90% of the global population, has been identified as a risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Nearly all patients with MS are seropositive for EBV. The risk for MS increases in people with high anti-EBV antibody titres or a history of the EBV syndrome infectious mononucleosis (IM). Similarly, in a study of 1047 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) cases, a condition which precedes MS, only one patient was seronegative for EBV antigens. There is evidence that EBV interacts with both genetic and environmental risk factors for MS. For example, the risk of MS for those with the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele who are positive for EBV infection is 14-fold higher in combination than due to each factor independently. EBV interaction with other environmental factors is suggested by the overlapping of genomic targets of the EBV viral transactivator protein, Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 2 (EBNA2) with those of the vitamin D receptor. Together these studies indicate that EBV is necessary, but insufficient on its own, to cause MS.<SEP>Host response to EBV infection could therefore contribute to differences in MS susceptibility, and genetic factors affecting this response could be those affecting MS risk. Hence a proportion of MS risk genes, genes that are proximal to MS risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), may contribute to MS pathogenesis through their effect on EBV infection of B cells, particularly through the latency III phase of EBV infection. Although >200 MS risk SNPs have been identified, and 47 of these have been implicated in EBV functions. any crosstalk between these MS risk SNPs/genes and EBV that would affect the risk of developing MS has yet to be clearly defined.<SEP>EBNA2 is essential for maintaining the latency III growth phase of EBV and acts through regulating both viral and cellular genes. EBNA2 mediates this regulation through interactions with human transcription factors, including RBP-Jκ and EBF1. While EBNA2 regulation of cellular gene expression promotes EBV survival, this and its manipulation of the host genome is implicated in affecting risk of lymphomas and several autoimmune conditions, including MS. Harley and colleagues identified several autoimmune disorders including MS which have an over-representation of EBNA2 binding sites at disease risk loci in EBV-infected B cells, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Using in silico data from heterozygotes, they identified many autoimmune-associated risk variants that are associated with altered EBNA2 binding to the human genome. They also provided evidence that EBNA2 affected the expression of the autoimmune disease risk gene CD44 in an allele dependent manner through such binding by an allele-specific qPCR method.<SEP>We previously found that 25% of MS risk loci (47 SNP-gene pairs) are associated with MS risk gene expression in LCLs. That is, they are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL): their gene expression is associated with the risk SNP genotype. Six of these SNPs were co-located with EBNA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) binding peaks. EBNA2 expression levels also correlated with the expression of these risk genes, usually dependent on risk genotype. These six SNPs are associated with the expression of seven MS risk genes, with expression associated with genotype differently in LCLs compared to other immune cells. We therefore hypothesised that the risk effect of these loci on MS could be mediated by allelic differences in EBNA2 binding, which affect host response to EBV and MS susceptibility.<SEP>To address this hypothesis, we aimed to answer two key questions (Fig. 1). Firstly, does EBNA2 bind in an allele-dependent manner at these six MS risk loci? Secondly, does EBNA2 regulate gene expression of these MS risk genes dependent on the risk allele? An allele-specific ChIP assay was devised to determine whether EBNA2 binds to MS risk loci in an allele-dependent manner. To test whether EBNA2 may regulate gene expression of these seven MS risk genes (from six risk loci) in LCLs, we used a specific EBNA2 inhibitory peptide, EBNA2-TAT, as previously described, and compared gene expression across genotypes with and without EBNA2 inhibition. EBNA2-TAT consists of a ten amino acid peptide from the RBP-Jκ interaction domain of EBNA2 fused with the protein transduction domain of HIV-1 TAT. The EBNA2-TAT peptide has been demonstrated to effectively inhibit EBNA2/RBP-Jκ interaction and reduce transcription of EBNA2 target genes.<SEP>This work demonstrates, for the first time, that EBNA2 binding to these MS risk loci is allele-dependent, affecting gene regulation and potentially the EBV phenotype of LCLs. This is consistent with the concept that EBV contributes to MS risk through this specific mechanism, and consilient with other data (reviewed by Bar-Or et al.), supporting the targeting of EBV and EBNA2 for therapeutic benefit in MS.","Methods<SEP>Ethics<SEP>Blood was collected by femoral phlebotomy from healthy individuals (numbers as described in the Results section for each experiment) after each gave informed consent (Westmead Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee Approval 1425). All participants reported being in good general health.<SEP>LCL generation and culture<SEP>Ficoll-Paque Plus (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) was used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from collected blood as previously described. The generation of LCLs was carried out as previously described. Briefly, PBMCs were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with supernatant from the EBV B95.8 cell line, after which the cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies), and 2 μg per ml cyclosporin A (Sigma Aldrich). The cells were plated at densities of 2.5 × 106 or 5 × 106 cells per well in 48-well plates. The media was supplemented weekly until the cells were expanded into a 25 cm2 flask. LCLs were used then cryopreserved in 10% DMSO (MP Biomedical, Irvine, CA, USA) 50% FBS and RPMI-1640. The LCLs undergo routine mycoplasma testing.<SEP>LCL Proliferation<SEP>Proliferation assays were carried out using alamarBlue (Thermo Fisher) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of fluorescence was read with excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm using a SpectraMax iD5 plate reader, 3 hr after the addition of alamarBlue reagent at a volume equivalent to 10% of the total volume.<SEP>MS risk genotyping<SEP>For genotyping, DNA was extracted from whole blood samples using Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNA samples were genotyped for MS associated SNPs (listed in Supplementary Table 1) using Taqman Assays (Supplementary Table 2) and Taqman Genotyping Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<SEP>RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis<SEP>Total RNA was isolated from LCLs using a Bioline Isolate II RNA Mini Kit (Meridian Bioscience, Memphis, TN, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After treatments or incubation periods, cells were washed in DPBS and resuspended in 100 μL RLY Buffer provided in the kit. The samples were snap-frozen and stored at -80⁰ C until required. Samples were thawed on ice and 100 μL of RLY Buffer and 2 μl of TCEP was added to samples and vortexed vigorously. The remaining steps for RNA extraction followed the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was checked for quality and quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). cDNA was synthesised using qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences, Beverly, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<SEP>Gene expression<SEP>For the detection of MS risk genes, cDNA was used to detect expression of MS risk genes by real time PCR using predesigned TaqMan gene expression assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and TaqMan Universal Master Mix II, with UNG, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression was measured using the 2−ΔΔCT method as previously described, using RPL30 as the reference gene. The probes are listed in Supplementary Table 3.<SEP>Viral gene expression<SEP>For the detection of expression of LMP1 expression, 3 µL of diluted cDNA used with SYBR primer sets and Takara SYBR Pre-Mix Master Mix (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan). Forward and reverse primers were used at a final concentration of 0·2 μM with 6 µL of SYBR mix. RPL30 was used as the reference gene. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 4.<SEP>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)<SEP>30 × 106 cells were prepared for shearing using the TruChIP Chromatin Shearing Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Covaris, Sydney, NSW, Australia) with some modifications. An additional crosslinking step of EBNA2 to its transcriptional complexes was added prior to the fixation step as described by the manufacturer. Disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to fix protein-protein interactions. DSG was freshly prepared with DMSO to provide a 200mM solution and added to cells for a final concentration of 2mM. The samples were rotated for 5 minutes at room temperature (RT). After washing, formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1% for an additional 1 minute with agitation at RT. Following this, 87 μL of Quenching Buffer E was added and placed on rocker at RT for 5mins, after which all steps were completed according to the TruChIP manufacturer's guidance for “high cell” quantity. An E220 Evolution Ultrasonicator (Covaris) was used to shear the chromatin with the conditions recommended by the manufacturer for target size of 200-700bp (5% duty cycle, 140 peak power, and 200 bursts per cycle) for 12 min. Sheared chromatin was precleared with 45 μL of Protein G Agarose at 4°C for 45 min. Cleared sonicate was incubated with 10 μg anti-EBNA2 (U.S. Biological, Salem, MA, USA, Cat. No. 376310) or the same volume of isotype control antibody overnight, after which 20 µlitres of a 50% slurry of Protein G PLUS Agarose (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA, Cat. No. sc-2002) was added and incubated at 4⁰ C with rotation for 1 hr. The beads were then washed sequentially with 1mL volumes of wash buffers, each time rotated for 5 mins at 4⁰ C, followed by a spin at 1000 x g at 4⁰ C, except where noted. In order, the buffers used were: low salt buffer, high salt buffer, lithium chloride buffer (3 min, no rotation, kept on ice), TE buffer (two washes) (Buffer details, Supplementary Table 5). Then 250 μL of elution buffer (TE with 1% SDS) was added to the beads and they were incubated for 20 min at 65⁰ C, with regular gentle vortexing. Samples were then spun at 14,000 x g and the supernatant was removed. DNA was extracted using the QiaQuick PCR purification kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The samples were eluted in 60 μL buffer EB and stored at -20⁰ C prior to ChIP PCR. The anti-EBNA2 antibody used in this work has been previously validated for use in chIP studies.<SEP>Allele-specific ChIP-qPCR<SEP>An allele-specific PCR-based technique was applied to assess differential EBNA2 enrichment at heterozygous alleles, as previously described. Two primer sets were needed for each locus, with the same forward primer for each set. For reverse primers, the sequences are the reverse complement of the sequence which follows the variant in the DNA. The last base in the primer is specific to the allele. The primer sets for each SNP were tested with verified genotyped DNA. The primers are listed in Supplementary Table 6.<SEP>To quantify allele specific protein binding we performed qPCR using Takara SYBR Pre-Mix Master Mix as outlined above. Standard curves were created for each primer set using genomic DNA heterozygous for the SNP. The Ct values of the ChIP DNA were then used to extrapolate the relative DNA quantity from the standard curve.<SEP>EBV DNA copy number measurement<SEP>For detection of EBV DNA copy number, cells were removed from culture after the treatment periods, washed with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), and the pellets stored at -80⁰ C. DNA was extracted from cells using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were eluted with 60 µL elution buffer.<SEP>EBV DNA copy number was detected by Quantitative PCR using a previously described primer set and probe for an EBV genome-specific repeat region to detect EBV DNA copy number. Real-time PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad CFX384 qPCR System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) using the same conditions as previously described. A primer set for the single copy gene TTR was used as a reference to account for any DNA concentration variation between samples (Supplementary Table 7). The relative DNA copy number was calculated as the with the 2−ΔΔCT method as previously described.<SEP>eQTL data for B cells and LCLs<SEP>The eQTL data for these SNP:gene pairs in B cells (n=91) and LCLs (n=147) were obtained from DICE and GTEx datasets, respectively. DICE is a publicly available database providing gene expression, eQTLs and epigenomic data for 15 immune cell types (https://dice-database.org). GTEx portal is a publicly available resource providing the eQTL and RNA-seq based gene expression data for 54 different tissues derived from nearly 1000 healthy donors (www.gtexportal.org). The direction of eQTLs was adjusted by the risk allele effect on gene expression relative to protective allele.<SEP>Statistics<SEP>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8 unless otherwise stated. For normally distributed data, comparison of the mean between the two groups was done using a parametric test; either a paired two-tailed t-test; or an unpaired two-tailed t-test. For normally distributed data, comparison of the mean between two groups was done using a parametric test, for paired samples a paired t-test (two-tailed), for unpaired samples, an unpaired t-test (two-tailed). For data that was not normally distributed, a non-parametric test was performed, a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test for paired samples, and a Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples. The data for the allele-specific ChIP-PCR was not normally distributed, and therefore a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was performed to compare the relative EBNA2 binding between the risk and protective alleles among heterozygous samples. For the gene expression analysis of the MS risk genes, the data was not normally distributed, therefore a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was performed on paired samples and a Mann-Whitney U test was performed on unpaired samples. The data for LCL proliferation was normally distributed and therefore a paired t-test (two-tailed) was performed to compare the untreated group with EBNA2-TAT-treated groups.<SEP>Role of funding source<SEP>The funding sources did not influence design, data collection, data analyses, interpretation, or writing of this report.","Results<SEP>EBNA2 binds chromatin at MS risk loci dependent on risk allele<SEP>We undertook ChIP for EBNA2 in 33 samples, analysing LCLs by an allele-specific ChIP-PCR method. As both alleles are available for binding of the transcription factor, by comparing the binding at both alleles within a sample heterozygous for a given SNP, these samples provide a natural internally matched control, with improved control for batch effects and technical variability, since the only variable that has changed is the allele. Of the six MS risk SNPs (all previously identified as eQTLs in LCLs, with evidence implicating EBNA2 binding) investigated, EBNA2 was found to bind dependent on MS risk allele at five loci (Fig. 2, p < 0·05). It bound preferentially to the risk allele of two loci, TRAF3/RCOR1 (rs1258869, p < 0·05) and CD40 (rs1883832, p < 0·05); and the protective allele of three loci, TNFAIP8 locus (rs32658, p < 0·001), TNFRSF1A locus (rs180069, p < 0·05) and TBX6 (rs3809627, p < 0·05) (two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test performed for all comparisons).<SEP>EBNA2-TAT inhibits the EBV latency III growth program<SEP>We next investigated EBNA2-TAT effects on the LCL EBV latency III growth program since we previously reported LCL proliferation is associated with expression of several MS risk genes. We performed a dose-response experiment to find the optimal concentration of EBNA2-TAT that inhibits EBNA2 transcriptional function and affects MS risk genes without excess cytotoxicity. We treated LCLs with increasing concentrations of EBNA2-TAT over 24 hr. LCL proliferation was reduced significantly by all concentrations tested with 50µM reducing LCL proliferation by 40% (Fig. 3a, p < 0·01), 100µM by approximately 50% (p < 0·001), and 200µM by over 50% (p < 0·001) (two-tailed paired t-test). The cell morphology was also affected by increasing concentrations of EBNA2-TAT (Fig. 3b). Expression of the EBNA2 regulated EBV gene LMP1 was reduced significantly by EBNA2-TAT at 50µM at 24 hr (Fig. 3c, p < 0·05). The reduction in LMP1 was greater at 24 hr than at 48 hr (Supplementary Fig. 1) (two-tailed paired t-test). Taken together, this indicates significant disruption of the EBV latency III growth program by EBNA2-TAT 50 μM at 24 hr, and therefore these treatment conditions were chosen for the subsequent experiments. The cellular uptake of EBNA2-TAT and its specific binding to the RBP-Jκ site on EBNA2 has been previously confirmed through fluorescein labelling and in vitro GST affinity assay, respectively. We confirmed the previously shown finding that treatment with a mutant peptide of EBNA2-TAT (with a 2 amino acid substitution) had no inhibitory effects on EBNA2 function, no effects on cell viability or growth or have any effect cell morphology (Supplementary Fig. 3) indicating that inhibition of the EBNA2 interaction with RBP-Jκ is responsible for the effects of the EBNA2-TAT.<SEP>Inhibition of EBNA2 alters MS risk gene expression in LCLs<SEP>We next treated our cohort of 35 LCLs with the optimum treatment of EBNA2-TAT (50 µM for 24 hr). Of the seven MS-associated genes tested, gene expression of five was significantly affected by EBNA2 inhibition (Fig. 4), TRAF3 (p < 0·05), CD40 (p < 0·001), CLECL1 (p <0·0001), TNFAIP8 (p < 0·001), and TNFRSF1A (p < 0·001) (two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). Expression of two genes was not affected by EBNA2-TAT treatment: TBX6 and RCOR1. The reduced risk gene expression on EBNA2 inhibition for CD40, CLECL1 and TNFAIP8 suggests this transcription factor increases expression of these risk genes in LCLs. Conversely, these data suggest EBNA2 inhibits expression of TNFSF1A and TRAF3 in LCLs.<SEP>The effect of EBNA2 inhibition and the six MS risk loci on EBV DNA Copy number in LCLs<SEP>EBV DNA copy number is a stable phenotype in LCLs. We previously demonstrated that several MS risk SNPs and genes are associated with EBV DNA copy number. We assessed the EBV DNA copy number for untreated and EBNA2-TAT treated LCLs (n=35). The TNFAIP8 locus demonstrated a genotype effect on EBV DNA copy number in untreated LCLs (Supplementary Fig. 5, p < 0·05, Mann-Whitney U test), and this genotype effect was ablated upon EBNA2-TAT treatment.<SEP>Is the EBNA2 effect on gene expression at MS risk loci dependent on genotype?<SEP>Since EBNA2 was demonstrated to bind one allele more than the other, we expected that EBNA2 would alter the allelic association with expression compared to that found in B cells. This was true for TRAF3, CD40, TNFAIP8, TNFRSF1A, TBX6 and RCOR1, but not CLECL1 (Fig. 5a). EBNA2 bound preferentially to the risk allele for TRAF3, and that allele had lower expression. It bound to the protective allele for CD40, TNFAIP8 and TNFRSF1A; and in each case that allele had relatively lower expression. However, from the effect of EBNA2-TAT inhibition on expression, we can deduce that EBNA2 increases the expression of CD40, CLECL1, and TNFAIP8; and decreases the expression of TRAF3 and TNFRSF1A. This suggests that while altering gene expression in one direction, it can alter the relative allelic expression in the same direction (TRAF3, TNFRSF1A) or in the alternate direction (CD40, TNFAIP8). The effect on expression due to EBNA2 preferential binding is the effect that would be expected to confer increased immune evasion if the EBNA2 binding is the basis for the increased MS risk.<SEP>Does the EBNA2 interaction with MS risk alleles increase host immune evasion?<SEP>EBNA2 interacts with MS risk loci, dependent on genotype (Fig. 2). The direction of effect on risk gene expression can be inferred from the alteration in the relative allelic expression in LCLs compared to uninfected B cells (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 8). Each of these MS risk genes have putative functions in the EBV latency III program proximal to LMP1 and LMP2 signalling. On the basis of the inferred EBNA2 effect on expression and risk allele preference, we have postulated the effect of the EBNA2/risk gene interaction on the program, and so evasion of the host immune response (Fig. 5b). The effect of EBNA2/risk gene interaction is to increase gene expression (CLECL1, TNFAIP8, TNFRSF1A) or decrease expression (TRAF3, CD40, RCOR1), as described in Fig. 5b. In each case, there are plausible explanations for an enhanced EBNA2 function on the latency III infection cycle through its regulation of these risk genes.","Discussion<SEP>In this study we sought to determine if EBNA2 regulates MS risk gene transcription in EBV infected B cells through an allelic imbalance in binding at MS risk loci. We had earlier identified six risk loci which were eQTLs in LCLs, and for which we had preliminary ChIP-seq evidence of binding by EBNA2 at the risk SNP itself. We confirm that EBNA2 binds at least five of the six MS risk loci with allelic imbalance, and that inhibition of EBNA2 alters expression of five of these genes. The association of the risk alleles with expression in LCLs compared to that seen in uninfected B cells or blood cells was altered by this allelic preference. These data therefore provide evidence for EBNA2 interacting directly with these risk loci, affecting their expression and so function in these EBV infected cells. These genes all function on proximal pathways important in EBV immortalisation, and so likely affect the survival of EBV infected B cells in the host. This is consistent with a role for these risk alleles in altering MS susceptibility and/or progression through altering EBV susceptibility to its host. This work, confirms the allelic imbalance in EBNA2 binding identified in ChIP-seq studies, using much larger sample numbers, and indicates the consequence of that interaction from binding inhibitor studies and investigations of eQTL changes.<SEP>The risk SNP could alter the binding of the EBNA2 transcription factor complexes in a number of ways: directly altering the stochiochemistry of the DNA:transcription factor protein complex; altered comparative binding to competing transcription factor complexes; and/or altering epigenetic factors such as methylation and chromatin states. In each case, the altered EBNA2 allelic preference would be associated with the risk locus in a way that could drive altered disease risk due to the genetic effect of the locus.<SEP>Despite the increasing evidence implicating EBNA2 in MS in recent years. the extent to which EBNA2 drives the association of SNPs with expression at MS risk loci in LCLs, which in turn affects EBV evasion of host immune responses and MS susceptibility, has remained unknown. Such evidence would support investigations into whether inhibition of EBNA2 might be a useful approach for the treatment of MS. In support of that, it is important to address what the likely consequences of the EBNA2 regulation of these MS risk genes would be in EBV latency III. EBNA2 can increase or decrease transcription. It typically increases transcription of target genes by binding to corepressor complexes, such as through RBP-Jκ. However, its interactions with other EBV factors (notably EBNA3, usually antagonistic to EBNA2, which itself forms complexes with the MS risk gene BATF and human transcription factors (notably EBF1) could result in complex effects on expression, that may even be different between individuals, and dynamic through infected cells over time. Only about 80% of EBNA2 binding sites are also RBP-Jκ sites, the remainder would not be directly affected by the EBNA2-TAT inhibitor. Since these six MS risk loci all bound EBNA2 and expression was affected by EBNA2-TAT inhibition of the EBNA2/RBP-Jκ interaction for five of them (not TBX6), it seems likely EBNA2/risk loci binding were all at colocalisation sites for the two transcription factors. From empirical evidence of effect on expression of the risk SNP in LCLs we can infer if the EBNA2 allele preference increases or decreases expression (Fig. 5).<SEP>In general, EBNA2 manipulation of the MS risk loci studied here can be plausibly linked to enhanced EBV survival, which could increase MS susceptibility (Fig. 5b). Immune control of infected B cells is both intracellular, through antiviral pathways such as the interferon response pathway; and extracellular, predominantly due to recognition of infected cells by CD8 T cells and NK cells. Further, evasion of B cell checkpoints in clonal proliferation may be crucial to disease progress, and this may also be affected by the interaction between MS risk alleles, EBNA2 regulation, and host immune response. Notably, three of these risk loci (TNFRSF1A, TRAF3, TBX6) are amongst the most mutated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumours, another EBV associated disease. Risk loci for CD40, TRAF3, TNFRSF1A and CLECL1 are associated with other EBV implicated autoimmune diseases, and associated with lymphocyte numbers (GWAS catalog, Supplementary Table 9).<SEP>Genes can have multiple functions, in part due to the balance of interactions with other genes in the infected cell. We had previously suggested that lower TRAF3 expression and lower CD40 expression promoted EBV infected B cell survival: less TRAF3 by less inhibition of the TRAF6 pathway/upregulation of the interferon response pathway, less CD40 would lead to less competition with LMP1, the viral homologue of CD40. This is consistent with the effect of allelic preference by EBNA2 identified here. RCOR1 (shared locus with TRAF3) is a corepressor that controls cell proliferation, so that the lower expression seen for the preferred EBNA2 allele may indicate less inhibition of proliferation of infected B cells. The transcription factor TBX6 is known to increase NOTCH1 signalling which means it could be expected to upregulate LMP1 and LMP2A, and the higher allelic expression on EBNA2 binding is consistent with increased NOTCH1 signalling being favourable for the virus. TNFAIP8 and TNFRSF1A both interact with NF-κB signalling. TNFAIP8 is upregulated by NF-κB and can inhibit or promote apoptosis. TNFRSF1A interacts directly with the NF-κB complex. To be consistent with the concept that preferential EBNA2 binding promotes immune evasion for these risk genes, this suggests the direction of effect on the target pathways depends on interactions with other regulators of these pathways. CLECL1 is a transmembrane C type lectin of largely unknown function. Related C type lectins play key roles in response to infection. Our data suggests higher expression, or other EBNA2 transcriptional effects, increases immune evasion through the net function of this gene. EBV antibodies are elevated in MS associated with the MS risk allele HLA DRB1:1501. Specific testing of the effect of the risk loci investigated here on T/NK control, B cell phenotypic features, EBV viral load, and EBV antibodies may clarify the relative importance of these processes in host response to EBV and to disease risk.<SEP>For a number of reasons, EBNA2 regulation of these MS risk genes might not be the basis for their association with MS. The MS risk genes have other roles which could drive MS risk, especially in B cells, so that attributing the basis for the allelic associations with disease is challenging. Further, it is difficult to delineate the EBNA2 specific effects on gene transcription from that of other EBV and host factors. Also, the capture of the host B cell antigen proliferation pathways by EBNA2 likely involves interactions with some host polymorphisms that have little effect on EBV infection, although this is less likely where the SNPs are also associated with MS. The consequences of the allelic imbalance on binding are likely to extend beyond affecting expression levels, as splicing, timing of response, conditions used for testing response and inhibition, and interaction with other genes and genetic variants are all likely to be important. Further, the statistical power to evaluate these effects requires much larger samples than were available for this study. Finally, as the MS risk alleles have been identified in Caucasian samples, and EBV strains are different in Africa and potentially Asia, our findings might not be representative of EBV effects on MS in these populations.<SEP>However, these studies do further implicate EBV and EBNA2 in MS pathogenesis. The empirical consequences of inhibiting EBNA2 need to be further evaluated in LCLs, and in the mouse model of EBV infection and MS. EBNA2 drives EBV latency III, further supporting the role of this EBV stage in MS. However, the consequences in inhibiting this stage when disease has developed (‘the horse has bolted’) will be difficult to answer but may be investigated with mouse models. Finally, EBNA2 genomic targets overlap with those of the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D is implicated in MS pathogenesis, and many genes regulated by it are MS risk genes, implicating interaction between these two environmental factors, EBV and vitamin D, in MS aetiology.<SEP>In summary, these data are consistent with the concept that EBV contributes to MS risk through the interaction of EBNA2 with MS risk alleles and indicate that targeting of EBNA2 in MS could be a promising therapeutic strategy. EBNA2 could be targeted to alter MS risk gene expression, or more broadly, due to its essential role in latency III maintenance, could be used to deplete EBV-infected B cells. This work also provides further insights into poorly understood mechanisms through which environmental factors can interact with human genetic factors to alter human disease. In addition to EBV, similar approaches to more clearly understand allelic imbalance in MS could focus on other environmental factors such as the Vitamin D receptor interaction at MS risk loci.<SEP>Contributors<SEP>JTK, DRB, AA and GPP devised the experiments.

24244288,"Introduction<SEP>As a routine therapeutic agent, aspirin is prescribed widely for the prophylaxis of cardio-thrombotic events. The effect of aspirin is achieved by suppressing thromboxane production and further by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. However, a considerable number of patients on aspirin therapy fail to reach this desired effect, and instead they experience major adverse vascular events, a phenomenon known as ‘aspirin insensitivity’. Since the discovery of this phenomenon, to unravel the underlying mechanisms of aspirin insensitivity so far remains a daunting task. Evidence is mounting suggesting that a strong genetic component underlies aspirin insensitivity. Literature, being abundant with candidate gene association studies, paves the way to determine how many genes and which genetic determinants are actually predisposing an individual to aspirin insensitivity. However, the resultant associations are often not reproducible, likely due to the divergent ethnicity-specific genetic profiles, the population stratification and cryptic relatedness, the inadequate sample sizes, and the lack of adjustment for confounders.<SEP>To shed some light on this issue, we sought to evaluate the association of four common polymorphisms (rs3842787: 50C→T, rs20417: 765G→C, rs201184269: 1565T→C, rs1126643: 807C→T) with the risk of having aspirin insensitivity by conducting a meta-analysis of individual participant data from all qualified case-control studies. The four polymorphisms examined are mapped separately on four candidate genes: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1, chromosome 9q32-q33.3), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, chromosome 1q25.2-q25.3), integrin, alpha 2b (ITGA2B, chromosome 17q21.32) and integrin alpha 2 (ITGA2, chromosome 5q11.2).<SEP>The selection of the four candidate genes is based on their pathogenic roles in platelet regulation. In brief, aspirin is reported to inhibit platelets by acetylating COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, and further to block the production of thromboxane A2, a platelet agonist. Especially, thromboxane A2, via transmitting intracellular signals into platelet, can activate the ITGA2B receptor, a platelet-membrane glycoprotein important for platelet aggregation. ITGA2 serves as the platelet receptor of collagen that is a physiologically important activating agent of platelet aggregation. Moreover, the selection of these four polymorphisms is based on the fact that if there are three or more independent studies investigating the same polymorphism in aforementioned four genes, data were synthesized accordingly.","Methods<SEP>Meta-analysis of observational studies has particular challenges owing to the inherent biases and drawbacks in study design. We therefore carried out this meta-analysis according to the guidelines set forth by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement (See Checklist S1, PRISMA checklist).<SEP>Search<SEP>PubMed, Wanfang (http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn) and China Biological Medicine (CBM) (http://sinomed.imicams.ac.cn/index.jsp) databases were searched for articles published in English or Chinese language before May 2013.<SEP>Eligibility of the retrieved articles was evaluated by reading the titles and the abstracts if necessary. Additional evaluation was extended by reviewing the bibliographies of articles and relevant reviews. The most compete and recent results were abstracted in case of multiple publications from the same study group. Articles with data on both aspirin resistance and semi-resistance were treated separately.<SEP>All qualified articles in the meta-analysis were approved by the ethics committee of each study, and written informed consents were obtained from all subjects before enrollment.<SEP>Inclusion/exclusion criteria<SEP>Articles were included if (i) they evaluated the association of at least one of four polymorphisms (rs3842787, rs20417, rs201184269, rs1126643) with the risk of having aspirin insensitivity; (ii) they were conducted on a case-control or nested case-control study design; (iii) they provided the genotype and/or allele counts of examined polymorphisms between patients with aspirin insensitivity and controls in order to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).<SEP>Articles were excluded if (i) they did not provide the genotype or allele counts of examined polymorphisms; (ii) they lacked either patient group or control group; (iii) they were experimental investigations or clinical trials; (iv) they were meeting abstracts, case reports/series, editorials, review articles, or non-English and non-Chinese publications.<SEP>Data extraction<SEP>Data were extracted independently by two authors (Zhiyuan Weng and Wenquan Niu) on a standardized Excel template and were verified with disagreements settled by consensus.<SEP>From each article, information was extracted on the first author, publication year, ethnicity, type of aspirin insensitivity (aspirin resistance and aspirin semi-resistance), study design, the genotypes/alleles of examined polymorphisms, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), platelet number, as well as the percentages of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD).<SEP>Statistical analysis<SEP>Data management and statistical analyses were conducted using STATA software version 11.2 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA) for Windows. Risk estimate was expressed as OR with 95% CI. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested by χ2 test or Fisher's exact test if necessary.<SEP>The random-effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird method was adopted. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by χ2 test and was quantified using the I 2 statistic (ranging from 0 to 100%), which is defined as the percentage of the observed between-study variability that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. Met-regression analyses were conducted to estimate the potential confounding of risk factors such as age and gender.<SEP>Publication bias was assessed using the Egger regression test. The Egger's test detects Begg's funnel plot asymmetry by determining whether the intercept deviates significantly from zero in a regression of the standardized effect estimates against their precision. Significance was judged at P<0.05 except for the I 2 statistic and Egger's test at P<0.1.","Results<SEP>Qualified articles<SEP>The initial search retrieved 154 potentially relevant references (118 published in English and 36 in Chinese). Applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria left 21 qualified articles, in which the association of four examined polymorphisms with aspirin insensitivity was examined.<SEP>A flow diagram schematizing the selection process of identified articles with specific reasons, and the baseline characteristics of all qualified articles are presented in Figure 1 and Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The retrieved articles were published between 2003 and 2012, and 11 of them were written in Chinese and 10 in English. There were a total of 4, 6, 10 and 7 qualified articles and 353/595, 344/698, 588/878 and 209/676 cases/controls for rs3842787, rs20417, rs20118426 and rs1126643, respectively. Five articles that reported both aspirin resistance and semi-resistance were treated separately. Therefore, there were 26 comparisons in final analysis.<SEP>Study characteristics<SEP>17 of 26 comparisons involved Chinese subjects (12 from north China and 5 from south China), 7 involved Caucasians, and 2 involved the mixed populations. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed for rs20118426 and rs1126643 in 2 comparisons, respectively.<SEP>The risk-allele frequencies of rs3842787, rs20417, rs20118426 and rs1126643 were respectively 3.93%, 20.36%, 11.82% and 50.67% in patients, and 4.07%, 12.16%, 11.71% and 30.4% in controls. By ethnicity, the risk-allele frequencies of rs3842787, rs20417, rs20118426 and rs1126643 were respectively 11.64%, 25.0%, 16.09% and 40.77% in Caucasian patients and 11.99%, 9.38%, 17.41% and 32.55% in Caucasian controls, and the corresponding frequencies were respectively 0.08%, 19.59%, 6.17% and 58.58% in Chinese patients and 10.82%, 12.62%, 3.88% and 28.69% in Chinese controls.<SEP>Overall analyses<SEP>Taking all available comparisons together for each polymorphism observed significant association of COX-2 gene rs20417 and ITGA2 gene rs1126643 with aspirin insensitivity, whereas no significance was found for COX-1 gene rs3842787 and ITGA2B gene rs201184269 under both allelic and dominant models (Table 3). For instance, risk estimates conferred by rs1126643-T allele reached as high as 2.37 (95% CI: 1.44–3.89; P = 0.001) for the occurrence of aspirin insensitivity relative to the alternative allele, and this estimation was more prominent under dominant model (OR = 2.81; 95% CI: 1.54–5.13; P = 0.001), despite marked between-study heterogeneity (P<0.01 for I 2) and low probability of publication bias as reflected by Egger's test (P>0.2). It is also worth mentioning that the significant association of rs20417 with aspirin insensitivity was immune from the disturbance of heterogeneity and publication bias. In addition, excluding comparisons with genotypes deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium yielded almost similar results (Table 3).<SEP>Subgroup analyses<SEP>To estimate the influence of categorical confounders, separate analyses were performed within strata involving two or more comparisons (Table 3). By type of aspirin insensitivity, data were insufficient for rs3842787, rs20417 and rs20118426 to assess their associations with aspirin semi-resistance. For rs1126643, risk estimates was remarkably potentiated among patients with aspirin semi-resistance compared with those with aspirin resistance, especially under dominant model (aspirin semi-resistance: OR = 5.44; 95% CI: 1.42–20.83; P = 0.013 versus aspirin resistance: OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.07–3.6; P = 0.03). Heterogeneity was improved greatly for aspirin resistance comparisons.<SEP>Further grouping articles by ethnicity of study populations (mainly Chinese and Caucasian) observed the enhanced prediction of all examined polymorphisms except for rs20417 in Chinese compared with Caucasians (Table 3). Take rs1126643 for example, the odds of aspirin insensitivity in Chinese was nearly threefold relative to in Caucasians under both allelic (OR: 3.58 versus 1.29) and dominant (OR: 4.98 versus 1.49) models. However, a note of caution should be added because heterogeneity might potentially restrict the interpretation of risk estimates in Chinese (allelic model: I 2 = 76.5% and dominant model: I 2 = 51.0%).<SEP>Meta-regression analyses<SEP>To further explore other potential sources of heterogeneity, a multivariable meta-regression model incorporating available study-level continuous covariates was conducted. Differences in percentage of CAD between patients and controls explained a large part of heterogeneity for rs20417 (P = 0.034). Moreover, averaged platelet number was a significant source of heterogeneity for rs1126643 (P = 0.012).","Discussion<SEP>The most noteworthy finding of this meta-analysis was that COX-2 and ITGA2 genetic defects might increase the risk of having aspirin insensitivity, especially for aspirin semi-resistance and in Chinese populations. However, these significant associations were resulted from pooling a small number of studies with limited sample sizes, and therefore our findings must be interpreted with caution.<SEP>Aspirin insensitivity is a poorly characterized phenomenon in both clinical and laboratory contexts. Although the laboratory diagnosis of aspirin insensitivity cannot substitute clinical diagnosis, there is every reason to believe that most if not all laboratory assays do reflect some rationale and degree of validity and sensitivity, albeit variable, of such insensitivity. If not, any real aspirin insensitive impact on clinical outcomes would be undetectable. A previous meta-analysis by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration documented that oral antiplatelet drugs in secondary prevention decreased the risk of a subsequent myocardial infarction by 25% and mortality by 20% among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. However, even usage of such drugs also led to a residual rate of re-hospitalization among about 15% of patients with diagnosed ischemic heart disease. One possible reason for this high readmission rate might be that there is a genetic component in the inherited susceptibility to aspirin insensitivity. As the number of candidate gene association studies is rapidly growing, one practical way to unveil the genetic basis of aspirin insensitivity is to systematically pool available data to obtain robust, replicable findings.<SEP>In this study, we evaluated the association of four common polymorphisms from four logical candidate genes (COX-1, COX-2, ITGA2B, ITGA2) with aspirin insensitivity via a meta-analysis. Our overall findings demonstrated the contributory roles of COX-2 and ITGA2 genetic polymorphisms in susceptibility to aspirin insensitivity; however, after stratifying studies by ethnicity, the risk estimates were strongly reinforced in populations of Chinese origin, relative to that of Caucasian origin. One possible explanation for this divergence is genetic heterogeneity across races and ethnicities. For example, the average frequency of ITGA2 gene rs1126643-T allele was 40.77% in Caucasian patients with aspirin insensitivity, but was as exceedingly high as 58.58% in Chinese patients. It is not uncommon to encounter genetic heterogeneity in any disease identification strategy. This ethnicity-specific effect suggests that different genetic backgrounds may account for this discrepancy or that different populations may have different linkage disequilibrium patterns due to the evolutionary history. Usually, a locus is in close linkage with another nearby causal locus in one ethnic group but not in another. As a consequence, there is a need to construct a database of aspirin insensitivity-susceptibility genes or polymorphisms in each racial/ethnic group.<SEP>To further account for other potential sources of heterogeneity, we employed a multivariable meta-regression model by incorporating several study-level covariates besides subgroup analyses. Interestingly, differences in percentage of CAD between patients and controls set out to be a potential source of heterogeneity across studies for COX-2 gene rs20417, suggesting its regulatory role in cardiovascular system. Moreover, the averaged platelet numbers also explained a large part of heterogeneity for the relevance of ITGA2 gene rs1126643 to aspirin insensitivity, which further strengthened our overall findings. However, it should be emphasized that meta-regression, although enabling consideration of various covariates, does not have the methodological robustness of a properly designed study that is intended to test the effect of these covariates formally. On the other hand, because meta-regression analysis involved studies of limited sample size, it might be underpowered to detect a small or moderate effect. Although statistical biases could not be ruled out and an indication of heterogeneity was noted for some comparisons, there was no evidence of publication bias in this meta-analysis as reflected by Egger's test, indicating the robustness of our findings.<SEP>Interpretation of this study, however, should consider several limitations. First, although our statistical tests showed low probability of publication bias, potential selection bias cannot be excluded, because we only retrieved articles published in English or Chinese language. Second, although a set of subgroup analyses had been undertaken, significant heterogeneity still persisted in some subgroups, limiting the interpretation of pooled risk estimates. Moreover for some polymorphisms, given the relatively small sample sizes, especially in subgroups, more large, well-designed studies are warranted to quantify risk estimates reliably. Third, we only involved four polymorphisms from four candidate genes in biological susceptibility to aspirin insensitivity. It is likely that the potential susceptibility of these polymorphisms to aspirin insensitivity is diluted or masked by gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. Therefore, the jury must refrain from drawing a final conclusion until large, well-designed, prospective studies confirm or refute our findings.<SEP>Despite these limitations, our findings demonstrated that the COX-2 and ITGA2 genetic defects might increase the risk of having aspirin insensitivity, especially for aspirin semi-resistance and in Chinese populations. Our findings also leave open the question of divergent genetic profiles across ethnic groups. Nonetheless, this meta-analysis provides supporting evidence for further investigation on the pathophysiological mechanisms of COX-2 and ITGA2 genes in the development of aspirin insensitivity.",17134,['FOODAL']
33090292,"Introduction<SEP>Homozygous recessive mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT5B) in humans result in growth hormone insensitivity (GHI) and primary immunodeficiency. STAT5B deficiency (MIM 245590) presents as severe short stature, chronic eczema, autoimmunity, recurrent infections, and chronic pulmonary complications. STAT5B deficient patients experience frequent respiratory infections in infancy and typically develop lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) during childhood resulting in fatal respiratory insufficiency before the age of 30. As patients are typically diagnosed following the development of severe growth and immune impairments, the early diagnosis of STAT5B deficiency can provide valuable insights into how the loss of functional STAT5B drives immune dysfunction and disease development.<SEP>STAT5B is one of seven STAT family proteins, sharing 96% amino acid sequence homology with its closest family member, STAT5A. Collectively referred to as Stat5, Stat5a and Stat5b are activated downstream of signaling through type 1 cytokine receptors with ligands including growth hormone (GH), IL-2 family cytokines, IL-3 family cytokines, and prolactin. Following ligand binding, Janus kinase (JAK) proteins are recruited to the receptor and phosphorylate Stat5, resulting in its dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional regulation.<SEP>In mice, the high homology between Stat5a and Stat5b results in functional redundancy. Only male Stat5b knockout mice have growth impairments while both male and female mice demonstrate mild immune impairments. However, both male and female STAT5B deficient patients present with severe short stature and chronic immunodeficiency. When diagnosed clinically, STAT5B deficient patients present with moderate reductions in total CD3+ T cells, naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), and occasionally natural killer (NK) cells and TCRγδ T cells. These patients also display increased proportions of memory T cells along with B cell hyperactivity including increased immunoglobulin and autoantibody production. However, the evolution of immune dysregulation in STAT5B deficiency has not yet been assessed early in life.<SEP>We now report a novel homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) STAT5B mutation in three siblings initially presenting between ages 7 months to 5 years. The early identification of a pathological molecular defect by whole exome sequencing (WES) allowed for early diagnosis and longitudinal evaluation of each sibling. We tracked variations in adaptive immune cell subsets and disease development through infancy and early childhood. Our findings suggest important roles for STAT5B in the maintenance of T cell subsets including FOXP3+ Tregs and CD8+ memory T cells. Furthermore, sustained impairments in B cells and in the proportions of naïve versus memory T cells were identified, suggesting a role of STAT5B in immune tolerance and T cell homeostasis. Collectively, our analyses highlight the importance of STAT5B in the development and maintenance of adaptive immune cells.","Materials and Methods<SEP>Antibodies<SEP>Antibodies used were: anti-phospho-STAT5 and anti-alpha tubulin monoclonal horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO); following recommended dilutions. Secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG antibodies) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden) and fluorescently tagged antibodies for microscopy were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) and Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA).<SEP>Mutation Analysis<SEP>Whole exome sequencing of DNA from Patient 1, P1, was performed through Sengenics (Cambridge, England) on Illumina HiSeq 2500. Sanger sequencing confirmed the homozygous mutation in P1 and revealed heterozygosity in both parents. Dermal fibroblasts established from skin biopsies from each sibling were obtained with consent in compliance with ethics guidelines (institutional review board of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center), and DNA was extracted using PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For confirming the mutation, sanger sequencing of STAT5B exon 15 was performed using primers; (forward) 5’-ctctggtgttcttatgttcacttgttgtatct-3’ (reverse) 5’-tatttttcataggctgccttattatgagtatgtca-3’.<SEP>Serum Assays<SEP>Serum samples from the patients were obtained with consent and in compliance with the institutional review board of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. Serum GH, IGF-1, IGF-BP3, and IGF-ALS (acid labile subunit) were clinically measured using chemiluminescent immunoassay. Serum prolactin was measured using carbonylmetalloimmunoassay. The leukocyte count was determined through flow cytometry, fluorescence, and absorption spectrophotometry. The remaining immune profiles were obtained through flow cytometry. All laboratory tests were performed at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.<SEP>Generation of Recombinant Mutant<SEP>For reconstitution experiments, the STAT5B p.W631* was generated using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from New England BioLabs (#E0554S), with N-terminally FLAG-tagged STAT5B cDNA as template. The primers were: (forward) 5’-gcatcaccattgcttagaagtttgattctcagg-3’ and (reverse) 5’-cctgagaatcaaacttctaagcaatggtgatgc-3’. The mutated nucleotide is underlined, and mutant cDNA sequence was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.<SEP>Cell Culture<SEP>HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human growth hormone receptor (HEK-GHRs) provided by Dr. Richard J. Ross (University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.4% Geneticin at 37°C in 5% CO2. For in vitro functional analyses, HEK293-GHRs were transfected with either an empty pcDNA 3.1 vector, FLAG-tagged STAT5B WT (F-STAT5B WT), or FLAG-tagged STAT5B mutant (F-STAT5B p.W631*) using Polyjet transfection reagent (SignaGen Laboratories). Following a 24 hour transfection, cells were serum starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 16 hours and then treated with 100 ng/mL rhGH for 20 minutes. Transfection experiments were repeated three times.<SEP>Western Immunoblotting<SEP>Cells were solubilized in Sigma M2 Cell Lysis Buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), 150nM sodium chloride, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1% Triton-X100) supplemented with a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) and 100 mM sodium orthovanadate. Protein concentrates of the lysates were determined using the Bradford assay, and 25 μg protein was loaded onto a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (SDS-PAGE). The gel-fractionated proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked using 3% BSA in 1X Tris-buffered saline. Western blots were processed with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies following the manufacturers’ protocols, and scanned using the Odyssey IR Imaging System (LICOR Biosciences).<SEP>Immunocytochemistry<SEP>HEK-GHRs were plated at a density of 25,000 cells per well in 8-well chamber slides, transfected and treated as outlined above, and fixed with 100% methanol for 5 minutes at −20°C. After 4 hours of blocking in 5% donkey serum, the wells were incubated overnight in the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies according to the manufacturers’ protocols. Images were captured using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope with A1R confocal, GaAsp PMTs, and resonant scanner. Images were analyzed using the Imaris software and statistical analyses performed using GraphPad Prism. To calculate significant differences, the Holm-Sidak method was used with alpha=0.5.","Results<SEP>Clinical presentation of three siblings<SEP>Three siblings, born to consanguineous parents, were referred to the endocrine outpatient clinic at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City in Abu Dhabi for severe post-natal growth failure. The oldest sibling, patient 1 (P1), was conceived by in-vitro fertilization and born premature at 25 weeks but appropriate for gestational age (AGA) with a birth weight of 650-g and birth length of 30 cm. As a neonate, P1 was hospitalized for pneumonia with sepsis, requiring antibiotic treatments and supplemental oxygen. After discharge, she developed recurrent urinary tract and pulmonary infections, resulting in multiple hospitalizations that reduced in frequency with age and responded to antibiotics. She additionally had severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, feeding difficulties resulting in failure to thrive, and was developmentally delayed. P1 presented to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) at 4.8 years old with a GHI phenotype including severe short stature (height SDS −6.5), centripetal fat distribution, a prominent forehead, and a depressed nasal bridge. Atopic disease was present including eczema and reactive airway disease requiring corticosteroids. P1 was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and treated with levothyroxine. She additionally developed idiopathic thrombocytopenia at age 4 that resolved in months and recurred at age 7. She showed a temporarily positive treatment response to IVIG and dexamethasone, but platelet counts were normalized and sustained upon treatment with sirolimus. She did not develop ear, sinus, or skin infections or fungal infections. No lymphadenopathy was noted on physical exams.<SEP>Patient 2 (P2) was born AGA at 37 weeks, weighing 2040-g. At the time of presentation, he was 2 years old with severe short stature and height SDS of −5.06, displaying a GHI phenotype similar to P1. P2 developed recurrent infections of the skin, urinary tract, and lungs requiring antibiotics and often supplemental oxygen. He presented with general lymphadenopathy at the time of evaluation. Similar to P1, chronic eczema and reactive airway disease developed. At presentation, P2 was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and treated with levothyroxine.<SEP>Patient 3 (P3) presented at 7 months of age and was born AGA at 35 weeks, weighing 1900-g, but presented with severe short stature (height SDS −4.7) and facial dysmorphism. She had failure to thrive, and experienced recurrent skin and pulmonary infections requiring antibiotics and supplemental oxygen. P3 initially presented with atopic eczema and over the years of follow-up developed reactive airway disease. At age 2, she was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and treated with levothyroxine. P3 additionally had gastroesophageal reflux disease. No lymphadenopathy was noted.<SEP>Family history was negative for severe short stature that required medical attention, and both parents were of near-normal heights. When evaluated at CCHMC, the three siblings were placed on recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (rhIGF-1) to improve growth. The clinical presentation of these three siblings is outlined in Table 1.<SEP>Identification of novel homozygous nonsense STAT5B mutation in three siblings<SEP>At presentation, each sibling had normal serum GH levels and below-normal IGF-1, IGF-BP3, and acid labile subunit (ALS) concentrations, consistent with GHI. These abnormally low values and clinical phenotype prompted WES analysis of P1 at age 3.9. Trio clinical whole exome sequencing revealed 112,781 variants in P1, with only one candidate associated with growth and immune impairments, a homozygous variant in STAT5B, c.1892G>A, converting a tryptophan at position 631 to a nonsense residue, p.W631*. Other candidate variants can be found in Table S2. Sanger sequencing revealed heterozygosity in this STAT5B locus in both parents (Figure S1A), and sequencing of dermal fibroblast cultures from each sibling confirmed the presence of the mutation (Figure S1B). Interestingly, this novel mutation is adjacent to the first identified mutation in STAT5B, p.A630P (Figure S1C). The resulting protein lacks ~50% of the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, the critical phosphorylated tyrosine at position 699, and the entire transactivation domain (TAD).<SEP>Reconstitution analyses reveal impairments in the expression and function of the STAT5B p.W631* protein<SEP>The SH2 and TAD domains are critical for STAT5B activation, homodimer formation, and driving transcriptional activation. To evaluate the functional capacity of the STAT5B p.W631* mutation, we performed in vitro reconstitution analyses in HEK-GHRs. The truncated STAT5B p.W631* protein was significantly reduced in expression compared to wild-type FLAG-STAT5B (F-STAT5B WT) (Figure 1A and B). F-STAT5B WT, but not F-STAT5B p.W631*, was phosphorylated following GH treatment (Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence analyses revealed impaired nuclear localization of the F-STAT5B p.W631* protein following GH treatment (Figure 1C and D). Our results reveal reduced expression of the STAT5B p.W631* variant and an inability to be phosphorylated or traffic into the nucleus upon GH stimulation.<SEP>Sustained B cell hyperactivity is associated with atopy and autoimmunity in STAT5B deficient siblings<SEP>The identification of a LOF STAT5B variant in our patients prompted an evaluation of immune profiles. STAT5B deficient patients typically have reductions in the number of NK cells along with impaired function, and normal to elevated levels of B cells with increased immunoglobulin production. From infancy through early childhood, each sibling displayed normal numbers of NK cells (Table S1), B cells, and serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM (Table 2). Serum levels of IgE were consistently elevated in P1 and P2 (Table 2). These sustained elevations in IgE were associated with the development of chronic eczema and reactive airway disease, consistent with an atopic phenotype often associated with STAT5B deficiency. In early childhood, each sibling carried anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (Table 2).<SEP>STAT5B is important for the maintenance of T cell levels<SEP>While immune defects associated with LOF STAT5B mutations vary, 7 out of 9 STAT5B deficient patients evaluated were moderately to severely T cell lymphopenic at the time of diagnosis. It remains unknown whether the systemic T cell reduction in these patients is due to impaired thymic T cell production or peripheral destruction. Studies of Stat5b−/− mice revealed normal levels of thymocytes and reduced splenocytes, while Stat5a−/−b−/− mice showed significant reductions in both thymocytes and splenocytes. To evaluate thymic output of T cells in the absence of functional STAT5B, levels of recent thymic emigrants (RTE) were assessed by quantification of CD4+CD45+CD31+ T cells. At 7 months of age, P3 displayed reduced RTEs that normalized the following year (Table 3). At 2 years of age, P2 displayed a low-normal RTE level that normalized over the following years. P1, who was evaluated at 4 years old, had normal RTEs throughout the evaluation.<SEP>Annual immune analyses did not reveal any alterations in total T cell levels, with the absolute number and total percentage of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells remaining within normal ranges in all three siblings (Table 3). The CD4:CD8 ratio also remained normal as previously reported. The normal levels of peripheral T cells from infancy to early childhood in the three young siblings suggest that STAT5B is likely dispensable for T lymphocyte development in these siblings, but may be important for long-term maintenance of T cell levels as older STAT5B deficient patients typically manifest T cell lymphopenia.<SEP>STAT5B may be responsible for the maintenance, rather than generation, of regulatory T cells<SEP>Roles of STAT5B in IL-2 signaling include FOXP3 induction, Treg function, and self-tolerance in both humans and mice. Prior reports demonstrate reduced numbers and function of Tregs in STAT5B deficient patients; however, these evaluations were made when the patients were older and had already developed severe immune and pulmonary complications. In our younger patients, we annually evaluated the absolute numbers and total percentage of Tregs identified as CD4+ cells either expressing high levels of CD25 and low levels of CD127 (CD25+CD127low) or CD25 and FOXP3 (CD25+FOXP3+). Interestingly, the absolute number and total percentage of FOXP3+ Tregs were normal in P2 and P3 between the ages of 7 months and 5 years (Figure 2A–B, Figure S2). Reductions in Tregs were not consistently identified in P1 until age 8 (Figure 2A–C). However, the total percentage of CD4+CD25+CD127low T cells was reduced by the age of 3 years in each sibling (Figure 2D). These data suggest that the LOF STAT5B variant in these siblings impairs the maintenance of FOXP3 expression over time rather than the initial generation of FOXP3+ Tregs.<SEP>Pronounced dysregulation of memory CD8+ T cells in young STAT5B deficient siblings<SEP>When evaluated, STAT5B deficient patients often have reduced naïve T cells and elevations in T cells with a memory/activation phenotype. Each of our siblings had modest but persistently reduced proportions of both CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T cells and elevated proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells (Figure S3, Figure S4A and B, Figure 3A and B). Evaluation of CD4+ T cell activation markers including CD69+, CD71+, CD40L+, CD134+, HLA+, and CD95+, were unremarkable (Table S1). The impact of STAT5B on memory T cell subsets including CD45RO+CCR7+ central memory (TCM), CD45RO+CCR7− effector memory (TEM), and CD45RA+CCR7− effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) were also evaluated in each sibling. CD4+ and CD8+ TCM cells remained within normal ranges (Figure S4C, Figure 3C). No alterations in the proportion CD4+ TEM cells were identified (Figure S4D), but increases in CD8+ TEM cell proportions became clinically significant with age in each sibling (Figure 3D). Elevations in the percentage of CD8+ TEMRA cells detected during infancy in P2 and P3 normalized around age 4 and remained normal in P1 (Figure 3E). A dysregulation of CD8+ T cells was noted despite normal CD4+ memory T cell subsets, an observation not previously reported for STAT5B deficiency. Our patients carried elevated proportions of CD8+ memory T cells beginning in infancy, suggesting a critical role for this LOF STAT5B variant in CD8+ T cell activation and homeostasis.","Discussion<SEP>Homozygous mutations in STAT5B occur rarely in humans and are typically diagnosed in the teenage years following the development of prominent growth and immune impairments. The late diagnosis of this condition, together with a discordance of phenotypic similarities between Stat5−/− mice, have limited our understanding of the role of STAT5B in the development of adaptive immune dysfunction in humans. The four-year evaluation of three STAT5B deficient siblings, from ages 7 months to 8 years, permitted the generation of a potential timeline of immune dysregulation and disease development associated with STAT5B deficiency (Figure 4).<SEP>At presentation, our STAT5B deficient siblings exhibited severe short stature, atopic eczema, autoimmune thyroiditis, and chronic infections. The pneumonias often required supplemental oxygen, but hospitalizations due to pulmonary complications decreased with age. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, the fatal sequelae of STAT5B deficiency, has not yet presented in these siblings. Sequencing identified a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the SH2 domain of STAT5B, STAT5B p.W631*, resulting in a truncated STAT5B variant with reduced expression and an inability to be phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus upon stimulation.<SEP>As these siblings were genetically diagnosed with STAT5B deficiency at an early age and had not yet developed severe lung complications, we had the unique opportunity to evaluate developmental patterns of adaptive immune cells due to a lack of functional STAT5B. The young age and severe short stature of these patients prevented the collection of samples for mechanistic analyses. However, novel insights were gained from focused clinical adaptive immune evaluations. While normal levels of B cells were noted, we identified elevated IgE production and autoantibody production associated with atopy and autoimmunity in the first year of life. At their young ages, no T cell lymphopenia was noted, and a reduction in FOXP3+ Tregs was not identified until age 8 in P1. While a reduction in the proportion of naïve T cells and elevation in the proportion of memory T cells was sustained through the years of analysis, CD8+ T cells had more pronounced impairments with an increase in CD8+ TEM cells and a reduction of CD8+ TEMRA cells with age. Our annual evaluations of three young siblings carrying a LOF STAT5B variant highlight the importance of STAT5B in post-natal immune development and function.<SEP>Loss of immune regulation was evident in infancy in all three siblings resulting in sustained IgE overproduction and autoantibody production. These effects were associated with the development of atopy and autoimmunity during infancy, suggesting a role for STAT5B in immune tolerance. Mouse studies have determined a critical role for the loss of Stat5 in T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation, along with increased germinal center B cells and autoantibody production. Future evaluations of Tfh cells may help to reveal a mechanistic role for B cell hyperactivity associated with STAT5B deficiency as evidenced from other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis.<SEP>Moderate to severe T cell lymphopenia is often associated with STAT5B deficiency. We show that T cell lymphopenia may likely be developmental result of a loss of STAT5B in our young siblings. From 7 months to 8 years of age, all three siblings had normal levels of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells. It is possible that the truncated variant of STAT5B p.W631* retains some functional capacity, allowing for normal T cell levels. However, as this variant lacks critical functional domains and demonstrated impaired activation and nuclear translocation in response to stimulation, it is less likely that this truncated variant remains functional. Our clinical evaluations suggest an involvement of STAT5B in the maintenance of CD3+ T cells rather than their generation. As Stat5 in mice is known to induce expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, the evaluation of apoptotic markers in T cells derived from STAT5B deficient patients may be insightful.<SEP>Tregs have been extensively characterized in STAT5B deficient patients including reports of reductions in thymic and induced Tregs and identifying the binding sites of STAT5B on the FOXP3 promoter region. Signaling through STAT5B induces expression of CD25 and FOXP3, but whether this is essential from birth remained unknown. Our observations suggest a potential role for STAT5B in the maintenance of regulatory T cells in our three siblings, as no reductions in FOXP3+ Tregs were observed until later in childhood. Mechanisms other than STAT5B signaling that regulate FOXP3 expression and regulatory T cell function including TGF-β and retinoic acid signaling, may be sufficient at early ages to generate and maintain Tregs. We show for the first time that a LOF mutation in STAT5B can result in impaired human Treg homeostasis with age.<SEP>When evaluated, older STAT5B deficient patients carry elevated CD4+CD45RO+ and CD8+CD45RO+ memory T cells and reduced CD4+CD45RA+ and CD8+CD45RA+ naïve T cells. This was similarly observed in our younger patients; however, CD4+ memory T cell subsets remained within normal ranges. As the first evaluation of these cell types in STAT5B deficiency, CD8+ TEM and TEMRA cells in our patients changed significantly over time. As CD8+ TEM levels increased above the normal range, CD8+ TEMRA cells decreased to within normal range. While most functional assays on patient-derived STAT5B deficient T cells have been performed on CD4+ T cells, mouse studies have identified significant differences in CD8+ T cells with alterations in Stat5 expression. Although signaling through IL-7 and IL-15 is known to be involved in murine memory T cell development, the specific signaling components involved in human memory T cell development remain unknown. Similarly, the mechanisms governing human TCM versus TEM development remain elusive. Our analyses suggest that STAT5B plays a critical role in the generation or survival of memory T cells including CD8+ TEM cells in our siblings, although the specific mechanisms involved still need to be determined. As a downstream transcription factor involved in IL-7 and IL-15 signaling, STAT5B activation may be important for the regulation of homeostatic proliferation and survival of CD8+ memory T cells. Interestingly, mouse studies have concluded that Stat5 activation is sufficient for CD8+ memory T cell survival, while the loss of STAT5B in humans may support memory T cell survival.<SEP>With the lack of innate immune impairments in our young patients, we focused on evaluating adaptive immune cell subsets. Mechanistic assessments of these progressive changes were unable to be performed due to insufficient samples collected, given the size and young age of these patients. Nevertheless, our results are the first to suggest a critical role for STAT5B in T cell development from infancy to early childhood, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and evaluations of patients presenting with developmental delay, postnatal growth impairments, eczema, chronic infections, and autoimmunity. As LIP has not yet developed in these young siblings, along with T cell lymphopenia and significantly reduced regulatory T cell levels, we will continue to closely monitor these markers and their potential involvement in STAT5B-associated lung disease development. Total and regulatory T cell values should be carefully evaluated following the diagnosis of STAT5B deficiency, along with symptoms of pulmonary disease.",26156,['FOODAL']

Asparaginase (ASP), responsible for the asparagine depletion of the extracellular fluid compartment, is a key components of the therapy. However, unpredictable immunological reactions to this enzyme with bacterial origin are major challenges in clinical practice. ASP hypersensitivity may manifest even as an anaphylactic reaction that can be life‐threatening. Besides, the allergic reaction is associated with the development of anti‐ASP antibodies, which may have long‐term adverse consequences. These antibodies can neutralise ASP, resulting in a suboptimal treatment response through reduced drug exposure and subsequent recurrence of the disease. 1 ,  2  <SEP>According to the current ALL IC‐BFM 2009 treatment protocol in Hungary, paediatric patients with ALL receive Escherichia coli‐derived ASP as a first‐line treatment. While in higher‐income countries the less immunogenic, but more expensive PEGylated (PEG) ASP preparation is the first‐line drug, the cheaper E. coli ASP is the first choice in lower‐income countries. The most common reason for the discontinuation of ASP therapy is hypersensitivity, with an incidence rate of up to 45% for native E. coli ASP. However, hypersensitivity is less likely to develop (in 3 to 24% of patients) against the PEGylated form of the drug. 3  <SEP>First, Fernandez et al. published that the HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele predisposes to E. coli ASP hypersensitivity in paediatric ALL patients. 4  Later, in a subsequent genome‐wide association study by the same group, a single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linked to HLA‐DRB1*07:01 also acted as a risk allele for ASP hypersensitivity in patients of diverse ancestry. 5  In 2017, we published our results confirming the role of the DRB1*07:01 allele in the development of ASP hypersensitivity in Hungarian patients using a next‐generation sequencing method; and we also showed with bioinformatics tools that this association was restricted to the extended HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype. 6  The HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele only increased the risk of hypersensitivity if it occurred in a haplotype with HLA‐DQB1*02:02, while the HLA‐DRB1*07:01–HLA‐DQB1*03:03 haplotype were not associated with an increased risk. The HLA‐DQA1*02:01 allele was in complete linkage disequilibrium with the HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele. 6  Recently, the implication of HLA‐DRB1*07:01, DQA1*02:01 and DQB1*02:02 alleles in ASP hypersensitivity was confirmed by Gagné et al. 7  <SEP>Current diagnostic HLA genotyping methods are time‐consuming and expensive, requiring specially equipped laboratories. In addition, the cost and time required for these laboratory‐based tests are further increased implicitly by sample collection, transport and reporting, limiting the utility of HLA genotyping in precision medicine. 8  Alternative testing methods have been explored to overcome these barriers and enable the application of HLA testing at the point of care. One of these possible methods is to determine tagging SNPs. 9  <SEP>The HLA‐DRB1*07:01 is one of the pharmacogenomic biomarkers in drug labelling approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. 10  In a recent work of Erlichster et al. previously described tagging SNPs were re‐evaluated, and a novel rs28383172 was identified as a potential cross‐ethnicity tagging SNP for HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele using bioinformatics analyses on the 1000 Genomes dataset. 8  Previously, Monsuur et al. identified 6 tagging SNPs to predict risk‐conferring HLA variants, including 3 SNPs for DQA1*0201/DQB1*0202 (DQ2.2) haplotype in coeliac disease. 11  Later, Koskinen et al. validated their method in Finnish, Hungarian and Italian populations. 12  <SEP>Based on these, we selected a total of 4 tagging SNPs: rs28383172, rs2395182, rs4713586 and rs7775228 (Table 1) for capturing the HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype. Our results revealed that the most efficient haplotype tagging could be achieved by using 2 SNP tags. In addition, we evaluated the clinical performance of this screening method for E. coli ASP hypersensitivity in a retrospective manner.","METHODS<SEP>In a previous study ALL patients with known ASP hypersensitivity status (n = 359) were typed at high‐resolution level for HLA‐DRB1 (exon 2) and HLA‐DQB1 (exons 2 and 3), in the Beijing Genomics Institute using an NGS‐based genotyping method that applies a massively parallel paired‐end sequencing on Illumina MiSeq, effective variant phasing and haploid sequence assembling pipeline. 6  According to the results we found that the HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype was associated with E. coli ASP hypersensitivity, and suggested it as a possible screening marker for this phenomenon. A case was regarded as having E. coli ASP hypersensitivity when signs of allergic reactions or anaphylactic reactions National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 1 and above were noted, as described in detail earlier. In this cohort of patients, the overall E. coli ASP hypersensitivity rate was 39%. 6 ,  13  A subset of patients from the original study (n = 241) with known HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype and available DNA samples was chosen as reference population for evaluating the SNP tagging method. Characteristics of the patients in the original cohort and in the successfully SNP‐genotyped subpopulation (n = 233) are presented in Table 2.<SEP>Written informed consent was obtained from the study participants or from the next of kin, caretakers or guardians on the behalf of the minors/children participants involved in the study. The study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Hungarian Scientific and Research Ethics Committee of the Medical Research Council (ETT TUKEB; Case No.:8–374/2009‐1018EKU 914/PI/08).<SEP>The rs28383172 was determined using a Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay (4331349, ANNKYYJ; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Since we did not have any sample from a patient homozygous for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype, a DNA sample obtained from the MOU human cell line (88052050, IHW Number: 9050; Human Leukocyte Antigen Typed Collection maintained by the European Collection of Cell Cultures) representing HLA‐DRB1*0701, HLA‐DQA1*0201 and HLA‐DQB1*0202 in homozygous form was used as a positive control. The rs2395182, rs4713586 and rs7775228 were determined using KASPar‐on‐Demand prevalidated assays (Aliquot IDs: 0303639501, 0303736579 and 0303639507, respectively; LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany). In all cases, genotyping was carried out using 7900HT Fast Real‐Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).<SEP>Statistical analyses of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and Cohen‐κ values were performed using VassarStats (http://vassarstats.net/). 14  Venn diagrams were created by using Displayr online software (https://www.displayr.com/). To compare sensitivities, specificities and predictive values of the screening tests, McNemar χ2 test and the method of Moskowitz and Pepe were applied using R statistical software (3.6.3) and the DTComPair package. 15 ,  16 ,  17  The performance of the different combinations of the reported SNPs for tagging HLA‐DRB1*07:01‐DQB1*02:02 haplotype was assessed separately for each of the 1000 Genomes super populations (AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR and SAS). Haplotype estimation was performed using the PHASE software (v.2.1.1) based on the reported HLA allele data. 18  ","RESULTS<SEP>In the present study we utilized results from a previous investigation, namely, the sequencing‐based genotyping results of exon 2 in the HLA‐DRB1 and exons 2 and 3 in the HLA‐DQB1 genes of 359 ALL children with known ASP hypersensitivity status. 6  As a follow‐up cohort, a subset of these patients (n = 241) was enrolled. They were chosen based on the availability of their DNA samples. In the follow‐up cohort, we performed the genotyping of the 4 selected SNPs (Table 1) and investigated their potentials as predictors for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 carrier status (SNP‐genotyped subpopulation). Using the Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay the success rate of rs28383172 genotyping was 98%. Two patients had to be excluded due to the poor quality of their DNA samples; therefore, out of 241, a total of 233 patients were finally included in the analysis (Table 2). From the genotyping using KASPar‐on‐Demand prevalidated assays, genotypes were available for all 3 SNPs (rs2395182, rs4713586 and rs7775228) in all 233 patients. Based on the genotyping results, linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficients were calculated between the 4 SNPs in our population and based on the 1000 Genomes dataset in several super populations. As can be seen in Figures S1 and S2 there was LD between the investigated SNPs in all populations and the LD coefficients in the Hungarian population were most similar to those of in the EUR super population.<SEP>Based on the literature, the genotypes determined for each SNP were classified as positive and negative predictors of HLA type separately (Supporting Information Table S1). We then evaluated the results as follows: (i) the association of rs28383172 AG or GG genotypes and HLA‐DRB1*07:01 carrier status; (ii) the association of rs28383172 AG or GG genotypes and HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status; (iii) the association of rs2395182 TT or TG and rs4713586 TT and rs7775228 TC or CC genotypes and HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status; (iv) patients meeting both the second and the third conditions were checked for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status; and (v) patients with rs28383172 AG or GG and rs7775228 TC or CC genotypes were examined for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status (Supporting Information Table S2). The fifth algorithm was raised as a possible approach in data evaluation, during which we examined the contribution of each SNP in different combinations to positive prediction (Figure 1).<SEP>The performance of each test can be seen in Table 3. Carrying the G allele of rs28383172 was in perfect concordance with the HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele carrier status. Two‐thirds of the patients harbouring HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele were HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carriers. The rest of the patients did not carry the HLA‐DQB1*02:02 allele. Thus, algorithms II–V were designed to identify the same group of patients. The last of these, i.e. the 2‐SNP approach, seems to be the most suitable for clinical utilization with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values all greater than 95%.<SEP>To confirm our results in other populations, the performance of the different combinations of the tag SNPs was also assessed in the 1000 Genomes dataset. The results obtained for algorithm I were the same as those described by Erlichster et al. 8  For algorithm V, we found 100% sensitivity and >95% specificity in 3 out of 5 super populations, in AMR, EAS and EUR (Figure S3). The SNP combinations used for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype‐tagging in algorithms III and IV did not achieve the performance required for validation in any super population.<SEP>We performed a pairwise comparison of the performance of algorithms II‐V on both the Hungarian and the 1000 Genomes data. In the Hungarian SNP‐genotyped subpopulation, specificity and the positive predictive value of algorithms III, IV and V were significantly higher compared to algorithm II, and, similarly, the specificity and the positive predictive value of algorithm IV were significantly higher compared to algorithm III, while the results of further comparisons were not found to be significant (Supporting Information Table S3). However, in the EUR super population, sensitivity and the negative predictive value of algorithm V, i.e. the 2‐SNP tagging, were significantly higher compared to algorithms III and IV. Besides, specificity and the positive predictive value of algorithm V were significantly higher compared to algorithm II. Overall, in the different comparisons on the 1000 Genomes dataset, the values of the different parameters of algorithm V were, in almost all cases, better than the values of algorithms II, III and IV (Figure S3).<SEP>In the SNP‐genotyped subpopulation, we evaluated the performance of the HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 and its surrogate markers as screening tests for E. coli ASP hypersensitivity (Table 4). The test identified a small proportion of affected patients (sensitivity value of 23.4%), but with good specificity (88.5%) and its positive and negative predictive values were 57.9 and 63.1%, respectively. We note that the performance measures of the HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype and of its best tagger algorithm (V) were identical meanwhile, the latter is not a perfect predictor for the haplotype (i.e. the sensitivity and specificity of algorithm V to tag the haplotype were <100%). The reason for this seemingly contradictory result is that there were 2 patients for whom the tagger algorithm V missed the true haplotype carrier status (one in both directions), but neither had E. coli ASP hypersensitivity, and therefore they did not change the proportion of allergic patients.","DISCUSSION<SEP>The aim of the present study was to investigate 4 SNPs as possible tags for the HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype found to be associated previously with ASP hypersensitivity and to provide experimental evidence for their possible clinical application. For patients with increased risk, the less immunogenic (but more expensive) PEG ASP could be administered as a first‐line treatment instead of E. coli ASP. PEG ASP does not carry unnecessary additional risks, rather just benefits for the patients. Compared to the rest of the population, patients with hypersensitivity‐prone genotype would benefit more from the administration of PEG ASP before the hypersensitivity evolves. The lower the proportion of false negative cases is (i.e. the higher the negative predictive value), the higher patient safety is. However, from a cost‐effectiveness point of view, the specificity of the test should be high so that the additional cost of treatment modification is kept to a minimum with maximum efficacy. The genotype‐based drug choice would require very little extra cost compared to a strategy with PEG ASP therapy as frontline treatment for all. It must be added that although the PEG ASP therapy is associated with significantly lower prevalence of hypersensitivity, within the PEG ASP treated group, the HLA.DRB1*07:01 allele was also shown to be associated with increased risk of hypersensitivity. 4  <SEP>We identified 2 SNPs, rs28383172 and rs7775228, as most suitable tags for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype in 233 Hungarian patients with paediatric ALL. The role of rs28383172 as a cross‐ethnicity tagging SNP for HLA‐DRB1*07:01 was predicted previously by Erlichster et al. based on analyses on the 1000 Genomes dataset. 8  In other studies, rs28724121 and rs17885382 SNPs were also used to tag HLA DRB1*07:01 allele. 5 ,  7  Our measurements in the follow‐up cohort with known HLA‐DRB1 genotypes revealed complete concordance between rs28383172 and HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele. Thus, we confirmed that rs28383172 is an ideal and sufficient surrogate marker for HLA‐DRB1*07:01 carrier status. The chosen custom TaqMan genotyping method is considered the gold standard for genotyping with fluorescence‐based homogenous assays. Functionally tested TaqMan genotyping assay for rs7775228 is also available.<SEP>Rs7775228 is one of the previously identified tagging SNPs for DQ2.2 haplotype. 11 ,  12  This SNP has been found to be predictive for the haplotype in several European populations, but its applicability in a non‐European population has not yet been elucidated. In combination with rs28383172, we verified their applicability as HLA‐DRB1*07:01‐DQB1*02:02 haplotype tags in AMR, EAS and EUR super populations using bioinformatics analyses on the 1000 Genomes dataset. Haplotype phasing could not be performed for 3 loci in the absence of HLA‐DQA1 data; however, considering the global frequency of HLA‐DQA1 alleles associated with the HLA‐DRB1*07:01‐DQB1*02:02 haplotype, HLA‐DQA1*02:01 is found in this haplotype block in approximately 95% of the cases. Based on these, we concluded that the combination of rs7775228 and rs28383172 was widely suitable for tagging DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status.<SEP>The role of HLA‐DRB1*07:01 has been described in connection to drugs other than ASP. HLA‐DRB1*07:01, as a part of the DRB1*07:01‐DQA1*02:01 haplotype, is one of the Food and Drug Administration‐annotated pharmacogenomic biomarkers based on its association with lapatinib‐induced hepatotoxicity. 19  The same haplotype was also implicated in thiopurine‐induced pancreatitis among patients with inflammatory bowel disease. 20  Earlier, at lower resolution, the DRB1*07‐DQA1*02 haplotype has been described as being associated with drug‐induced liver‐injury resulting from anticoagulant ximelagatran. 21  <SEP>The limitations of this study are its retrospective design and the lack of ASP activity monitoring of the cohort. Because of the latter, a small proportion of patients categorized as hypersensitive may have only had non‐immunological infusion reactions. 22 ,  23  We do not think, however, that this issue would substantially undermine our results. The evidence for the association of HLA‐genotype and ASP hypersensitivity is robust, similarly described by 3 separate research groups. If cases of infusion reactions could be taken away, we would expect that the predictive value of genotypes may be even better.<SEP>In conclusion, we confirmed the previous findings experimentally that rs28383172 is an efficient tagging SNP for HLA‐DRB1*07:01. In addition, we demonstrated that in combination with rs7775228 these 2 SNPs are suitable for identifying HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status, proposing a clinical use algorithm for ASP hypersensitivity screening. A genotype‐based drug choice would require very little extra cost compared to a strategy with PEG ASP therapy as frontline treatment for all. To confirm our hypothesis, prospective clinical studies are required.",19151,['FOODAL']
32565728,"1. Introduction<SEP>In India, HIV remains to be one of the major issues (WHO, HIV/AIDS Fact sheet November 2017). The difference in susceptibility to the acquisition of HIV and disease progression is associated with a genetic background. Innate immunity is known to play a crucial role in response to viral pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that play a pivotal role in the innate immune system and control inflammatory responses and adaptive immunity. PRRs recognize evolutionarily conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and PAMP recognition triggers activation of signal transduction pathways and downstream effector responses. TLR families like TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 are localized on the cell surface and TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are localized in endosomal membranes inside the cell.<SEP> TLR7 plays an important role in an antiviral immune response. TLR7 recognizes RNA of various viruses including HIV. TLR7 bind single-stranded RNA. It shares a high degree of structural similarity, and their activation leads to nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines. The TLR7 gene span 16 kb apart, located on the Xp22.2 chromosome. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR genes may contribute to differences in the acquisition of HIV-1 and disease progression. Some of the studies reported that the functional polymorphism of TLR7 rs179008, Gln11Leu was associated with HIV acquisition, higher viral loads and accelerated progression to advanced immune suppression in HIV patients, hepatitis C infection, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), female HCV patients, and spontaneous clearance of HCV. Elefanti et al., have been reported that TLR7 32A/T polymorphism was not associated with melanoma cases. Similarly, TLR7 rs179009, IVS2-151A/G polymorphism was associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV in female patients and chronic hepatitis C. Wang et al., reported the frequency of IVS2-151A allele (77%) was higher as compared to IVS2-151G (22%). TLR7 32A/T polymorphism was associated with HIV-1 disease progression in HIV-1-infected women compared to uninfected women. TLR7 rs5743737 and TLR7 rs1634323 polymorphisms were associated with a decreased risk of BV while TLR7 rs179012 was associated with an increased risk.<SEP>Till now, none of the studies reported the association of TLR7 polymorphisms (rs179008 and rs179009) with the HIV infection and disease progression from India. Hence, we attempted to assess the distribution of TLR7 polymorphisms (rs179008 and rs179009) in HIV-infected individuals naïve to ART from the Western Indian population.","2. Materials and Methods<SEP>2.1. Subjects<SEP>The subject recruitment period was April 2014 to March 2017; 153 HIV-infected individuals naive to ART, aged between 18 and 50 years, were consecutively taken from the outdoor patient clinics of the National AIDS Research Institute, Pune. At the same time, 158 individuals free of (individuals from the same family excluded) HIV, hepatitis B and C, and tuberculosis were age-matched and serum negative from ELISA tests were recruited from the clinic belonging to the same institution. Clinical data was collected via a questionnaire, personal interviews, and review of case records. The estimation of CD4 count was done by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). CD4+ count < 350 cells/mm3, 350-500 cells/mm3, and >500 cells/mm3 were considered as advanced, intermediate, and early stage of HIV infection. ELISA for hepatitis C and HBsAg testing was performed using the Ortho HCV ELISA test system and Murex HBsAg confirmatory (DiaSorin) ELISA. Environmental exposures (tobacco and alcohol consumption) were also recorded in the questionnaire. The study was approved by local ethics committees of the institute, and all participants gave informed signed consent. Two ml of the peripheral blood sample was collected and stored at -700°C before DNA extraction. Genomic DNA extraction was done from peripheral blood leukocyte pellet using the AxyPrep Blood Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit according to the protocol given by the manufacturer.<SEP>2.2. Genotyping<SEP>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs179008 and rs179009) of the TLR7 gene were genotyped in subjects using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).<SEP>The primer for the amplification of TLR7 polymorphisms was used as reported by. The primer sequence of TLR7 rs179008 and rs179009 polymorphisms was F: 5′-TAACAACGAATAGG AAAATGC-3′ and R: 5′-GTTTTAGGAAACCATCTAGCC-3′. A total volume of 25 μl with 20 pmol of each primer, genomic DNA (100-150 ng), 10 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, PCR buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 1.5 units of Taq polymerase (Bangalore Genei, India) was used for PCR. The reaction conditions for TLR7 polymorphisms (rs179008) were initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 35 sec, annealing at 54°C for 30 sec, extension at 72°C for 1 min, and final extension at 72°C for 5 min. Amplified products of rs179008 and rs179009 polymorphisms were digested using restriction enzyme ApoI and NlaIII (MBI Fermentas Inc., USA), respectively. Genotyping of TLR7 polymorphisms was done in 15% polyacrylamide gel using molecular weight markers and visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. Based on sequences and location of SNP, TLR7 polymorphism rs179008 A/T was genotyped as assigned as follows: 166 bp + 37 bp + 66 bp for AA, 203 bp + 166 bp + 37 bp + 66 bp for AT, and 203 bp + 66 bp for TT. TLR7 rs179009 A/G was genotype as 122 bp + 247 bp for AA, 122 bp + 247 bp + 369 bp for AG, and 369 bp for GG. Veriti 96 well thermal cycler was used for amplification of reactions (Applied Biosystems, USA). PCR products and molecular weight markers were visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. Twenty percent of samples from both patients and controls were regenotyped by other laboratory personnel, and no discrepancy in genotyping was noticed. Sequencing was done in 10% of samples to assess the genotyping error.<SEP>2.3. Data Analysis<SEP>The age variable was expressed as a mean ± standard deviation (SD). The χ2 goodness-of -fit test was used for any deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls. We used the χ2 statistic (Fisher's exact test for cell size < 5) to compare genotype frequency between HIV-infected individuals vs. healthy controls. SNPStats software was used to compare haplotype frequency between HIV-infected individuals and controls. Interaction of tobacco use, alcohol intake, and genotypes was examined in all eligible HIV-infected individuals. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by unconditional binary logistic regression. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), and tests of statistical significance were two-sided and taken as significant when P value was less than 0.05.","3. Results<SEP>In the present study, we enrolled 150 HIV-infected individuals and 158 healthy controls. The mean age (years ± SD) of HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls were 36 yrs ± 3.2 and 33 yrs ± 6.47, respectively. The demographic profile of HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls is shown in Table 1.<SEP>3.1. Genotype-Phenotype Association<SEP>3.1.1. TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) Polymorphism and HIV-Infected Individuals<SEP>The occurrence of TLR7 polymorphism in HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls is shown in Table 2. Polymorphisms rs179008 and rs179009 in TLR7 gene followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.07, 0.05) in healthy controls. The distribution of rs179009 AG genotype in the codominant model, rs179009 AG-GG genotype in the dominant model, and rs179009 AG genotype in the overdominant model was significantly reduced in HIV-infected individuals as compared to healthy controls (18.0% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23-0.77, P = 0.016; 26.7% vs. 36.7%, OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.30-0.89, P = 0.016, and 18% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23-0.77, P = 0.0039).<SEP>3.1.2. TLR7 Haplotypes in HIV-Infected Individuals<SEP>The distribution of TLR7 haplotypes (rs179008 and rs179009) in HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls is shown in Table 3. In both polymorphisms, a nonsignificant association was observed in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D′) between HIV-infected individuals vs. healthy controls (D′: 0.2663). Haplotype AG (rs179008∗A/rs179009∗G) was found to be higher in HIV-infected individuals as compared to healthy controls (7.00% vs. 5.41%, OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.64-2.84, P = 0.43). Haplotypes AA, TA, and TG (rs179008∗A,∗T,∗T/rs179009∗A,∗A,∗G) were expressed almost similarly (75.33% vs. 72.44%, 14.33% vs. 16.8%, and 3.33% vs. 5.35%) (Table 3).<SEP>3.1.3. TLR7 Polymorphism and HIV Disease Stages<SEP>The prevalence of TLR7 rs179009 AG genotype was observed less in early, intermediate, and advanced HIV disease stage individuals as compared to healthy controls (5.0% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.52, P = 0.001; 5.7% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.11-0.96, P = 0.04; and 4.7% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.03-0.39, P ≤ 0.001). Frequency of TLR7 rs179009 GG genotype was reduced in advanced HIV disease stage as compared with healthy controls (1.6% vs. 7.6%, OR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.01-1.07, P = 0.03) (Table 4).<SEP>3.2. Gene-Environment Interaction<SEP>3.2.1. TLR7 Polymorphism and Environmental Factors<SEP>Consumption of tobacco and alcohol in HIV-infected individuals was analyzed for TLR7 polymorphism (Table 5). TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) polymorphisms did not differ between HIV-infected individuals with and without tobacco and alcohol users. The distribution of TLR7 rs179009AG genotype was found to be higher in tobacco-consuming HIV-infected individuals as compared to nonusers (26.1% vs. 17.2%, OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 0.52-5.49, P = 0.47). The prevalence of TLR7 rs179008 CC, CT, and TT genotypes was almost corresponding between tobacco-consuming HIV-infected individuals and nonconsuming (82.6% vs. 82.8%, 13.0% vs. 13.9%, and 4.3% vs. 3.3%). TLR7 rs179008 AA, AT, and TT and rs179009 AA, AG and GG genotypes distributed almost alike between alcohol taking HIV-infected individuals and nonusers (87.0% vs. 81.9%, 13.0% vs.14.2%, and 0.0% vs.3.9% and 78.3% vs. 72.4%, 17.4% vs. 18.1%, and 4.3% vs. 9.4%).<SEP>3.2.2. Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis<SEP>Correlation of age, sex, tobacco, alcohol, baseline CD4 counts, and TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) polymorphisms with HIV disease progression was done by multivariate logistic regression analysis. TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) polymorphisms, age, sex, tobacco, alcohol usage, and baseline CD4 counts were not found as an independent risk factor for HIV disease progression (table not shown).","4. Discussion<SEP>From India, this is a first of its kind study that examined the likely effects of TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) polymorphisms on susceptibility to the acquisition of HIV-1 and disease progression. The genetic background of human populations can influence the susceptibility and outcome of infectious diseases. Reports suggested that the variations within the host's genome play a role in acquiring HIV infection and disease progression. TLR gene variants and downstream signaling molecules could influence the ability of the affected individual to respond to TLR ligands resulting in altered susceptibility to or course of infectious disease. TLR7 polymorphism plays a role in HIV disease progression and viral load.<SEP>In our study, the prevalence of TLR7 rs179008 AA, AT, and TT genotypes in healthy controls was 81.0%, 16.5%, and 2.5%. This finding was unmatched with that of the other studies carried out by. The occurrence of TLR7 rs179008A/T allelic frequency was comparable with the study carried out by Valverde-Villegas et al., 2017, and dissimilar with the study reported by. The occurrence of TLR7 rs179009 polymorphism was matched with studies published by Wang et al., and unmatched with studies published by. We had observed a nonsignificant distribution of TLR7 rs179008 polymorphism between HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls, although TLR7 rs179008AT genotype was much more prevalent in HIV-infected individuals as compared to healthy controls (3.3% vs. 2.5%, OR = 1.54). While as an association was seen between TLR7 rs179009AG genotype and acquisition of HIV-1 (OR = 0.42, P = 0.016), TLR7rs179008A/T polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to asthma, course of hepatitis C infection, HIV-1 acquisition, and disease progression. TLR7 rs179008 polymorphism was not associated with patients of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), melanoma cases (P = 0.245), and between single melanoma and MPM cases (P = 0.482). TLR7 IVS2-151G/A allele was associated with the protection of female patients of chronic hepatitis C (P ≤ 0.001, OR =0.46). The finding of our study is supported by Wei et al.,. TLR7 IVS2-151GG genotype and IVS2-151G allele were associated with female HCV patients (P = 0.03 and ≤0.001). TLR7 rs179008 (Gln11Leu) and rs179009 (IVS2-151A/G) polymorphisms were associated with the spontaneous clearance of HCV.<SEP>We also analyzed the haplotype to evaluate the synergistic role of two SNPs (rs179008 and rs179009) in the TLR7 gene cluster. The occurrence of TLR7 haplotype AG (rs179008∗A/rs179009∗G) had increased in HIV-infected individuals as compared with healthy controls (7.00% vs. 5.41%, OR = 1.35).<SEP>We undertake a case-control study, CD4+ cell count used as a surrogate marker for HIV-1 infection. The timing for the acquisition of HIV-1 was unknown; hence, the effects may have had confounding consequences. Here, we analyzed the association of TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) polymorphisms with HIV disease stages to reveal the impact of TLR7 genotypes in the risk of HIV disease advancement. TLR7 rs179009AG genotype was associated with the early HIV disease stage individuals as compared with healthy controls (OR = 0.11, P = 0.001). The occurrence of the TLR7 rs179009 GG genotype was reduced in advanced HIV disease stage as compared with healthy controls (1.6% vs. 7.6%, OR = 0.14, P = 0.03). TLR7 rs179008 Gln11Leu polymorphism was associated with higher viral loads and accelerated progression to advanced immune suppression in HIV patients.<SEP>Most diseases are a consequence of a multifaceted interaction between an individual's genetic background and the environmental factors that individuals are exposed to. Gene-environment interaction describes the disease risk with individuals of different genotypes. Here, a case-only method is being adopted to evaluate gene-environment interaction. It is considered a better method. For a case-control association study of environmental influences, cases must have matched controls in the population. Therefore, we used a case-only study to evaluate the risk of HIV disease progression in alcohol and tobacco users. Individuals with HIV infection and excessive alcohol consumption had a negative impact on the CD4 cell count but not on combined antiretroviral therapy. In a study, a decreased response to antiretroviral therapy was observed in women who were smoking and having HIV infection. TLR7 rs179009AG genotype showed a risk for HIV disease progression among tobacco-consuming HIV patients (26.1% vs. 17.2%, OR = 1.71). However, the risk could not reach significance. This suggested that HIV-infected individuals consuming tobacco with TLR7 rs179009AG genotypes are more prone to HIV disease progression.<SEP>The present study has certain limitations. (1) It can address the association. (2) It cannot establish causation. (3) We did not study the effect of other region polymorphisms of TLR7 gene on HIV infection and disease progression due to lack of funds. (4) We had not addressed the DNA sequences corresponding to the expression of mRNAs coding for variants and the actual proteins responsible in the cells due to budgetary constraints. (5) The control population was not exposed to HIV. (6) The data for viral load and other clinical manifestations were not recorded in our clinical research proforma (CRF).<SEP>In summary, overall, TLR7 rs179008 polymorphisms did not correlate with susceptibility to the acquisition of HIV and disease progression. TLR7 rs179009AG genotype could be protective for the acquisition of HIV-1. However, TLR7 rs179009A/G polymorphism could assist in disease progression among tobacco users. TLR7 rs179008 TT genotype in individuals with early HIV disease and rs179009 AG genotype in individuals with advanced HIV disease could protect the advancement of HIV disease. As TLR7 is an important player to trigger the IFN-γ production, which exerts a direct antiviral effect through the inhibition of viral replication, it is also involved in the progression of HIV infection to AIDS. The present study should be validated with a bigger sample size in populations of other regions of India, since a limited study has been done concerning the influence of TLR7 rs179009A/G polymorphism on HIV infection and disease progression. Hence, to better understand the role of TLR7 rs179009A/G polymorphism in susceptibility to HIV infection and disease progression, further studies are needed.",17325,['FOODAL']
29441070,"Introduction<SEP>Cancer immunotherapy harnesses a patient’s CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses toward peptide neoantigens, which are displayed on the surface of tumor cells by major histocompatibility complex molecules [MHC, termed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in humans]. In the endogenous presentation pathway (MHC class I), abundantly expressed intracellular proteins are processed by the immunoproteasome and proteasome to yield short peptide fragments that are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum and assembled together with the MHC-I heavy chain and β2-microglobulin light chain (β2m) by the peptide-loading complex. The resulting peptide/MHC complexes (p/MHC) are further trafficked through the Golgi and eventually displayed on the cell surface, where they are surveilled by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) through specific interactions with αβ T cell receptors (TCRs). Through this process, a large and heterogeneous pool of p/MHC antigens is continuously generated in healthy, pathogen infected, or tumor cells as a means of displaying a cell’s peptide repertoire to the immune system. The display of high affinity peptides expressed exclusively by the tumor (i.e., neoepitopes) on MHC molecules can elicit specific CTL responses, which forms the basis of several established immunotherapies against cancers. One such therapy utilizes in vitro-activated, autologous CTLs to selectively target tumor cells. Alternatively, vaccines can be designed based on known antigens or CTLs can be engineered to introduce TCRs with desired specificities toward displayed tumor antigens. In all cases, neoepitopes derived from commonly mutated oncogenic proteins are well-suited immunotherapy targets if they have high affinity interactions with MHC alleles that are prevalent in the population.<SEP>Neuroblastoma (NBL) is a widely metastatic form of cancer that affects the development of nerve cells that comprise the sympathetic nervous system, primarily in patients younger than 10 years old. High-risk NBL has a survival rate of less than 50% after intensive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other approved treatments. In addition, patients responding positively to radiation treatments generally do not achieve long-term survival and suffer from cancer relapse, often with an increased rate of tumor mutations. Sequencing studies focusing on NBL of all stages indicate a wide spectrum of somatic mutations in tumors, which poses a significant challenge for the development of targeted therapeutics. Notably, mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) have been implicated in 9.2% of 240 NBL cases with available whole exome, genome, and transcriptome sequencing data from the TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) initiative. This and other sequencing data support ALK as the target with the highest mutation rate among high-risk NBL patients. Furthermore, genome sequencing of relapsed NBL tumors demonstrates retention of ALK mutations and/or acquisition of an ALK mutation in 14/54 and 10/23 samples. Such ALK mutations have been shown to hyperactivate the RAS–MAPK signaling pathway in NBL, driving cancer formation. More recent studies have also shown evidence of ALK overexpression in NBL tumors making it a viable target for CAR-mediated immunotherapy along with other targeted T cell therapies. Immunotherapy offers an attractive approach toward NBL treatment. However, despite significant progress in identifying recurrent mutations toward understanding the genetic basis of NBL, important molecular details regarding derived neoantigen/HLA interactions remain unknown, which further limits the development of targeted T cell therapies.<SEP>Here, we use our recently developed multilayered bioinformatics pipeline, Prediction of T Cell Epitopes for Cancer Therapy (ProTECT), to predict therapeutically relevant antigens in NBL tumors. ProTECT analysis of 106 patient samples from the NBL TARGET cohort identifies a recurring “hotspot” mutation in the ALK protein (R1275Q), together with its specificity toward common HLA alleles. Specifically, two putative peptide sequences with the R1275Q mutation, a nonamer and a decamer, are predicted to bind HLA-B*15:01 with high affinity according to consensus methods. X-ray structures of the two neoepitopes in complex with HLA-B*15:01 reveal a drastic change in peptide conformation, which correlates with increased thermal stability of the decamer neoepitope/HLA complex. For the self-peptide, unfavorable interactions between the peptide and residues in the MHC-binding groove prevent the formation of a stable complex. To evaluate the potential of the two ALK neoepitopes to interact with additional HLA alleles and predict structural features relevant for recognition by TCRs, we develop a high-throughput comparative modeling approach using the program Rosetta. Independent crystallographic analysis of a decamer-bound HLA-A*01:01 complex reveals a peptide conformation, which falls extremely close to our Rosetta model (within 1.1 Å backbone RMSD). Finally, tetramer staining of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-B*15:01-matched donors followed by flow cytometry analysis shows that the two different neoantigen conformations are recognized by CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our bioinformatics analysis, in vitro and structural characterization, computational modeling, and T cell recognition analysis illustrate a powerful approach toward high-throughput identification and optimization of broadly displayed putative neoantigen/HLA targets for further development toward cancer immunotherapy. Results from this approach provide strong evidence for broad HLA display of recurrent ALK-derived neoantigens expressed in NBL tumors and further suggest that the presentation of distinct neoepitope conformations in the HLA groove could drive specific CD8+ T cell responses in patients.","Materials and Methods<SEP>NBL Sample Data Collection and ProTECT Analysis<SEP>One hundred NBL sequencing trios (normal and tumor DNA-seq, and tumor RNA-seq) were downloaded from the National Cancer Institute Genomics Data Commons (NCI-GDC) using the GDC Data Transfer Tool. Samples were all downloaded in BAM format and then converted back to the native paired FASTQ format using the Picard SamToFastq module. Some of the RNA-seq BAM files had reads in the pair mapped with separate read groups. These files were converted to FASTQ using an in-house python script.1 We processed the samples from raw FASTQ trios to neoepitopes prediction at a rate of ~6 h/sample on four Microsoft Azure machines (Supplementary Data S1 in Supplementary Material). MHC haplotypes for MHC class I and MHC class II are called from the sequencing data using PHLAT. The haplotype for a sample is decided based on a consensus decision of the three input haplotypes. Somatic point mutations were called using a panel of five mutation callers, MuTECT, MuSE, RADIA, SomaticSniper, and Strelka. Since most mutation callers are DNA centric, we allow mutations rejected by up to two of the callers through this first filter. The vcf of first-pass mutants is subjected to SNPEff using indexes generated from the GENCODE v19 annotations for GRCh37. The accepted mutations are further filtered more stringently using an in-house tool, Transgene,2 before being translated into mutant peptides. Library construction for sequencing can induce artificial oxidation of guanine bases (OxoG) caused by high-energy sonication. These OxoG bases pair with thymine during PCR instead of their regular pairing partner, cytosine. This results in low allele fraction G>T or C>A substitutions seen predominantly in read 1 or read 2, respectively, in the FASTQ. Transgene filters variants arising solely form read 1 or read 2 in the alignment, and low allele-fraction mutants (<0.1 allele fraction) with no RNA-seq coverage. Since non-expressed proteins will never be picked up by the adaptive immune system, we filter events having low RNA-seq coverage. A mutation is filtered if the position has no evidence in the RNA (unexpressed ALT allele), there are reads spanning across, but none covering the position (splice variant), or if the gene is unexpressed. Filtered mutants are translated into peptides of length 2n − 1 for n = (9, 10, 15) using the GENCODE protein coding translations corresponding to the annotation used. Transcript-specific peptides are generated to account for known splice variants. The peptides generated by transgene are tested for binding against the inferred HLA haplotypes using the IEDB suite of MHC-I and MHC-II epitope predictors.3 Each 2n − 1-mer input peptide yields n calls for each allele in the HLA haplotype, for each n = (9, 10) for MHCI and n = 15 for MHC-II. Each call represents a combined consensus percent score of the peptide from a number of IEDB algorithms that have been trained on that MHC allele. These methods include an artificial neural network, a stabilized matrix method, a method that uses binding motif obtained from Combinatorial libraries, etc., and each method returns the percent rank of the input peptide:MHC combination versus a background set generated by the IEDB. The consensus score for a call is the median of the scores across all methods for that call. Peptides having a consensus percent score of greater than 5% (i.e., binders worse than the top 5% of the background set) are filtered as non-binders. Peptides having a consensus percent rank of greater than 5% (i.e., binders worse than the top 5% of a background set) are filtered as non-binders. The rank of the self-peptide for each filtered mutant is calculated using the same method. Peptides are grouped by the mutation and transcript(s) of origin into ImmunoActive Regions (IARs), i.e., regions likely to produce a peptide that will stimulate the immune system. IARs are ranked based on the affinity of the best contained binder, expression of the transcript(s) of origin, the promiscuity of the region (the predicted number of MHCs stimulated by peptides in the IAR), and the number of 10-mers in the IAR overlapping a 9-mer that binds to the same MHC as the 10-mer, with similar affinity. In the initial pilot, RNA-seq BAMs from six primary:relapsed pairs of samples were downloaded from the GDC and run through a reduced version of the pipeline using VCF files generated from the supplementary data from Eleveld et al. containing predicted mutations. MHC haplotypes for these samples were decided based on the consensus calls from the primary and relapsed RNA-seq. All samples were run through version 2.3.2 of the ProTECT pipeline (freely available Docker version at ) on Microsoft Azure standard_G5 (32 CPUs, 448GB RAM, 6TB disk) or standard_D15_v2 (20 CPUS, 140GB RAM, 1TB disk).<SEP>Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification<SEP>HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-A*01:01 genes containing a BirA tag were cloned into pET24+ plasmids and provided to us by the NIH Tetramer Core facility. For all in vitro experiments and the preparation of purified molecules for X-ray crystallography, we used soluble versions of the MHC heavy chain that lacks the BirA tag. Site directed mutagenesis to remove the BirA tag was performed using a QuikChange Lightning Multi-Site Kit (Agilent #210515) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting DNAs encoding HLA-B*15:01 (heavy chain), HLA-A*01:01 (heavy chain), and human β2M (light chain) were transformed into E. coli BL21-DE3 (Novagen), expressed as inclusion bodies, and refolded using previously described methods. Briefly, E. coli growths with autoinduction were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended with 25 mL BugBuster (MilliporeSigma #70584) per liters of culture. Cell lysate was sonicated and subsequently pelleted by centrifugation (5,180 × g for 20 min at 4°C) to collect inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were resuspended with 25 mL of wash buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.01% v/v deoxycholate), sonicated, and centrifuged again. Inclusion bodies were further resuspended in 25 mL of TE buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 2 mM EDTA) sonicated, and centrifuged. Following this, inclusion bodies are solubilized with 11 mL of resuspension buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, and 6 M guanidine–HCl). Solubilized inclusion bodies of heavy chain and light chain were mixed in a 1:3 M ratio and then added dropwise over 2 days to 1 L of refolding buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 2 mM EDTA, 0.4 M arginine HCl, 4.9 mM l-glutathione reduced, and 0.57 mM l-glutathione oxidized) containing 10 mg of synthetic peptide (Biopeptik). Refolding was performed for 4 days at 4°C without stirring then the sample was exhaustively dialyzed into SEC buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8 and 150 mM NaCl). Following this, the sample was concentrated with Labscale TFF system to 100 mL and further concentrated to a final volume of 5 mL using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal 10 kDa cutoff Filter Unit (Millapore Sigma). Purification was performed using SEC on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg with running buffer of 25 mM Tris pH 8 and 150 mM NaCl, followed by anion exchange chromatography using a mono Q 5/50 GL column and a 0–100% gradient of buffer A (25 mM Tris pH 8 and 50 mM NaCl) and buffer B (25 mM Tris pH 8 and 1 M NaCl). Finally, the purified protein was exhaustively buffer exchanged into 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.2 and 50 mM NaCl. The final sample was validated using LC–MS on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro MS instrument to confirm the presence of bound peptide.<SEP>MHC Tetramerization<SEP>HLA-B*15:01 containing BirA tag was refolded together with either synthetically produced AQDIYRASY or AQDIYRASYY peptide (Biopeptik) and purified following methods described earlier. Purified protein was concentrated to 0.5 mg/mL and 500 µg was biotinylated using a BirA biotin-protein ligase bulk reaction kit (Avidity Cat no. bulk BirA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. An SDS-PAGE gel shift assay was performed to confirm the efficiency of the biotinylation reaction according to previously published protocols. The biotinylated protein sample was concentrated to 200 µL and split into two approximately 200 µg aliquots. For streptavidin–PE tetramers, 31.8 µL of 1 mg/mL of streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (Prozyme cat no. PJRS25) was added 10 times in intervals of 10 min. For streptavidin–APC tetramers, 17.1 µL of 1 mg/mL streptavidin–allophycocyanin (Prozyme cat no. PJ27S) was added 10 times in intervals of 10 min. The final tetramer samples were stored at 4°C.<SEP>Protein Crystallization<SEP>Purified HLA-B*15:01/AQDIYRASY, HLA-B*15:01/AQDIYRASYY, and HLA-A*01:01/AQDIYRASYY complexes lacking a BirA biotinylation tag were used for crystallization. Proteins were concentrated to 10–12 mg/mL in 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, and crystal trays were set up using 1:1 protein-to-buffer ratio at room temperature. For HLA-B*15:01/AQDIYRASY, small crystals appeared in initial screening using molecular dimensions JCSG-plus screen after 3 days in 100 mM HEPES pH 6.5 and 20% PEG 6000 and they were further optimized. Diffraction quality crystals were harvested and incubated from above conditions plus Al’s oil as a cryoprotectant and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen before data collection. Diamond shaped diffraction quality crystals of HLA-B15:01/AQDIYRASYY were grown in crystallization buffer containing 100 mM HEPES, 2 M ammonium sulfate, and 2–4% PEG 400. Diffraction quality crystals of HLA-A*01:01/AQDIYRASYY were grown in 0.18 M magnesium chloride, 0.09 M sodium HEPES pH 7.5, 27% (v/v) PEG400, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in a buffer containing the crystallization condition supplemented with 25% glycerol. All crystals used in this study were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Data were collected from single crystals under cryogenic condition at Advanced Light Source (beam lines 8.3.1 and 5.0.1). Diffraction images were indexed, integrated, and scaled using Mosflm and Scala in the CCP4 package. Structures were determined by Phaser using a previous structure of HLA-B*15:01 (PDB ID 1XR8) and HLA-A*01:01 (PDB ID 1W72) as search models. Model building and refinement were performed using COOT and Phenix, respectively.<SEP>Differential Scanning Fluorimetry<SEP>All DSF experiments were performed using an Applied Biosystems ViiA qPCR machine with excitation and emission wavelengths at 470 nm and 569 nm respectively, according to previously described protocols. Each sample was run in triplicates of 50 μL total volume using a 96 well-plate format. Proteins were buffer exchanged into the assay buffer which was 20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.2 and 50 mM NaCl. Individual wells contained a final concentration of 7 µM of the respective proteins and 10× SYPRO orange dye (ThermoFisher). To determine thermal stability of each sample, the temperature incrementally increased at a scan rate of 1°C/min from 25 to 95°C. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Melting temperatures (Tm) were determined by fitting the melting curves to a Boltzmann sigmoidal fit.<SEP>Modeling MHC Molecules and Extracting Peptide/MHC-Binding Energies<SEP>The solved X-ray structure of HLA-B*15:01/AQDIYRASY complex was used to generate a structural model for HLA-B*15:01/ARDIYRASY using single-point mutagenesis in Pymol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8 Schrödinger, LLC.) All Dunbrack rotamers for the Arg2 side chain were considered manually, and the rotamer giving the lowest strain was used in our final structural model in Figure S6A in Supplementary Material. Peptide/MHC-binding energies were computed using the Rosetta software suite.4 Average binding energies of residue-specific interactions were calculated using the residue_energy_breakdown protocol in Rosetta.<SEP>To assess the ability of our ALK neoepitopes to bind to other HLA alleles, we performed homology-based structure simulations and computed p/MHC-binding energies in silico. An outline of our method is presented in Figure 4. Three-dimensional structural modeling and computation of p/MHC-binding affinities were performed using the Rosetta software suite (see text footnote 4). To carry out the modeling of homologous HLA alleles, we used RosettaCM protocol. The process of modeling high-resolution protein structures using RosettaCM primarily requires, that is, the sequence of the homolog is aligned with the sequence of a related known structure. It is subsequently followed by the generation of predicted 3D structures using restraints guided by a Monte Carlo sampling strategy. After performing the structure simulations of HLA alleles using our HLA-B*15:01 X-ray structure as a template, we carried out local refinement of the peptide and the MHC-binding groove. We kept backbone atoms fixed while allowing for conformational freedom of side-chain residues. The MHC-binding groove was defined by the HLA residues that were within 3.5 Å of the peptide. Local structure refinement allowed minimization of steric clashes introduced by the RosettaCM protocol. In addition, we refined only the peptide and the MHC-binding groove of the models to avoid noise that the full-atom refinement might introduce while trying to minimize the energy landscape at other regions and hence, making it difficult to extract accurate p/MHC-binding energies. At the local refinement stage, we generated a pool of refined structures from which we sampled low binding energy (or high-binding affinity) structures. Average binding energy was evaluated using the Rosetta energy function talaris2014. The computation of binding energies was performed in the following steps: (1) we trimmed the MHC PDB file to remove the β2m and α3 domains, such that only the α1/α2 domains that form the peptide-binding groove were retained. (2) We performed local refinement of the MHC-binding groove and the peptide using Rosetta’s relax protocol, which allows the region of focus to be in the local optimum of the Rosetta force field. Using the relax protocol, we obtained a pool of 100 locally refined models. (3) We computed the binding energies of the relaxed models using the InterfaceAnalyzer protocol by separating the MHC and the peptide energy contributions and subtracting them from the energy of the bound p/MHC. (4) We then selected the lowest 10 binding energy models and report their average binding energies. The sequence identity score was computed using the BLOSUM62 matrix because most of the HLA alleles (68%) showed up to 62% sequence similarity. To perform the simulation, we obtained the HLA sequences from European Bioinformatics Institute’s IPD-IMGT/HLA Database. We used ClustalOmega to perform multiple sequence alignment of the HLA alleles before converting the alignment to Rosetta’s internal alignment format for homology modeling. Kullback–Leibler sequence logos were generated as previously described. Rosetta simulations were performed at the UCSC Baker cluster using 13 compute nodes with 32 cores per compute node (AMD Opteron(tm), 2.4 GHz Processor 6378). The total time used to model 2,904 HLA sequences was approximately 20,000 core hours.<SEP>PBMC Staining<SEP>206 Cryopreserved PBMCs (CTL) from two healthy independent non-pooled HLA-B*15:01 donors were thawed and rested in phenol red free RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% l-glut, and 1% Pen/Strep at 37°C for at least 1 h. Four independent PBMC staining experiments were run for each donor. 36 PBMCs were used for the nonamer/HLA-B*15:01, decamer/HLA-B*15:01, and SARS/HLA-B*15:01 double staining experiment. 116 PBMCs were used for the decamer/HLA-B*15:01-APC and nonamer/HLA-B*15:01-PE experiment. After the resting period, cells were washed with 1× PBS, followed by staining with 4 µL of each tetramer, 5% CO2 for 10 min. An aqua amine-reactive dye (Invitrogen # L34957) was added for 10 min to assess cell viability, followed by the addition of an antibody cocktail (CD14, CD19, CD4, CD8) to stain for surface markers for an additional 20 min. The cells were washed with FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 1% BSA) and sorted using an Aria C Flow Cytometer. Analysis of percentage of reactive CD8+ T cells was performed following gating on forward/side scattering for live lymphocytes (FSC+/SSC−), gating on Qdot− for live cells and gating on CD4−/CD8+ T cells.","Results<SEP>Identification of ALK R1275Q Neoepitopes Using ProTECT<SEP>A reduced version of our software, ProTECT (Figure 1), was initially run on a batch of six primary:relapsed NBL sample pairs from the TARGET cohort. We find at least one neoepitope-generating mutation persisting in the relapsed tumor for five of six patients (Table S1 and Supplementary Data S1 in Supplementary Material). Among these are two well-known hotspot mutations, NRAS Q61K and ALK R1275Q (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). We predicted two HLA-B*15:01-restricted decamer (MAQDIYRASY and AQDIYRASYY) and one nonamer (AQDIYRASY) neoepitopes arising from ALK R1275Q in sample TARGET-30-PARHAM. The predicted binding affinities are better than 0.55, 0.85, and 2.1%, respectively, relative to all peptides in a background training set (the top 5% ranked peptides are considered true binders by our method). While the peptide beginning at M1273 is predicted to be the top binder, the two epitopes beginning at A1274 are more promising from an immunological perspective since they are predicted to be significantly better binders to HLA-B*15:01 than their parental self-antigens ARDIYRASYY (10.75 percentile score) and ARDIYRASY (35 percentile score).<SEP>Using the full version of the ProTECT software (manuscript in preparation), we expanded our study to 100 primary NBL samples in the TARGET cohort to collect more complete statistics on ALK R1275Q-derived neoepitopes, and to identify other recurrent neoepitopes in NBL (Table S1 and Supplementary Data S2 and S3 in Supplementary Material). We identify four additional samples harboring ALK R1275Q (TARGET-30-PANWRR, -PANXJL, -PAPTFZ, and -PAPTLV). None of these samples express HLA-B*15:01, but sample PAPTFZ displays a close relative, HLA-B*15:03 that is predicted to bind ARDIYRASYY and ARDIYRASY with scores of 2.2 and 4.7%, respectively. Two samples (PANXJL and PAPTLV) express the high-frequency HLA-A*02:01 (20% in Caucasian populations), where an ALK R1275Q nonamer (GMAQDIYRA) is predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01 with a 1.4% score.<SEP>All but six of the 100 samples harbor one or more non-synonymous neoepitope with low percentile scores for at least one expressed HLA allele. Among these we identify other recurrent mutations, including the ALK mutation F1174L/I/C, present in 3/2/1 samples, respectively, and a ZNF717 mutation (Q716), present in three samples (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). One sample in the cohort expresses NRAS Q61K, an activating mutation commonly found in melanoma, thyroid, and colorectal cancers. Finally, the NRAS-derived neoepitope ILDTAGKEEY arising from a single mutation (Q61K) is predicted to bind the common HLA-A*01:01 allele with a statistically significant score of 0.35%. Notably, the same HLA-A*01:01/ILDTAGKEEY interaction identified by our method has been previously shown to elicit a specific T cell response using a melanoma cell line.<SEP>ALK Tumor Neoantigens Form p/MHC Complexes with Distinct Stabilities In Vitro<SEP>The results obtained from ProTECT analysis provide a range of therapeutically relevant neoantigen/HLA interactions to validate and characterize using biophysical and structural methods. Given the extensive genetic evidence supporting a role for ALK mutations in NBL tumors, we chose to pursue further the interaction between ALK R1275Q and HLA-B*15:01. We prepared recombinant HLA-B*15:01 bound to the two ALK-derived neoantigens, a nonamer (AQDIYRASY) and a decamer (AQDIYRASYY). As a control, we attempted to prepare HLA-B*15:01 with the self-antigen (ARDIYRASY), which is predicted to have a >10-fold reduced binding affinity for the HLA. Peptide/MHC samples were refolded from purified Escherichia coli inclusion bodies in the presence of 10-fold molar excess peptide using standard methods and purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC traces of the nonamer and decamer samples show three distinct peaks corresponding to protein aggregate (22.8 min), p/MHC complex (29.5 min), and free β2m (42.7 min) (Figure 2A). Notably, the sample refolded using the self-antigen peptide shows only two peaks in the chromatogram, none of which contain non-aggregated p/MHC molecules (Figure 2A, green trace), further suggesting that the affinity of the self-antigen is insufficient to promote the formation of a stable complex with the HLA.<SEP>To confirm the presence of the neoepitopes in the two MHC samples, we performed liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy (LC–MS). LC–MS reveals a high relative abundance of the correct peptide in each sample, with observed masses of 1,086.70 and 1,249.71 Da, which agree well with the expected masses of the nonamer and decamer, respectively (Figures 2B,C). Thus, we confirm binding of the two tumor neoepitopes to recombinant HLA-B*15:01 prepared through in vitro refolding. To further characterize the resulting p/MHC molecules, we used a differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay, which can accurately assess kinetic stability. According to this technique, properly folded class I p/MHC complexes show melting temperatures (Tm) from 37 to 63°C, which correlate with predicted IC50 values in the micromolar to nanomolar range. Here, both neoantigen p/MHC samples show a clear unfolding transition with a highly reproducible Tm of 53.4°C for the nonamer and 59.3°C for the decamer complex (Figure 2D), suggesting that the decamer forms a higher affinity complex with HLA-B*15:01. Such a difference in thermal stabilities of the p/MHC complexes together with previous observations that peptide length influences its conformation within a fixed-length groove is consistent with a hypothesis that the two peptides are displayed via distinct binding modes, as previously reported for nonamer and decamer peptides sampling unique conformations within an MHC groove.<SEP>Structural Plasticity within the MHC Peptide-Binding Groove Enables Distinct Neoantigen Conformations<SEP>To elucidate the structural basis underlying the distinct stabilities observed for the two ALK neoepitopes and to further characterize peptide features displayed to TCRs we solved the X-ray structures of the nonamer (HLA-B*15:01/β2m/AQDIYRASY) (PDB ID 5TXS) and the decamer complex (HLA-B*15:01/β2m/AQDIYRASYY) (PDB ID 5VZ5). The nonamer complex crystallized in the P212121 space group at a resolution of 1.7 Å, while the decamer complex crystallized in the P6122 space group at a resolution of 2.6 Å (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). The nonamer peptide adopts a canonical extended conformation promoted by the N-terminal (Ala1, Gln2) and C-terminal (Tyr9) anchors, which are deeply embedded within A/B, and F-pockets of the HLA groove (Figures 3A,B), respectively. This anchoring results in a “curved” conformation, where the backbone of residues from Asp3 to Ser8 is pushed toward the upper part of the groove while the remaining residues are maintained within the C, D, and E pockets (Figure 3B). A survey of previously deposited HLA-B*15:01-restricted antigens in the PDB (LEKARGSTY derived from Epstein–Barr virus, PDB ID 1XR8; ILGPPGSVY derived from human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme-E2, PDB ID 1XR9; VQQESSFVM derived from SARS coronavirus, PDB ID 3C9N) reveals other nonamer epitopes consistently in extended conformations, in agreement with the conformation of the ALK nonamer neoepitope in our X-ray structure (Figures S4A–D in Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the overall architecture of the B*15:01-binding groove is similar between the different structures with heavy atom backbone RMSDs of less than 1 Å (Figure S4E in Supplementary Material). Comparison between the peptide amino acid sequences reveals excellent agreement with the established HLA-B*15:01-binding motifs, where LMQ/AEISTV and FY/LM are preferred/tolerated in anchor positions 2 and 9, respectively (Figures S4F,G in Supplementary Material). Thus, the X-ray structure of our ALK-derived nonamer neoepitope is consistent with established structural features in the PDB, suggesting a trend where the peptide backbone conformation is defined by its length and anchor motifs.<SEP>Generally, peptides of length greater than nine amino acids either bulge further out of the binding groove or form a “zig-zag” conformation. However, in our decamer complex structure (Figures 3C,D), the peptide adopts a short 310 helical backbone conformation from Ile4 to Ala7, as confirmed by an inspection of φ/ψ backbone dihedral angles (Figure S1A in Supplementary Material). Notably, while the N-terminal anchor residues are identical in the nonamer and decamer peptide, Tyr10 of the decamer replaces Tyr9 of the nonamer as the C-terminal anchor residue in a similar conformation (Figures 3B,D). The accommodation of a longer peptide sequence within the fixed-size MHC groove is thus achieved through the formation of a more compact 310 helix for the decamer, relative to the extended nonamer backbone. In addition, the 310 helix buries Arg6 further into the MHC groove and creates an amphipathic structure where Ile4, Tyr5, Ser8, and Tyr9 are oriented toward the solvent (Figure 3D). A structural superposition of the nonamer and decamer peptides (2.7 Å backbone heavy atom RMSD) highlights the changes in residues that are oriented toward the solvent, suggesting that the two epitopes display very different surface features for interactions with TCRs (Figures 3E–G).<SEP>The compaction of the peptide backbone in the decamer structure is accompanied by structural adaptations of MHC residues in the peptide-binding groove. In particular, in the decamer complex the HLA α2 helix undergoes a significant widening involving a 5.1 Å displacement of the Cα atom of Arg151. This movement is driven by a change in orientation of Arg151, which points toward the solvent in the nonamer versus toward the groove in the decamer complex (Figures S2A,B in Supplementary Material), and the burying of Arg6 further toward the floor of the groove. Thus, the addition of a C-terminal Tyr in the peptide sequence drastically alters the tertiary structure of the HLA complex, driven by a widely different peptide conformation that can be accommodated through conformational plasticity within a malleable MHC groove.<SEP>Key structural parameters extracted from our crystallographic analysis provide insights into the increased stability of the decamer/HLA complex. Notably, the buried surface area (BSA) between HLA-B*15:01 and the decamer peptide is 1,986 Å2, relative to 800 Å2 in the nonamer structure. To further dissect different structural features for their contributions to p/MHC stability, we analyzed all polar (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and electrostatic interactions) and hydrophobic interactions involving HLA residues (Figure S5 and Table S3 in Supplementary Material). Specifically, the decamer peptide forms additional intra-peptide hydrogen bonds as a result of the more compacted 310 helix conformation. In addition, the decamer participates in 25 polar and 21 hydrophobic interactions with the MHC residues, while the nonamer forms 26 polar but only 11 hydrophobic interactions with the groove (Figure S5A in Supplementary Material). Specifically, Asp3 and Arg6 of the decamer peptide extend further into the groove, forming additional contacts with HLA side chains (Figures S5B,C in Supplementary Material). Our structural analysis suggests that an increase in the total number of intra-peptide hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic packing interactions, consistently with an increase in BSA brought on by the more compact 310 helical conformation, leads to an improved stability of the decamer complex, as confirmed independently by our DSF experiments (Figure 2B).<SEP>Structural Exclusion of the Self-antigen from the HLA-B*15:01 Groove<SEP>To further evaluate the potential immunogenicity of the ALK R1275Q neoepitopes, we compared their affinity for HLA-B*15:01 relative to the self-peptide (ARDIYRASY). Formation of a stable HLA complex displaying the self-peptide would compromise the therapeutic relevance of any related neoantigen, due to immune tolerance mechanisms that limit the repertoire of responsive T cells. Preliminary attempts to refold HLA-B*15:01 using a synthetic nonamer peptide with the parental ALK sequence did not result in efficient p/MHC formation, suggesting low binding affinity, likely in the micromolar range (Figure 2A, green trace). To further explore the basis of this exclusion we performed structural modeling of the self-peptide/HLA-B*15:01 complex, using our solved X-ray structure of the nonamer complex as a template. We find that performing the reverse Gln to Arg substitution leads to steric hindrance between the longer Arg2 side chain and residues of the MHC-binding groove (Figure S6A in Supplementary Material). Despite a careful consideration of all possible Arg side-chain rotamers, significant clashes remain with Ser67 on the α1 helix, as well as with Ala24, Met45 on the floor of the MHC groove (Figure S6A in Supplementary Material). As expected from the conservation of peptide residue anchors in the A- and B-pockets, we observe similar clashes when the self-decamer is modeled with HLA-B*15:01. By contrast, the neoepitope Gln2 side chain fits well into the B-pocket, forming an additional hydrogen bond Tyr9 from the HLA heavy chain (Figure S6B in Supplementary Material, cyan dotted line). Finally, we performed detailed structure modeling calculations using simultaneous optimization of the peptide backbone in addition to the side-chain degrees of freedom and ranked the calculated affinities of the three peptides for HLA-B*15:01 according to a physically realistic energy function. The self-antigen complexes yield the least favorable binding energies, followed by the nonamer, and finally the decamer complex (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). Thus, our structural analysis is highly consistent with our in vitro results, i.e., that the self-peptide is excluded from binding, in sharp contrast with the nonamer and decamer neoepitopes which form tight complexes with the HLA.<SEP>Evaluating the HLA-Binding Repertoire Using Comparative Modeling Calculations<SEP>A patient’s HLA haplotype plays a major role in determining the outcome of targeted cancer immunotherapies. Therefore, toward expanding the range of individuals that could mount a T cell response to ALK R1275Q neoepitopes, we evaluated the potential of other HLAs to display the two peptides in silico. Here, we developed and applied a high-throughput approach which exploits the availability of our high-resolution X-ray structures for the two neoepitopes to simultaneously predict peptide/HLA interactions and surface features of peptide residues poised for interactions with TCRs. First, we selected a non-redundant set of 2,904 HLA alleles (885 HLA-A, 1,405 HLA-B, and 614 HLA-C unique sequences) from the EMBL-EBI database. We then carried out detailed Rosetta comparative modeling calculations for each allele, using our experimentally determined HLA-B*15:01 structures for the nonamer and decamer ALK peptides as templates (Figure 4). In contrast to previous structure-based peptide/HLA modeling methods which use a flexible peptide docking approach, we used a fixed-peptide backbone threading approach followed by energy minimization of the interacting peptide and HLA residues to drastically confine the docking degrees of freedom. Our approach was motivated the observation that the peptide backbone conformation shows minimal variance (less than 1.5 Å RMSD) in all nonamer/HLA-B*15:01 structures reported in the PDB (Figure S4E in Supplementary Material). Using this strategy, we extracted highly reproducible binding energies for both the nonamer and decamer peptides, which are maintained in extended and 310 helical conformations, respectively, in the resulting models (Figure S7 in Supplementary Material). As expected, the HLA-B*15 alleles rank systematically among the top binders, indicating a high degree of groove complementarity to both peptides (Figure 5; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, purple). Among those, the HLA-B*15:84 allele shows the lowest binding energy for the decamer (Figure 5A, black circle), whereas the HLA-B*15:107 allele shows the lowest binding energy for the nonamer (Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, black circle). A total of 116 HLA alleles from all A, B, and C types exhibit lower binding energies for both the nonamer and decamer peptides than our initial HLA-B*15:01 structural templates (Figure 5A; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, red square), suggesting the potential for a broader HLA display repertoire.<SEP>To elucidate a sequence bias for specific residues in the HLA-binding groove that consistently yield more favorable interactions with the two peptides, we analyzed the average binding energy as a function of sequence identity score, calculated relative to the best binding allele for each peptide (Figure 4). As a negative control, we computed the binding energy for a mock HLA allele in which all residues in the MHC-binding groove are mutated to Ala. As expected, the mock polyAla HLA exhibits a low binding affinity (i.e., high-binding energy) to the peptide and is distant from the best binding allele (Figure 5; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, green triangle, top left). We observe an evident correlation between the computed binding energies and sequence similarity to the top binder. Our approach additionally allows us to decompose residue specific contributions to overall binding energy for each peptide–HLA combination. We find a clear trend for both the nonamer and decamer peptides with a set of HLA alleles where a bulk of the binding energy is provided by the “anchor” positions (Figures S11A,B in Supplementary Material). By contrast, the mock polyAla HLA exhibits considerably higher binding energy across the entire peptide length (Figures S11A,B in Supplementary Material). To elucidate key sequence features that allow the peptides to be accommodated in the MHC groove, we derived a sequence profile among good binders for the two neoepitopes. Such features are highlighted in the Kullback–Leibler sequence logo, which reveals preferred residues in the HLA peptide-binding groove (Figure 5B; Figure S8B in Supplementary Material). According to this metric, highly invariant residues in the MHC-binding groove should play an essential role in mediating peptide/MHC interactions, as they are consistently observed in HLA alleles that exhibit high affinity binding. A close inspection of our structural models for the nonamer and decamer bound to a common allele in our data set, HLA-A*01:01, reveals similar polar contacts, primarily in the A-, B-, and F-pockets, that correlate well with the positions of invariant MHC residues (Figures 5C,D; Figures S8C,D in Supplementary Material). Specifically, both the nonamer and decamer C-terminal anchors employ a similar interaction pattern in the F-pocket with conserved Thr, Lys, Trp, and Tyr residues of the MHC (Figures 5B,D; Figure S8B,D in Supplementary Material).<SEP>To test the validity of our structure-based simulations, we performed in vitro refolding of the ALK-derived nonamer and decamer peptides with HLA-A*01:01. This allele was chosen because it is a high-frequency allele in multiple populations worldwide and has been previously shown to form stable recombinant p/MHC complexes for structural characterization. As observed in our previous experiments with HLA-B*15:01 (Figure 2A), refolding of HLA-A*01:01 with decamer or nonamer peptide results in a stable p/MHC complex (Figures S8E and S9A in Supplementary Material). Further characterization of the purified complex reveals a thermal stability of 47.9°C for the decamer (Figure S9B in Supplementary Material) and 46.7°C for the nonamer (Figure S8F in Supplementary Material), suggesting that both ALK neoepitopes have a lower affinity for HLA-A*01:01 compared with HLA-B*15:01 (Figure 2D, 59.3°C), consistently with our binding energy calculations (Figure 5A; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material). Although certain HLA and H2 MHC alleles have been previously reported to yield partially folded, peptide-free molecules with measurable thermal stabilities, control refolding experiments performed without peptide for each of our HLA alleles failed to yield a stable complex. Finally, to conclusively test the atomic features predicted by our simulations, we determined the X-ray structure of decamer complex HLA-A*01:01/β2m/AQDIYRASYY (PDB ID 6AT9). The decamer complex crystallized in the P32221space group at a resolution of 2.9 Å (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). Inspection of crystallographic φ/ψ dihedral angles reveals that the peptide backbone also adopts a short 310 helix conformation when bound to HLA-A*01:01, suggesting that the peptide length is the main determinant of its conformation in the groove, and further justifying our fixed-backbone modeling approach (Figure S9F in Supplementary Material). The peptide conformation in the X-ray structure shows excellent agreement with our Rosetta model (1.1 backbone heavy atom RMSD), with several high-resolution features predicted by the model are confirmed by the X-ray, including polar contacts within both the A- and F-pockets of the MHC groove (Figures 5C–F; Figure S12 in Supplementary Material). Specifically, the side-chain hydroxyl group of the peptide Tyr10 is in contact with the same Tyr, Lys, and Trp side-chain atoms from the F-pocket (Figures 5D,F). Finally, in comparison with the X-ray structure of the same peptide bound to HLA-B*15:01, the side chain of Arg6 is flipped outwards from the groove when bound to HLA-A*01:01 altering the peptide surface displayed to TCRs (Figures S9D,E in Supplementary Material). Thus, our independent X-ray structure corroborates the trend observed in our structure-based binding energy simulations and further supports the potential for other HLA molecules to display the recurrent ALK neoepitopes with unique TCR interaction properties.<SEP>The Two ALK-Derived Neoepitopes Are Recognized by CD8+ T Cells<SEP>Given the unique conformations and surface features observed for the nonamer and decamer peptides, we sought to determine whether the two altered-self (i.e., mutated) neoantigens could be recognized by CD8+ T cells using a MHC tetramer staining assay followed by multichannel flow cytometry analysis. We hypothesized that an HLA-matched donor would be able to recognize altered-self neoepitopes in the periphery, as long as the peptide adopts a conformation that can potentiate interactions with TCRs. To test this, we acquired PBMCs from two HLA-B*15:01-matched healthy donors. For each peptide, we performed a double staining experiment using HLA-B*15:01 tetramers conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC) or phycoerythrin (PE), toward identification of T cells that recognize each neoepitope. Final cell sorting using fluorescence-based detection results in identification of double positive populations with a total of 0.012% CD8+ T cells reactive to the nonamer (Figure S13A in Supplementary Material), and 0.024% reactive to the decamer epitope (Figure S13B in Supplementary Material). Notably, these findings were very similar between two independent staining experiments using PBMCs from individual donors (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material). As a control, we additionally performed staining experiments using tetramers made for HLA-B*15:01 complexed with an immunodominant SARS coronavirus-derived epitope (VQQESSFVM). For double staining experiments with HLA-B*15:01/SARS tetramers, we observe double positive populations corresponding to 0.007 and 0.014% reactive CD8+ T cells (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material). Finally, simultaneous staining experiments using nonamer/HLA-B*15:01-PE and decamer/HLA-B*15:01-PE tetramers did not uncover populations of CD8+ T cells that recognized both epitopes (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material). Thus, CD8+ T cells are able to recognize both neoepitopes with nominal frequencies that are comparable to that of a known immunodominant epitope.","Discussion<SEP>Immunotherapies that stimulate the immune system to attack tumors, including immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell therapies, have achieved spectacular results in tumor types with high mutational burden, such as melanoma. However, their utility in tumors with lower mutational burden, such as those that occur in pediatric cancers, is less clear. The development of more targeted T cell based immunotherapies to treat cancer relies on understanding the molecular basis of neoepitope display on tumor cells, in addition to the initiation and regulation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. A current roadblock in the development of robust approaches across patients is that the HLA locus is extremely polymorphic, and an individual’s exact HLA haplotype sculpts the repertoire of epitopes displayed to the immune system. Moreover, the identification of therapeutically relevant antigens in tumors remains extremely challenging and is further complicated by the fact that a single HLA allele can potentially bind 103–106 distinct peptide epitopes. Traditionally, in vitro measurements of affinities between an MHC and a potential antigen were achieved by equilibrium dialysis and fluorescence polarization experiments. More recent approaches allow for a global evaluation of the entire peptide repertoire, using mass spectroscopy of MHC complexes extracted from cell lines expressing a single HLA allele followed by bioinformatics analysis. Robust alternative strategies to identify and characterize neoepitope/HLA complexes with desired T cell recognition features would significantly bolster the progress of targeted T cell therapies against cancer.<SEP>We have recently developed ProTECT, a fully automated and freely available tool for predicting expressed neoepitopes based on the somatic mutations present in tumor samples. In NBL, a common pediatric cancer, ProTECT analysis identifies a range of intriguing predicted high affinity neoepitope–HLA targets that should be examined in future studies, such as NRAS:Q61K—HLA-A*01:01 (Table S1 in Supplementary Material), including the ALK neoepitopes examined in detail here. Typically, Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)-based binding prediction methods are biased towards nonamer peptides due to limited number of datasets for peptide/MHC-binding affinity measurements of shorter or longer peptide lengths. Moreover, affinity thresholds for binding based on IC50 values are HLA allele specific and range from 60 to 950 nM, which could result in false negative predictions where weak binding epitopes that may be immunogenic are not considered. We attempt to normalize for these limitations in ProTECT by using a suite of predictors trained on combined and/or allele-specific datasets that consider a range of epitope-binding affinities. In our analysis, we find that 90% of the NBL samples have one or more predicted high affinity neoepitope–HLA targets. We sought to characterize the nature of the p/MHC interactions resulting from the relatively common ALK R1275Q mutation, to lay the groundwork for developing a targeted immunotherapy for it, and to develop a pipeline for evaluating other promising tumor neoepitopes. Toward these goals, we have elucidated the structural characteristics underlying the in vitro stability and presentation of two ALK R1275Q-derived nonamer and decamer epitopes where the corresponding self-peptide does not bind to the same HLA groove. We additionally developed and applied a high-throughput comparative modeling approach to identify additional HLA alleles that could display the two neoepitopes and predict their structures with high accuracy, toward understanding the link between peptide surface features and interactions with TCRs. Finally, we examined the potential for the ALK-derived neoepitope/HLA complexes to activate an immune response by analyzing CD8+ T cell recognition from HLA-B*15:01-matched donors.<SEP>The exact conformation and dynamic features of the peptide within the MHC-I-binding groove are known to play pivotal roles in recognition by CD8+ T cells, by dictating MHC/peptide-binding affinity, stability on the cell surface and cross-reactivity of interactions with specific TCR molecules. Our X-ray structures reveal an extreme case of such conformational plasticity, in which the addition of a single C-terminal Tyr in the neoantigen sequence (AQDIYRASY to AQDIYRASYY) significantly alters the peptide conformation (Figures 3E–G). This dramatic change relative to the canonical extended structure is highlighted by the formation of a 310 helix spanning residues Ile4 to Ala7 (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material) and provides a link between peptide conformation and HLA complex stability. Specifically, the 310 helix leads to an increase in BSA and number of molecular interactions between the peptide and HLA side chains (Figure S5 in Supplementary Material), in agreement with its increased thermal stability (Figure 2D). We additionally observed changes in the HLA groove, including a displacement of the α2 helix that undergoes a significant widening involving a 5.1 Å movement of the Cα atom of Arg151 (Figure S2A,B in Supplementary Material). Our results further support the importance of the α2 helix, which participates in a myriad of immune processes, such as chaperone-mediated peptide loading/editing, allele-specific antigen presentation, and TCR recognition, in the context of conformational plasticity of the MHC groove to accommodate epitopes of varying length. Finally, structure modeling of the self-antigen sequence, in agreement with in vitro refolding experiments, shows a sharp contrast in stability relative to the neoantigens due to an Arg anchor that cannot be accommodated on either an extended or helical backbone conformation. Our results provide a rational approach for improving neoepitope/HLA complex stability and half-life on the cell surface, relative to unstable self-epitope/HLA complexes, through optimizing the peptide backbone conformation in addition to anchor residue interactions. This could ultimately lead to the selection of more efficient neoantigens, consistently with previous studies showing that the ability of tumor antigens to induce T cell responses that prevent tumor relapse correlates with p/MHC stability.<SEP>As not all cancer patients who harbor a tumor-specific mutation that results in a neoepitope have the same HLA haplotype, it would be extremely beneficial to expand the repertoire of HLA molecules that bind and present a given therapeutic target. While sequence-based tools available at the IEDB can provide highly reliable predictions of epitope binding for a range of HLA alleles, structural details of the predicted epitope/HLA complex relevant for interactions with TCRs are not provided by such methods. Complementary methods have been used to model interactions within peptide/HLA complexes by leveraging high-resolution structural data available in the PDB. These approaches employ flexible peptide docking to construct sequence specificity profiles by exploring different peptide/HLA combinations. Here, we utilize a comparative modeling approach with a fixed-peptide backbone while allowing for side-chain flexibility within the HLA groove to screen a large pool of HLA alleles for binding to our ALK-derived nonamer and decamer neoantigens (Figure 5; Figure S8 in Supplementary Material). High-ranking HLA alleles according to Rosetta’s binding energy consistently demonstrate a low percentile rank using the epitope prediction method recommended by IEDB, which further suggests a high probability of forming a tight complex with the neoepitopes (Figure S10 in Supplementary Material). We subsequently test our binding predictions and show that both the nonamer and decamer peptides form a stable complex with the common HLA-A*01:01 in vitro, albeit with decreased stability compared with the HLA-B*15:01 bound complex (Figure 2D; Figures S8 and S9 in Supplementary Material). The accuracy of the Rosetta models is highlighted by a comparison to our decamer/HLA-A*01:01 X-ray structure, which shows a backbone RMSD of 1.1 Å (Table S5 and Figure S12 in Supplementary Material). Our fixed-backbone approach is further supported by the observation that the conformation of the peptide backbone is maintained among X-ray structures containing different, high affinity nonamer peptides bound to HLA-B*15:01 (Figure S4E in Supplementary Material). Moreover, comparison of the decamer peptide conformation when bound to HLA-B*15:01 versus HLA-A*01:01, two alleles that share 51% of groove residues according to a pairwise sequence alignment, shows only a modest change (1.6 Å backbone RMSD) (Table S5 in Supplementary Material). In stark contrast, we observe a significant conformational change between the nonamer and decamer peptides in their crystallographic complexes with the same HLA-B*15:01 allele (2.7 Å backbone RMSD). These results suggest that peptide length defines the backbone conformation through the conservation of anchor residue interactions within a fixed-size class I MHC groove. This feature of peptide binding allows us to confidently model patient-specific neoepitope/HLA interactions in a high-throughput manner, using a single crystal structure containing the same peptide as template. Finally, our approach allows us to predict surface features of neoepitope/HLA complexes available for interactions with TCR molecules, toward further evaluating their immunogenicity. Within the current scope of our method, Rosetta accounts for conformational plasticity within the MHC groove by allowing for side-chain rotamer and limited backbone flexibility. Thus, accurate modeling of epitope binding is achieved given the template contains an MHC groove that is accommodated for a fixed-peptide length (i.e., to model a nonamer epitope, a template X-ray structure for a nonamer/HLA complex should be used). However, our current protocol cannot account for large changes in the backbone of the groove, which may be required to model peptides of shorter or longer length. Future improvements in our structure-based prediction procedure that account for this may be achieved using Rosetta’s Comparative Modeling (RosettaCM) hybridize or RosettaRemodel.<SEP>To screen for CD8+ T cells that could recognize the tumor neoantigens, we focused our analysis on lymphocyte samples from healthy donors. We identify populations of CD8+ T cells which recognize our two ALK neoepitopes in a highly specific manner and with minimum cross-reactivity between them (Figures S13A–C in Supplementary Material). We observe approximately half the frequency (0.012 and 0.017%) of reactive CD8+ T cells for the HLA-B*15:01/nonamer tetramers relative to the frequency (0.024 and 0.028%) observed for HLA-B*15:01/decamer tetramers (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material), which may suggest differences in T cell recognition between the two epitopes. In addition, the percentage of reactive T cells against our two neoepitopes is comparable to values observed for the immunodominant SARS epitope (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material). While the nominal frequency of T cells specific for most p/MHC molecules ranges from 0.00005 to 0.01%, our observed values for HLA-B*15 tetramers are within the range of specific T cells identified in previous reports of PBMC staining of healthy donors using HLA-B*15 tetramers. Our staining results support the recognition of our putative nonamer and decamer neoepitopes by CD8+ T cells, potentiating the ability for the epitopes to drive specific immune responses. Engagement of TCR molecules and triggering of signaling of CD8+ T cells are driven by interactions between the TCR complementarity-determining regions and specific peptide/HLA structural motifs. Our detailed structural characterization provides further insight in the unique features that give rise to very distinct interface chemistries displayed by the two neoepitopes. It is likely the interplay between HLA complex stability and peptide surface features guides the engagement of CD8+ pools by the two neoantigens. Future studies in our group aim to identify the TCR(s) that can recognize our HLA displayed ALK neoepitopes toward the goal of characterizing the interface of the p/MHC–TCR complexes. Structural characterization of ALK p/MHC–TCR complexes will allow us to understand how the conformational plasticity observed in our nonamer and decamer neoepitopes dictates CD8+ T cell recognition toward fostering the development of p/MHC–TCR complexes with improved stability in the immunological synapse.<SEP>In summary, we outline a novel approach toward robust, high-throughput identification and detailed characterization of highly stable putative neoantigen/HLA targets with desired T cell recognition features for cancer immunotherapy. Recently established technologies have enabled high-throughput, parallel detection of T cell specificities for a wide spectrum of epitopes through the combinatorial encoding of p/MHC multimers. Such methods have already been applied to monitor the prevalence of T cells that are reactive for established tumor epitopes. In addition, vaccination of cancer patients that display neoantigens can elicit a broad T cell response, both in terms of specificity and clonal diversity. The success of future cancer immunotherapies based on these technologies will depend on the ability to fine-tune the desired T cell responses toward specific tumor epitopes. Our data suggest that malleable structural features of the target neoepitope/MHC complex can be harnessed to achieve such a fine-tuning. Thus, our characterization of recurring, T cell-reactive neoepitopes together with their HLA specificities and molecular determinants of stability provide new screening tools and therapeutic targets to enable the development of personalized immunotherapies against NBL tumors.",60345,['FOODAL']
29547969,"Introduction<SEP>Phosphorylcholine (PC) is an epitope on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), apoptotic cells and several pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pneumococcal vaccination has been shown to decrease atherosclerotic lesion formation in animal models, maybe because of this molecular mimicry. PC is reported to be important in oxLDL-induced immune activation. PC-targeting immunization can reduce atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E knockout mice, in which the immunoglobulin M and G against PC (IgM and IgG anti-PC) are increased, although neither the general IgM nor IgG are increased. IgM anti-PC has the ability to inhibit uptake of oxLDL by macrophages and increase clearance of apoptotic cells. Therefore, IgM anti-PC has been put forward as a potential novel biomarker for several diseases such as autoimmune diseases, stroke and coronary heart disease. About 40% of IgM anti-PC variation can be attributed to genetics, but the associated genetic variants have not been identified so far.<SEP>PC also links to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a B-cell malignancy usually occurring in older age. The antibodies derived from CLL cell lines have been reported to recognize limited target structures including oxLDL and PC. Among 10 types of respiratory tract infections, only pneumonia has been reported to be associated with increased risk of CLL. However, the phenotypic relationship between IgM anti-PC and CLL has not been statistically evaluated.<SEP>In this study, we aim to identify the genetic variants regulating serum level of IgM anti-PC by conducting genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in four Swedish cohorts; and to evaluate the association between IgM anti-PC and CLL risk in a nested case–control study.","Materials and Methods<SEP>Phenotype and genotype in each cohort<SEP>Four Swedish cohorts (European-ancestry participants) were involved in this study: TwinGene, PIVUS (Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors), MDC (Malmö Diet and Cancer) and PRACSIS (Prognosis and Risk in Acute Coronary Syndromes in Sweden). These studies were approved by the local ethics committees, and all participants gave informed consent.<SEP>According to the same manufacturer’s protocol (CVDefine®, Athera Biotechnologies AB, Stockholm, Sweden), serum level of IgM anti-PC was measured by indirect non-competitive enzyme immunoassay in each cohort. IgM anti-PC was expressed as units per milliliter (U/ml), by using a six-point calibrators curve containing IgM anti-PC levels ranging from 0 to 100U/ml. Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood of participants in each cohort, DNA samples that passed sample quality control (QC) were sent to SNP genotyping. The 1000 Genome reference panel (GRCh 37/hg 19, Phase 1, version 3) was used for imputation in four cohorts, by using IMPUTE 2 in PIVUS and MDC, Mach 1.0 and Minimac in TwinGene and PRACSIS, respectively.<SEP>TwinGene is a population-based cohort of twins collected between 2004 and 2008, including 12 591 subjects born between 1911 and 1958; in which 1018 complete twin pairs (2036 individuals) were randomly selected to measure IgM anti-PC and estimate the heritability. Genomic DNA from all available dizygotic twins and one member of each monozygotic twin pair were genotyped by using Illumina OmniExpress BeadChip. Genotyping QC exclusion criteria: genotypic or individual missingness > 0.03, minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) P < 10−7, sex mismatch, heterozy-gosity (individuals with an F-statistic beyond ±5SD from the sample mean), or cryptic relatedness.<SEP>PIVUS cohort started in 2001 and includes a random sample of 1016 subjects who were 70 years old and living in the community of Uppsala. All participants were measured with IgM anti-PC and genotyped by Illumina OmniExpress BeadChip and Metabochip. Genotyping QC exclusion criteria: monomorphic SNPs, MAF < 0.01, genotypic missingness > 0.05 for SNPs with MAF > 0.05, or genotypic missingness > 0.01 for SNPs with MAF < 0.05, HWE P < 10−6, individual missingness > 0.01, sex mismatch, heterozygosity (beyond ±3SD from the mean), duplicated samples, identity-by-descent (IBD) match, ethnic outliers.<SEP>MDC study is a prospective cohort including about 30000 participants who live in Malmö city. IgM anti-PC was measured in 1042 individuals within a nested case–control sub-study for cardiovascular disease. SNPs were genotyped by Illumina OmniExpressExome BeadChip, with genotyping QC exclusions criteria as follows: genotypic or individual missingness > 0.05; IBD match; heterozygosity (absolute cryptic relatedness inbreeding coefficient > 0.20); sex mismatch; or population outliers.<SEP>PRACSIS cohort is a prospective risk stratification program, which including consecutive patients (18–79 years of age) with acute coronary syndrome but without other life threatening diseases from 1995 to 2001. IgM anti-PC levels for 1185 patients were measured in blood samples collected within 24h of admission. Genotyping of 1268 patients was performed by using Illumina OmniExpressExome BeadChip. Genotyping QC exclusion criteria: sex mismatch, genotypic or individual missingness > 0.03, heterozygosity (beyond ±3SD from the mean), duplicated or related individuals (IBD > 0.185), divergent ancestry (principal component analysis with HapMap populations), MAF < 0.01 or HWE P < 10−7.<SEP>Raw values of IgM anti-PC were adjusted for age and sex in the linear regression model, after removing outliers (beyond ±4SD from the mean), residuals from the regression model were rank order normalized to achieve standard normal distribution. After phenotype and genotype matching, individuals with both IgM anti-PC measurements and SNPs available (1175 from TwinGene, 945 from PIVUS, 882 from MDC and 646 from PRACSIS) were used in our GWAS.<SEP>GWAS meta-analysis<SEP>Firstly, discovery GWAS was performed in three cohorts: TwinGene, PIVUS and MDC; by using PLINK in TwinGene, SNPTEST (version 2.5) in PIVUS and MDC. Analyses were restricted to autosomal SNPs with imputation quality (info or r 2) higher than 0.4. The first four principal components (first two for PIVUS because all individuals were of the same ethnicity and geographical area) were used as covariates in linear regression model to control population stratification. The “--within” option in PLINK was used to statistically adjust for relatedness (complete dizygotic twin pairs) in TwinGene. Manhattan and quantile–quantile plots were drawn by using qqman package in R 3.4.1, and the regional plot was generated from LocusZoom tool. Fixed-effect meta-analysis of three discovery IgM anti-PC GWAS results was performed by METAL (weighted by sample size). Genome-wide significant SNPs (P<5.0×10−8) from the discovery GWAS meta-analysis were validated in PRACSIS study (n = 646). The replicated SNPs were meta-analyzed by using the metaphor package in R 3.4.1.<SEP>PRS and effect sizes correlation analysis<SEP>PRS analysis was performed by using summary GWAS results of IgM anti-PC (from our meta-analysis of three discovery studies, total n = 3002), general IgM [public data including SNPs with P < 1 × 10−6 among ~19000 individuals from Jonsson et al. ] as the bases, and CLL (from the InterLymph consortium, including 3100 unrelated cases and 7677 controls) as the target. LD-linked SNPs in the base were clumped by using HapMap_ceu_all genotype as the reference (release 22, 60 individuals, 3.96 million SNPs), with the parameter settings recommended in PRSice; a clumping threshold of p1 = p2 = 0.5, an LD threshold of r 2 = 0.05 and a distance threshold of 300 kb. Independent SNPs were grouped into different quantiles with gradually increasing P thresholds (PT). The PT of the quantile that explained most variance of the target was defined as the best-fitted PT.<SEP>Independent genome-wide significant SNPs (P < 5 × 10−8 from each locus) for general IgM and CLL were identified in our discovery GWAS meta-analysis of IgM anti-PC. For each identified SNP, the effect sizes on general IgM, CLL versus IgM anti-PC were plotted in scatter plots by using GTX package in R 3.4.1.<SEP>Functional prediction<SEP>Correlated SNPs (r 2 > 0.10) within the LD block of the top finding were submitted to UCSC Genome Browser (GRCh37/hg19), to study marks of potential regulation (including transcription, histone modification, DNase hypersensitivity and TFs binding) determined by ENCODE on cell lines. Annotation database RegulomeDB with established and predicted regulatory elements in the intergenic regions of the Homo sapiens was used for searching evidence of TF binding. In order to identify the binding sites for potential TFs, 728bp of the DNA sequence surrounding the indicated functional variant was submitted to FIMO, a tool enabling searches of motifs derived from ChIP-seq and SELEX data.<SEP>Nested case–control study<SEP>The nested case–control study was designed to follow-up on the results of the GWAS meta-analysis indicating the top genetic variant shared between IgM anti-PC and CLL. We evaluate the phenotypic association between IgM anti-PC and CLL in the Swedish Twin Registry serum biobank, which contains serum samples of over 12 000 participants who have been linked to the Swedish National Patient Registry. By using international classification of diseases (ICDs) codes (ICD10: C91.1; ICD7/8/9: 204.1), all cases of CLL in the biobank were identified; 7 prevalent (onset before sampling) and 23 incident CLL cases (onset after blood sampling) were found, and three age- (birthdates were within 690 days and the same age at blood sampling) and sex-matched controls were also randomly selected for each case. For the 30 CLL cases and the 90 matched controls, serum samples were withdrawn and IgM anti-PC levels were measured according to the same manufacturer’s protocol (CVDefine® , Athera Biotechnologies AB) as used for the anti-PC GWAS. Measurements were calibrated by using a six-point calibrators curve containing IgM anti-PC levels ranging from 0 to 100U/ml. Raw values and rank order normalized values of IgM anti-PC were used in the t-test and stratified Cox proportional hazards models.<SEP>Web resources<SEP>PLINK, http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/;<SEP>METAL, http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/METAL;<SEP>qqman, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qqman/;<SEP>LocusZoom, http://locuszoom.sph.umich.edu/locuszoom/;<SEP>1000 Genomes Project, http://www.1000genomes.org/;<SEP>InterLymph consortium, http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/InterLymph/;<SEP>Metaphor, http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php;<SEP>PRSice: http://prsice.info/;<SEP>UCSC Genome Browser, https://genome.ucsc.edu/;<SEP>Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE): https://www.encodeproject.org/;<SEP>Ensembl, http://www.ensembl.org/index.html;<SEP>RegulomeDB, http://regulome.stanford.edu/index;<SEP>Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO), http://meme-suite.org/tools/fimo;<SEP>STRING database, http://string-db.org/;<SEP>GTX: Genetics ToolboX, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtx/.<SEP>All websites were last accessed on 22 March 2018.","Results<SEP>GWAS meta-analysis of IgM anti-PC<SEP>After phenotype and genotype matching, individuals with both IgM anti-PC measurements and genotypes available were used in this study (Table 1). Among the three individual discovery GWAS of IgM anti-PC, one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs74420772 in 3p14.1 achieved genome-wide significance in TwinGene (P = 2.7 × 10−8), whereas no genome-wide significant SNPs were observed in the other two studies (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). In the discovery phase meta-analysis of these three GWAS results (total n = 3002), two SNPs in 1p31.3 and six SNPs in 11q24.1 achieved genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 × 10™8, Fig. 1A; Supplementary Material, Table S1), with negligible inflation of the signal from population stratification or other sources, lambda (λ) = 1.001 (Fig. 1B). Validation of the eight associated SNPs from the discovery GWAS meta-analysis was sought in the fourth cohort (n = 646). The two SNPs in 1p31.3 were not significant (P ≥ 0.164), but all of the six SNPs in 11q24.1 were successfully replicated (P < 6.5×10−3, Supplementary Material, Table S2). On the basis of all four studies, the allelic effect size (β) of the leading SNP rs35923643-G in 11q24.1 was 0.19 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13–0.24, P =4.3 × 10−11] rank order normalized standard deviation (SD) of IgM anti-PC per allele (Table 2; Supplementary Material, Table S3). These six SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) within a 131 kb block that overlaps with the GRAM domain containing 1B (GRAMD1B) gene (Fig. 1C). The mean levels of IgM anti-PC in the genotype groups of rs35923643 (and its proxy SNP rs735665) are presented in Supplementary Material, Table S4.<SEP>Polygenic risk score analysis<SEP>The allele rs35923643-G (or its proxy SNP rs735665-A, r 2 = 1, D′ = 1) has also been recognized as the top risk allele for CLL, as judged by the latest meta-analysis of six GWASs of CLL. In the latest GWAS of general immunoglobulin levels, rs735665-A was also found to be a main genetic variant specific for general IgM, rather than general IgA and general IgG. The shared genetic variants were investigated in polygenic risk score (PRS) and correlation analyses by using the summary GWAS results of IgM anti-PC (from our discovery meta-analysis), IgM [SNPs with association P < 1×10−6 from Jonsson et al. ] and CLL [from the InterLymph consortium ].<SEP>PRSs on the basis of general IgM increasing alleles were positively associated with IgM anti-PC, with β close to 0.5 and P < 5 × 10−6 across all tested P-value threshold quantiles (Fig. 2A). Eight of the nine genome-wide significant SNPs for general IgM were identified in our IgM anti-PC GWAS, in which rs2476601 (P = 0.007) and rs735665 (P = 3.1 × 10−8) achieved nominal significance (Fig. 2B).<SEP>PRSs on the basis of IgM anti-PC increasing alleles were associated with higher risk of CLL. Across the 5000 quantiles including genome-wide SNPs with gradually increasing association P-value with IgM anti-PC, the quantile only including the SNP rs735665 was best-fitted and explained the largest variance of CLL (Nagelkerke r 2 = 0.006, P = 1.2×1015, Fig. 2C). All of the 33 independent genome-wide significant SNPs for CLL were identified in our IgM anti-PC GWAS, in which rs9392504 (P = 0.04) and rs735665 (P = 3.1 × 10−8) achieved nominal significance (Fig. 2D).<SEP>PRSs on the basis of increasing alleles for general IgM (across quantiles with gradually increasing threshold for association P-value, from P < 5.0 × 10−10 to P < 1.0 × 10−6) were associated with lower risk of CLL (Supplementary Material, Table S5). There were 43 independent SNPs (association P-values with general IgM was lower than 5.0 × 10−8) in the best-fitted quantile, explaining 0.003 of the variance of CLL risk with an odds ratio of 0.69 (95% CI 0.55–0.83, P = 4.2 × 10−8).<SEP>Functional prediction<SEP>The potential function of the variants in the top locus 11q24.1 shared between IgM anti-PC and CLL is not known. The LD block that rs35923643 located was scanned for regulatory marks in leukemia- or immune-cell lines (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). Peaks of histone mark monomethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4Me1) (in GM12878) and deoxyribonuclease I (DNaseI) hypersensitivity (in GM12878, CD34+ and GM12865) were found at the position of rs35923643 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3A and B).<SEP>In the chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), there were suggested binding sites for 22 different transcription factors (TFs) within the ~700bp region around rs35923643 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3C). Among the matched sequences from Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO) tool, the strongest signals were observed for Runt-related TF 3 (RUNX3) and SPI1 (Supplementary Material, Table S6). The RUNX3 binding motifs include the SNP rs35923643 (at the position of 391 bp), in which Haib_RUNX3_GM12878_Motif1_ fw_ic0 was from a B-cell line. Switching from the major allele T/A at rs35923643 to the minor C/G allele impeded the predicted binding affinity of RUNX3, making the P-value (defined as probability of match for a random sequence with the same length) to increase 10-fold (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3D).<SEP>The RegulomeDB database also gave support for rs35923643 to affect the binding of TFs in general (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Taken together, the results indicate that rs35923643 may be a more likely candidate to be the functional variant rather than rs735665 that has been frequently reported for CLL.<SEP>Phenotypic association between IgM anti-PC and CLL<SEP>In a small nested case–control study (7 prevalent CLL cases, 23 incident CLL cases, with 3 age- and sex-matched controls for each case), we found IgM anti-PC to be lower in prevalent CLL cases than in matched controls (P = 0.006); although it was not different between incident CLL cases and their matched controls (P = 0.227, Table 3). No association between IgM anti-PC and incident CLL risk estimated from the stratified Cox proportional hazards model (P = 0.354). Moreover, we tested whether the difference of IgM anti-PC levels between CLL cases and the matched controls was dependent on the time between sampling and diagnosis. There was a declining but not statistically significant trend (β = –0.08, P = 0.10, Fig. 3; Supplementary Material, Fig. S5).","Discussion<SEP>In summary, we show that the same top variant in 11q24.1 is shared between serum level of IgM anti-PC and CLL risk; and that rs35923643-G constitutes a more likely functional variant than rs735665 because it might impede the binding of tumor suppressor RUNX3. Even though PRS on the basis of increasing alleles of IgM anti-PC associated with higher risk of CLL, and the top variant contributes most to this, we saw an inverse relationship between IgM anti-PC and CLL at the phenotypic level.<SEP>The allele rs35923643-G shared between IgM anti-PC and CLL could reflect shared influences between susceptibility to initiate a B-cell malignant process and IgM anti-PC level, or it might be due to interactions with other factors such as infections. Serum level of IgM anti-PC is very low or undetectable in newborns, and it is lower in Swedish as compared with Kitavan people who are exposed to considerable more microorganisms. Among 10 types of respiratory tract infections, only pneumonia has been reported to be associated with increased CLL risk. Because PC is an epitope on S. pneumoniae, the production of IgM anti-PC might also be triggered by such infection.<SEP>The phenotypic correlation between general IgM and IgM anti-PC is not established in the literature, but our PRS and SNP effect size correlation analyses (Fig. 2A and B) indicate that they are expected to be markedly correlated. This is of course not surprising given that IgM anti-PC is a sub-fraction of general IgM. Because IgM anti-PC has been put forth as a promising bio-marker for autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases, it has been measured in several cohorts in Sweden. However, similar data for general IgM are not available in these materials, we were unable to investigate the genetic underpinnings of IgM anti-PC after adjustment for level of general IgM. We believe that such analysis is worth perusing because it might reveal other specific signals.<SEP>In the PRS analysis, the explained variance of CLL becomes reduced when including more SNPs with higher P-threshold in the quantiles (Fig. 2C), potentially because of the lack of power with the small sample size of our IgM anti-PC GWAS. However, the PRSs on the basis of general IgM increasing alleles are associated with lower risk of CLL throughout the tested P-thresholds (Supplementary Material, Table S5). The difference between these results may reflect that for general IgM, only the subset of 5934 SNPs with association P-value < 1.0 × 10−6 were available for analysis (the full summary statistics have not been published); or it might indicate actual differences in the associations to CLL between general IgM and IgM anti-PC. Therefore, the pleiotropic effects and shared genetics between general IgM, IgM anti-PC and CLL are worth to be further investigated by Mendelian randomization-Egger and LD score regression in studies with larger sample size.<SEP>The allele frequency of the proxy SNP rs735665-A is very different among ethnic groups (Supplementary Material, Fig. S6): 1%–2% in African and East Asian people, but 14%–22% in South Asian, European and American populations. We note that these differences coincide with CLL being one of the most common forms of leukemia in western countries, whereas rare in East Asia and Middle East, but the significance of these observations remains to be further investigated.<SEP>The GRAMD1B gene close to rs735665 and rs35923643 in 11q24.1 is highly conserved and mainly expressed in nervous-(brain) and immune-tissues (RNA-seq from GTEx Portal), but its function has not been well characterized. GRAM domain is an intracellular protein- or lipids-binding signaling domain, which exists in several membrane-associated proteins such as glucosyltransferase, myotubularin and GRAMD1B protein. Recently, GRAMD1B was reported to be involved in chemo-resistance and used as potential target to treat ovarian cancer.<SEP>Chromatin structure and epigenetic programming play important roles in the maturation of B-cells and development of CLL. Our functional prediction suggests that the variant rs35923643 (in very high LD with rs735665) may constitute a functional variant that influence regulatory pathways in leukemia- or immune-cells. We found peaks of histone mark H3K4Me1 and DNaseI hypersensitivity at the position of rs35923643 in B-lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells, which indicate that chromatin at this position can be highly remodeled for transcriptional regulation. TF binding site screening by FIMO suggested that variation at rs35923643 could influence the binding of RUNX3.<SEP>RUNX3 is a TF with 429 amino acids that binds to the core site 5′-PYGPYGGT-3′, which presents in several enhancers and promoters. It acts as a tumor suppressor and may influence cancer development through its central role in immunity. The interaction network output from STRING database indicates that functional partners of RUNX3 include core-binding factor β subunit, SMAD family 3/4 and ubiquitin C (Supplementary Material, Fig. S7), which are important components in networks and pathways of macromolecule metabolic processes, stem cell differentiation, cell cycle and protein phosphorylation (Supplementary Material, Fig. S8). The RUNX3 gene is a common site for somatic disruption and translocations in lymphoid malignancies, and it is usually expressed in proliferating B cells. Despite several indications, we realize that the mechanistic significance of our TF binding results admittedly is speculative. Validation of the involvement of RUNX3 binding affinity to the top genetic variant is needed from alternative analyses (e.g. other in silico approaches or allele specific ChIP-seq experiments).<SEP>The inverse phenotypic association between IgM anti-PC and CLL is opposite to what the identified shared genetic variant suggests (rs35923643-G is associated with increases in both IgM anti-PC and CLL risk). We note that the situation with alleles exerting opposite effects for different but related trait is a phenomenon increasingly seen in the immune-mediated diseases. With the limited sample size in the nested case–control study, we of course cannot rule out association because of chance. However, the low level of IgM anti-PC in cases with CLL may be due to a general disease-related hypoglobulinemia that presents some time before or after CLL manifests. In prevalent CLL cases, the affected B cells might have stopped producing immunoglobulin as a consequence of the CLL or treatment, i.e. reverse causation. We found the IgM anti-PC level to be lower also in incident CLL cases, even though the relationship was not statistically significant. Our nested case–control study was limited to serum samples from elderly subjects, which may accentuate the observed inverse phenotypic association. Other limitations are that we lack duplicate measurements, detailed clinical information about stage, therapy, immunoglobulin heavy chain and stereotyped B-cell status.<SEP>Because of the generally old age of onset, hypoglobulinemia and immunosuppressive treatments, 30%–50% of CLL patients die from infections. Therefore, immunoglobulin antimicrobial prophylaxis and different types of vaccines (e.g. influenza and pneumococcal vaccines) have been recommended to reduce mortality from infections in CLL patients. The potential predictive and preventive value of IgM anti-PC in CLL development also deserves more investigation in the future.<SEP>This is the first GWAS of IgM anti-PC, and more findings would be expected with increasing sample sizes in the future. Even so, we think that the robustness of the GWAS result combined with the overlap with genetic susceptibility to CLL indicates that the top locus in 11q24.1 likely harbors variants with joint effects on IgM anti-PC and CLL.",25337,['FOODAL']
