Among the dangerous and life-threatening consequences of atherosclerosis are ischemic heart disease and stroke that can develop when the disease affects the arteries feeding the heart and the brain correspondingly. Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease, which can remain asymptomatic during a long period of time. With the development of non-invasive diagnostic methods and accumulation of knowledge from post-mortem studies, it became clear that the disease begins at a much younger age than previously thought and can be present in young people without clinical manifestation. Therefore, better understanding of the disease pathogenesis at the early stages is crucial for the development of effective therapies. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis includes many known factors, such as alterations of lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, changes in the immune system functioning, and decreased tissue response to injury. Accumulating evidence reveals that atherosclerosis shares some pathophysiological mechanisms with other chronic human diseases, including cancers and neurological disorders. Most of the existing therapeutic approaches are limited to alleviating atherosclerosis symptoms and slowing down their progression but offer little help against plaque development initiation. Despite the advances in our understanding of atherosclerosis mechanisms, several important questions remain unanswered. One of them is the origin of local, or even focal distribution of atherosclerotic lesions in the arterial wall. Macroscopic examination of post-mortem aortic wall specimens allows distinguishing areas, unaffected by atherosclerosis or developing diffuse intimal thickening, and areas containing atherosclerotic plaques at different development stages. Microscopic study of such samples demonstrated that atherosclerotic plaque development may possibly be explained by the course of local inflammatory response. In some areas, tissue repair occurs rapidly after the inflammation is resolved, leading to diffuse intimal thickening. However, in atherosclerosis-prone areas, the inflammatory response can become chronic, which results in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. One of the possible explanations of such irregularity of local immune response is presence of cells affected by mitochondrial dysfunction that have altered metabolism and are subject to oxidative stress. Mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles that have evolved as a result of endosymbiosis. This organelle plays a key role in cell survival and death, because serves as a main source of cellular energy through respiration. Moreover, mitochondria participate in regulating cellular metabolism and ion balance and play important signaling functions. The mitochondrion has its own DNA (mtDNA) in a form of circular chromosome, which encodes the majority of (but not all) proteins necessary for respiratory chain functioning. Besides energy production, mitochondrial respiratory chain also generates significant amounts of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products, serving as an important intracellular source of these reactive agents. Levels of mitochondrial ROS depends on the respiratory activity, metabolism level, and correct functioning of the mitochondria. While low levels of ROS have important signaling functions, elevated ROS can have damaging effect on the surrounding cellular structures, altering DNA, proteins, and other molecules. The mtDNA, which is located close to the mitochondrial membranes where the reactions take place, is exposed to elevated ROS levels. Although questionable, such exposure is generally believed to be one of the possible explanations of increased mutagenesis rate in the mtDNA as compared to genomic DNA. Other explanations include the higher rate of errors made by mtDNA replication machinery and less reliable DNA repair system than that of genomic DNA. MtDNA mutations are can be homoplasmic or heteroplasmic depending on whether the mutated gene is present in all mtDNA copies within a cell or only in part of them. Deleterious mtDNA mutations can result in respiratory chain dysfunction, with reduced energy and increased ROS production. Moreover, deletions in the mtDNA can trigger its compensatory overproliferation (increase of copy number). Together, these processes may lead to further increase of ROS, forming a vicious circle, which can lead to cell death and damage of surrounding tissue, thus creating local pro-inflammatory conditions. Certain mtDNA mutations can cause severe mitochondrial diseases (mitochondriopathies) that are inherited, while others can accumulate and contribute to disease development during lifetime. As mitochondria are inherited through the maternal line, so do known inherited mitochondrial diseases, such as MIDD (maternally inherited diabetes and deafness) or MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). Although these conditions are associated with increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular events, their link to atherosclerosis remains elusive. Because mitochondrial inheritance is asexual and not accompanied by genetic recombination, it is subject to “Muller’s ratchet” effect, the irreversible accumulation of mutations. This effect is likely to be more pronounced for mtDNA than genomic DNA which undergoes recombination. However, genetic bottlenecks for mtDNA during mammalian embryonic development have been described that consist of replication of a certain mtDNA subpopulation or reduction of copy number. Mutagenesis in mtDNA and accumulation of mtDNA mutations occurs during lifetime in different parts of the body, and this process can be enhanced by external factors, such as smoking or infections. The list of mtDNA mutations involved in human diseases is growing, despite the methodological challenges of mitochondrial mutation research. Since mitochondrial dysfunction can be compensated at different levels, functional analysis of mtDNA mutations requires creating cellular and animal models that allow demonstrating the effect of the studied mutation. In particular, cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids) are powerful modern tools that are used to classify and study mtDNA mutations. Cybrid models make it possible to investigate functional significance of mtDNA mutations in a given cell type. Therefore, mitochondria can be regarded as disease-modifying agents in chronic disorders. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the reasons for phenotypic differences of individuals, tissues, and cells. Restoration of mitochondrial function using different strategies is considered as attractive therapeutic approach, and such strategies are being actively developed. 2. Risk Factors of Atherosclerosis: Oxidative Stress and LDL Modification Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the generation of ROS or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and the ability of the organism to neutralize them with endogenous antioxidant systems. ROS include superoxide (O2•), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (•OH), while RNS-nitroxyl anion (NO−), nitrosonium cation (NO+), nitrate (NO3−) and S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). Both ROS and RNS play important physiological roles, being involved in cell signaling, modulation of transcriptional factors, and apoptosis. Mitochondrial production of ROS is therefore tightly controlled under normal conditions. Weakening of such control, increased production of ROS/RNS or inadequate functioning of antioxidant systems lead to mitochondrial oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress was shown to be associated with various human diseases, including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic inflammation, and cardiovascular disorders. It was also shown to be a significant element in atherosclerosis pathogenesis. Moreover, major known risk factors of atherosclerosis, including dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension are all associated with increased production of ROS. Many various enzymes are involved in oxidative stress development in the vascular system, for example, NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and an endothelial NO synthase. However, the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes are among the most potent producers. Mitochondrial oxidative stress can exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction by damaging mtDNA and organelle structures therefore forming a vicious cycle. In atherosclerosis, deficiency of antioxidant systems can promote disease progression through oxidative stress. For instance, these processes were observed in atherosclerosis models, such as apoe −/− atherosclerotic mice deficient for superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2). Under normal conditions, mitochondrial antioxidant and repair systems are able to counterbalance the deleterious effects of excessive ROS. Moreover, if part of mtDNA pool and organelle structures are damaged, they can be recycled through the process of mitochondrial turnover. Within the cell, mitochondria undergo cycles of fission and fusion, known as mitochondrial turnover, which maintains a pool of functional organelles that corresponds to the cell’s energy needs. Excessive or damaged parts of the mitochondria are fragmented to smaller structures that can later be recycled through mitophagy, a specialized type of autophagy. These processes are executed by a set of specialized proteins, which mutations are known to block the mitochondrial turnover and cause mitochondrial disorders (Figure 1). The existing balance between fission and fusion is necessary for effective mitochondrial turnover inside the cell, maintaining a functional population of these organelles that corresponds to energy expenditure. Fusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane is regulated by a dynamin protein Opa1 (Optic Atrophy 1). In cells with relatively low energy needs, mitochondrial size is usually smaller than in cells characterized by high energy consumption and active metabolism. Disturbance of mitophagy results in accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional organelles that can act as ROS producers and can be dangerous to the cell. Mitophagy is initiated through activation of P-TEN-induced kinase (PINK1), which is located at the external mitochondrial membrane, and a ubiquitin ligase PARKIN. These proteins can respond to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Suppression of autophagy in macrophages was shown to promote atherosclerosis development in mice that were kept on a high-fat diet or in low-density lipoprotein-deficient animals (ldlr−/− mice). Inhibition of autophagy in these models was shown to be promoted by local inflammation, decreased efferocytosis, and reduced autophagic competence. Experiments on murine macrophages have demonstrated that stimulation of mitophagy inhibited pyroptosis induced by oxidized LDL. Therefore, accumulating evidence indicates that mitochondrial turnover and mitophagy are important protective mechanisms that may reduce the risk of mitochondrial dysfunction and associated disorders. The role of mitophagy in the correct functioning of the innate immune system is currently widely recognized. Future studies should identify and characterize the factors regulating mitochondrial turnover and the pathologic features associated with its dysfunction. Correction of these features may provide interesting possibilities for treatment of the disease at early stages. Mitochondrial metabolic activity can change in response to cellular energy demands and external signals. However, such plasticity can also contribute to pathology development, as was shown for carcinogenesis, often associated with mitochondrial metabolic switch to glycolysis even while oxygen is present (Warburg effect). More recent studies demonstrated a crucial role of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in this effect, since pharmacological or genetic inhibition of this pathway reduced proliferation of several cancer lines. A tight link was demonstrated between PPP activity, ROS generation, and autophagy, that may help explaining the mechanisms of cancer cells proliferation. In response to ROS elevation, cancer cells can turn from glycolysis to PPP; however, sustained oxidative stress can inhibit this pathway through glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibition and increase autophagy. The existence of similar link in atherosclerosis development remains to be demonstrated. Besides the energy production, mitochondria also serve as important controllers of the cell fate, hence the choice between cell survival and death. Triggering of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway includes permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane through damage or opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pore. That leads to dissipation of the proton gradient across the membrane and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, disrupting the energy production. Furthermore, water can enter the mitochondrial matrix through the open PT pore, which results in swelling of the intermembrane space, outer membrane rupture, and release of apoptosis-triggering factors into the cytoplasm. Among such factors are cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and endonuclease G that initiate the apoptotic cascade through caspase activation. Under normal conditions, apoptotic cells are cleared from the tissue by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, which prevent inflammation and tissue damage. Phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane serves as a marker of apoptotic cells, which is also widely used in in vitro experiments. The integrity of the mitochondrial membranes is also necessary for their proper functioning as important regulators of Ca2+ homeostasis within the cell. Mitochondria serve as cellular Ca2+ reservoir alongside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with which they form special type of contacts (mitochondrial-associated ER membranes, of MAMs). Thus, they actively participate in intracellular Ca2+ signaling, which regulates multiple cellular processes, including autophagy. This aspect of mitochondrial functioning appears to be interesting to study in the context of atherosclerosis, since Ca2+ homeostasis disturbance is important for plaque calcification and formation of unstable lesions. The role of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis has been described in several reviews. The involvement of oxidative stress in atherogenesis is highlighted by the important role that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) play in this process. Circulating LDL particles are exposed to various physical and chemical alterations in the blood flow. These changes can affect the lipid, protein and carbohydrate moieties of the lipoprotein particle. The earliest process in this modification chain appears to be desialylation, the removal of the terminal sialic acid residues from glycan chains. Desialylation is followed by other modifications, accompanied by particle size reduction, density increase and acquisition of electric charge. The resulting small dense LDL (sdLDL) is characterized by reduced content of antioxidants, and is therefore subject to oxidation. Moreover, modified LDL particles have prolonged residence time in the arterial wall, where oxidation is facilitated, because of their interaction with tissue components, such as glycans. Atherogenic LDL accumulates in sites of the arterial wall, which are prone to atherosclerosis. Inflammatory reaction initiated at such sites can be at least partially explained by stimulation of LDL particle phagocytosis with subsequent cytokine release and the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Modified LDL can also induce endothelial dysfunction, which is considered as an early marker of atherosclerosis, as demonstrated in the J774A.1 murine macrophage cell line. MtDNA-depleted (rho0) cells appeared to be resistant to caspase-1-dependent cell death associated with DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) release. Further studies should investigate the effects of modified LDL uptake on mitochondrial function. Intracellular lipid accumulation in the arterial wall occurs in different cell types. Both recruited (such as macrophages) and resident (such as modified smooth muscle cells) arterial wall cells are able to internalize modified LDL and transform to lipid-rich foam cells. Moreover, foam cells continue to produce pro-inflammatory mediators, supporting the inflammatory response. These processes lead to neointima formation through hyperplasia, migration, and proliferation of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. By contrast, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apoA-I, and endogenous apoE are protective against inflammation and oxidative stress. Moreover, these molecules also promote cholesterol efflux, which helps slowing down lipid accumulation and therefore atherosclerotic lesion formation. More broadly, apolipoprotein balance can be regarded as a potent regulator of the immune system. Mice lacking apoe and ldlr are widely used atherosclerosis models. It was shown that presence of apoe (apoeh/h, ldlr−/−) resulted in reduced plaque formation as compared to (apoe−/−, ldlr−/−) animals, with markedly reduced numbers of circulating leukocytes and pro-inflammatory monocytes. This was associated with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory molecules by both immune and endothelial cells. Later studies consolidated our knowledge of apolipoproteins as important immune system modulators. 3. Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Inflammation Accumulating evidence positions mitochondria as a key player in the development of the inflammatory response and in the maintenance of chronic inflammation. Numerous human pathologies that are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis are also characterized by chronic inflammation. Atherosclerosis, in particular, is currently regarded as chronic inflammatory disorder, and the mechanisms of the inflammatory component of the disease are being actively studied. Modified LDL can trigger the production of autoantibodies followed by formation of circulating LDL-containing immune complexes that are highly atherogenic and pro-inflammatory. Furthermore, it was shown that presence of modified LDL (such as oxLDL) stimulates phagocytosis in macrophages, therefore promoting their pro-inflammatory activation. Such engulfment of large quantities of lipids leads to formation of cholesterol crystals in lipid-accumulating cells, which is another potent mechanism of inflammatory activation. In growing atherosclerotic plaques, pro-inflammatory environment is maintained by elevated production of various cytokines and chemokines by activated cells, which had been reviewed elsewhere. The role of the mitochondria in inflammation became a subject of numerous reviews. Moreover, age-associated decline of the mitochondrial function linked to the progression of chronic age-associated inflammatory disorders are now embraced in the concept of “inflammaging” that may improve our understanding and help develop refined treatment approaches, such as targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress. One of the well-known pro-inflammatory features of mitochondrial dysfunction is increased mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative stress. Moreover, mitochondria are responsible for metabolic regulation of the immune cells, including macrophages, through Krebs cycle modulation. Mitochondrial damage can lead to the release of mtDNA, which is a potent DAMP recognized by the immune cells that can trigger the inflammatory response. In response to DAMP, the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome is triggered, which results in potent downstream pro-inflammatory signaling. Later studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial damage can promote the NLRP3 activation directly, through the release of mtDNA, potassium ions efflux, and ROS generation and also serving as a special site of inflammasome assembly. However, the role of mitochondria in the immune system regulation is much more complex than mere pro-inflammatory signaling. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of the mitochondria in regulation of immune system homeostasis and tissue regeneration through distinct signaling pathways, such as Wnt pathway and TGFβ signaling, as reviewed elsewhere. The above listed pathways can be more or less active depending on the environment and the tissue type and are being especially actively studied in cancer, although can be relevant for other human pathologies. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator 1 (PGC-1) family proteins that are involved in the regulation of many cellular metabolic pathways were also shown to control mitochondrial metabolism. PGC-1α has been identified as a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis through transcriptional activation of nuclear respiratory factor (NRF) 1/2. This signaling pathway leads to activation of mitochondrial biogenesis through the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which binds mtDNA, regulating its stability, replication, and transcription. The prominent role of PGC-1 proteins in the regulation of immune system is currently well known and was shown to be largely dependent on mitochondrial regulation. For instance, in macrophages, PGC-1α promotes alternative activation, thus alleviating the inflammatory response, through positive regulation of antioxidant genes and ROS reduction, while PGC-1β overexpression promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and reduces the proinflammatory cytokine generation. Correction of mitochondrial dysfunction was shown to have protective anti-inflammatory effects. Signaling pathways regulating mitochondrial function are currently being investigated as potential points of therapeutic intervention for treatment of various diseases, including atherosclerosis. For instance, upregulation of PGC-1α was shown to be protective against atherosclerotic lesion development. Mitophagy was found to have a potent effect inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation, with potential therapeutic significance. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), mitophagy was shown to protect from apoptosis induced by pro-atherogenic modified LDL or autophagy deficiency. Such protective effect is likely to alleviate the inflammatory condition in atherosclerotic plaque. In summary, mitochondrial dysfunction appears to be a key player in pro-inflammatory response and chronic inflammation in the arterial wall, which ultimately leads to atherosclerosis progression. Presence of distinct cells with dysfunctional mitochondria within the endothelial layer of the arteries may provide for an explanation of the focal distribution of atherosclerotic lesions observed on ex-vivo samples. Exposure to circulating atherogenic LDL leads to lipid uptake by phagocytic cells of the arterial wall triggering an inflammatory response. However, in case of the intact mitochondrial function, this inflammation can be effectively resolved, followed by tissue repair and the formation of so called diffuse intimal thickening. By contrast, mitochondrial dysfunction in such cells (caused by mtDNA mutations, ROS elevation, and associated damage or deficient mitochondrial turnover) leads to continuous release of pro-inflammatory factors and perpetuation of the inflammatory process. In the sites where such cells are present, the inflammatory environment persists, tissue repair is deficient, and advanced atherosclerotic plaque is more likely to develop (Figure 2). 4. mtDNA Mutations in Atherosclerosis and Related Pathologies In many cases, mitochondrial dysfunction is caused by mtDNA mutations. Since mtDNA is present in several copies within the cell, mtDNA mutations can be homo- or heteroplasmic, and the latter are characterized by certain heteroplasmy level, at which phenotypic effects of the mutation become apparent. Both spontaneously acquired and inherited mtDNA mutations can contribute to human disease development, with MIDD and MELAS being examples of maternally inherited mitochondrial diseases. The list of mtDNA variants implicated in human disease is constantly growing. Mitochondrial genome contains only 37 genes, but some of them encode the key enzyme complexes required for oxidative phosphorylation: complexes I, III, IV, and V. To explain why these vital genes have not been copied to the host cell genome, the CoRR (Colocation for redox regulation of gene expression) hypothesis was proposed, according to which, such location was important for direct regulation of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes in response to changes of the redox state. Apart from protein-coding genes, areas of mtDNA that are required for its replication (D-loop) and mitochondrial tRNA genes can be affected by mutagenesis with deleterious effects. Study of mtDNA mutations accumulating in different sections of the arterial wall samples obtained from deceased patients revealed a list of mtDNA variants associated with atherosclerosis (hence found in the areas affected by atherosclerotic lesions). Among them were m.3256C>T (tRNA-Leu1 gene) and m.12315G>A (tRNA-Leu gene) encoding for tRNAs, m.3336T>C (ND1 gene), m.5178C>A (ND2 gene), m.14459G>A (ND6), and m.13513G>A (ND5), all encoding for NADPH dehydrogenase subunits, and m.15059>A in the cytochrome B gene. Another study revealed that m.15927G>A mutation that affects mitochondrial threonine tRNA was associated with coronary heart disease. Numerous studies identified mtDNA mutations that accumulate with age, and some of them can possibly contribute to age-associated atherosclerosis development. Since multiple components of the respiratory chain are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, abnormalities of oxidative phosphorylation and excessive generation of ROS are among the frequent consequences of mtDNA mutations. Experiments with uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in vitro demonstrated that mutations m.del1562G, m.12315G>A, m.3256C>T, m.14459G>A, and m.13513G>A promoted proton leakage and oxygen consumption. As a result, ROS were produced in excessive amounts exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction. It was shown that m.14459G>A was associated with increased basal rate of oxygen consumption, while m.1555A>G and m.14846G>A with the opposite effect. Oxygen consumption rate associated with variants of mtDNA that lead to oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling was studied by means of treatment of cells with 4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone carbonyl cyanide (FCCP) and oligomycin A. FCCP intercepts protons and transports them via the internal mitochondrial membrane, passing the proton channel of complex 5. Oligomycin inhibits the proton channel, therefore abolishing ATP synthase F1 capacity to synthesize ATP. Potassium cyanide (KCN) suppresses cytochrome c oxidase and, thus, decreases electron transport in the respiratory chain. Treatment of cells with KCN and succinate resulted in the loss of effect of the abovementioned mutations on oxygen consumption. Several mtDNA mutations were found to correlate with pro-inflammatory activation of monocytes, including homoplasmic m.1811G>A (mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene) and m.9477G>A (cytochrome c oxidase gene) and heteroplasmic m.14459G>A (ND6 gene), m.1555A>G (mitochondrial 12S rRNA) and m.12315G>A. Several of these mutations were able to change the activation of monocyte-derived macrophages via mitochondrial dysfunction in atherosclerosis. Mutations m.1555A>G and m.14846G>A were shown to be responsible for FCCP-induced increase in oxygen consumption. The relationship between mitophagy abnormalities and mtDNA mutations has been studied by several research groups. Overall, mtDNA mutations compromising mitochondrial function were found to stimulate mitophagy, probably as compensatory mechanism to deactivate dysfunctional organelles. Studies on cybrid lines identified a spectrum of mtDNA mutations associated with enhanced mitophagy initiation. For the mutation m.13514A>G, it was shown that increased mitophagy was accompanied by inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and AMPK signaling, revealing more details on the mechanisms of increased mitophagy associated with mtDNA mutations. Our group has conducted numerous experiments in cybrid lines focusing on atherosclerosis-related mtDNA mutations (detected in atherosclerotic patients). Several such mutations were shown to be associated with increased mitophagy, as assessed by LAMP expression: m.3336T>C, m.3256C>T, m.5178C>A, and m.5178C>A. 5. The Role of Mitochondria in Different Cell Types 5.1. Endothelial Cells Endothelial cells (ECs) form the lining of blood vessels separating the vascular wall from circulating blood. The key functions of the ECs are to support vessel homeostasis, regulate vascular wall permeability and provide cellular transport. Moreover, ECs take part in the inflammatory response in the arterial wall. Activation of the ECs in response to certain factors, such as signaling molecules, injury or changes of the laminar blood flow leads to increased production of cytokines and adhesion molecules. Among the cytokines known to be produced by activated ECs are interleukin (IL)-3, IL-7, IL-8, IL-11, IL-14, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Consequently, circulating immune cells can migrate to the site of cell activation and penetrate into the vessel wall. There is a phenotypical and morphological variety of ECs within the arterial wall endothelium, which may also reflect deviations of the endothelial function. In the ECs, only 2–6% of the cytoplasm volume is occupied by mitochondria, which appears to be low in comparison to other cell types with higher metabolic activity levels. Mitochondrial morphological changes in the ECs were shown to be associated with alteration of mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. High expression of Drp1, affecting mitochondrial turnover, in vascular endothelium can induce the pro-inflammatory factors, and further damage the vessels. Endothelial dysfunction-related proteins are iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), ICAM-1 (inter-cellular adhesion molecule 1) and vWF (von Willebrand factor). iNOS is one of the key enzymes generating nitric oxide (NO) from the amino acid l-arginine. ICAM-1 is a transmembrane protein, which is known to be up-regulated under inflammatory conditions in the ECs and epithelial cells. It mediates the adhesion of circulating immune cells and is considered as a marker of vascular EC activation or damage. Level of circulating vWF is increased following endothelial cell damage. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a risk factor for peripheral vascular disorders. Oxidative stress and activation of proinflammatory factors mediate the atherogenic effects of HHcy. It was shown that diabetes was associated with altered morphology of the mitochondria in the ECs, hepatocytes, and skeletal muscle, with increased mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced size and swelling. ECs take part in oxygen transport from the blood to underlying tissues and are therefore highly exposed to oxygen. Relatively low consumption of oxygen by the EC mitochondria provides for effective oxy-gen transport from the blood vessel and protects the surrounding tissues from oxidative stress. Mechanisms of rapid oxygen transport through the vessel endothelium are currently being investigated. Elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were shown in hypoxia, which can promote the biogenesis of mitochondria. Moreover, this process includes protein kinase B (Akt) signaling. Akt is a key protein kinase that regulates cell metabolism and orchestrates the signaling cascades promoting cell survival, motility, and cell cycle progression. In turn, Akt kinase is downstream of the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase signaling, which responds to insulin and other growth factors. Energy balance plays important regulatory function in angiogenesis driving blood vessel growth and branching. For instance, sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) is a highly conserved NAD+-dependent deacetylase, which is an important metabolic/energy sensor. Suppression of SIRT1 gene decreases biogenesis of mitochondria in the ECs, leading to reduction of vessel branching. Another important regulator of mitochondrial activity in the ECs is uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2), which is a mitochondrial anion carrier protein. UCP-2 facilitates anion transfer from the inner mitochondrial membrane and proton transfer of opposite direction, therefore reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential. 5.2. Macrophages Macrophages are key players of the innate immunity that respond to pathogen invasion and the appearance of dysfunctional and damaged cells by phagocytosis. Due to their phagocytic activity, macrophages actively participate in lipid accumulation in the arterial wall in atherosclerosis. Lipid uptake by macrophages goes via unspecific phagocytosis rather than specific receptor-mediated route, which leads to accumulation of undegraded cholesterol and lipids in the cytoplasm and foam cells formation. Pathogen detection and inflammatory response triggering is mediated by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that are expressed by the immune cells. These receptors identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that consist of components of the bacterial cell wall, nucleic acids, and proteins and induce classic activation of macrophages. However, PRRs also recognize the endogenous DAMPs that appear as a result of cellular damage, for example, free mtDNA, and urates. Inside the cell, the effectors and adaptors of PRRs are situated close to the mitochondrial membrane. After the activation of TLRs, conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathways (ECSIT) interacts with the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). The adaptor protein TRAF6 is involved in many protein-protein interactions through its TRAF domain and a newly identified (RING) finger domain, which is a zinc finger-type domain with non-conventional E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. ECSIT is also included in the mitochondrial respiratory complex I and contributes to mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) formation. Moreover, mtDNA promotes stimulation of NFκ-B and enables the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, which are responsible for the expression of such inflammatory mediations as TNF-α and IL-6. TNF-α is produced by macrophages in case of acute inflammation and participates in cellular signaling events, leading to necrosis or apoptosis. IL-6, in turn, has a pleiotropic effect on inflammation, immune response, and hematopoiesis. Production of mtROS also promotes stimulation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, which, in turn, triggers sterile inflammation. By contrast, NFκ-B can activate mitophagy that can decrease NLRP3-triggered inflammatory responses in macrophages. Moreover, NLRP3 inflammasomes increase the level of PFKFB3 according to IL-1β-dependent pathway and modulate glycolysis. Macrophage polarization in response to specific stimuli and signals is dependent on cellular metabolism and bioenergetic profile. Deregulation of this process contributes to different pathologies. Excessive pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages has damaging effects associated with uncontrolled inflammation. Persistence of pro-inflammatory activation leading to chronic inflammation is known to be associated with a number of chronic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Mechanisms limiting excessive pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages include signaling of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, therefore forming a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory polarization (M1 and M2 respectively). Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages produce large quantities of ROS, and this process is used not only to kill pathogens, but also to regulate cellular reactions. In M1 macrophages, iNOS contributes to NO production. M1 macrophages use mainly aerobic glycolysis for energy production, which is accompanied by a decrease of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and accumulation of succinate. Up-regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is one the reasons why M1 macrophages produce large quantities of ROS. PPP has a prominent antioxidative function through generation of NADPH. However, it also provides the precursors for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis necessary for growth. By contrast, M2 macrophages contribute to tissue repair and homeostasis. They are characterized by high arginase activity and production of ornithine, which promotes the tissue repair, and use glycolysis to produce fatty acids. Therefore, metabolism, which is dependent on correct mitochondrial functioning, has an important role in macrophage polarization. Immunometabolism became an attractive research topic and appears to be useful for developing new approaches for treatment of human inflammatory diseases.  It should be noted that the bipolar classification of M1 and M2 types of macrophages is simplified and outdated. Besides M1 and M2 macrophages, other types exist that take part in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. For example, Mox and Mhem macrophages differ in their response to oxidized phospholipids. The Mox cells regulate the redox status. Mhem macrophages, in turn, control iron metabolism in case of intraplaque hemorrhage. Moreover, macrophage populations can be different in humans and mice, further contributing to the variety. 5.3. Pericytes and Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells The wall of human blood vessel contains three layers: tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica adventitia. The intimal layer, in turn, consists of the endothelial cell lining, subendothelial layer, and internal elastic lamina. The subendothelial layer of large blood vessels contains two main resident cell types: VSMCs (approximately 50–60% of total amount of cells) and macrovascular pericytes (up to 30% of cells). Both of these cell types express smooth muscle α-actin, which is a marker of contractile, non-proliferative phenotype. However, functions of VSMCs and pericytes differ significantly. VSMCs are responsible for the coordination of physiologic processes required for homeostasis, for example, regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. Pericytes support blood vessel integrity and normal functioning of the endothelial lining, forming multiple connections with the ECs. These cells form a three-dimensional network being connected to each other and to the ECs and represent a second line of defense against pathogens under the endothelial lining. The supportive function of pericytes is illustrated by their role in the survival of ECs of retinal capillaries. Pericyte loss caused by exposure to superoxide in diabetic retina, where it is most studied, is associated with microaneurysms and appearance of acellular capillaries. Pericytes are characterized by contractile and synthetic activity but can also take part in phagocytosis and accumulation of LDL particles during atherosclerotic plaque development thus contributing to foam cell formation. Furthermore, pericytes, as dendritic cells, take part in antigen presentation and innate immune reactions. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is an important regulatory protein involved in oxidative stress response. PDGF was shown to protect neurons from H2O2-induced oxidative stress through PI3K-Akt and MAP kinase signaling pathway. In VSMCs, PDGF plays a key role in inducing phenotypic switching from contractile to proliferative state. The contractile phenotype has a low proliferation rate and reduced capacity for the formation of the extracellular matrix components, but produces contractile proteins smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, smooth muscle α-actin, and calponin. VSMCs of synthetic phenotype appear in case of vessel injury. They can proliferate and migrate towards the injury site. Moreover, they synthesize the extracellular matrix structural elements. Studies on retinal microvascular pericytes have long demonstrated that oxLDL has toxic effects on these cells, which are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. More recent studies have revealed that the increased phagocytic activity of vascular wall cells induced by modified LDL also involves macrovascular pericytes that reside in the subendothelial layer. In VSMCs, oxLDL can induce apoptosis, greatly contributing to the pro-inflammatory environment and the formation of unstable plaque. Interestingly, stimulation of mitophagy was shown to have a protective effect in dysfunctional VSMCs, indicating that stimulation of this process may help reducing the risk of unstable plaque development. 6. The Mitochondrion as a Potential Therapeutic Target The beneficial clinical effects of various drugs that are routinely used for treatment of diabetes and atherosclerosis appear to be conveyed, at least partially, by their anti-inflammatory effects. The study of pleiotropic effects and side effects of the common drugs is important for correcting and improving current therapeutic schemes. For instance, statins, which are widely used in patients with dyslipidemia, are also potent anti-inflammatory agents. However, statis were shown to interfere with mitochondrial pathways, inhibiting the respiratory chain and inducing mitochondrial apoptosis. The resulting increased oxidative stress and reduced energy production may explain some of the side effects of these drugs, as reviewed recently. Together these observations indicate that the effect of statins may be biphasic, with positive and negative effects dependent on the dose—a phenomenon known as hormesis, which has been demonstrated for various substances and biologic processes. It is therefore important to develop treatments that will allow alleviating the toxic side effects of statins on the mitochondria. Recently, cell-permeable succinate was shown to restore mitochondrial respiration in experimental cellular models of statin toxicity. These promising results may lead to improvement of statin therapy in the future. Metformin, a common anti-diabetic drug, is another example of medication with pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects. Direct anti-inflammatory activity of metformin was demonstrated, and its beneficial effect on the mitochondrial metabolism in immune cells was described recently. Statins, metformin, and other drugs used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, including polyphenols, were shown to modulate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a key cellular energy sensor. That is not surprising, since AMPK is situated at the crossroads of multiple signaling pathways regulating cellular metabolism. However, it is important to consider the crosstalk between AMPK signaling and mitochondrial function, which may appear to be relevant for therapy improvement. Currently, physical exercise is the most affordable and, at the same time, effective means of alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction in physically fit patients. Physical exercise has profound impact on cellular energy metabolism through AMPK signaling, which activates beta-oxidation of lipids, autophagy, and other processes to restore the energy homeostasis. The AMPK link was demonstrated between exercise and mitochondrial turnover with mitophagy activation, which helped refreshing the mitochondrial pool. The effect of exercise, such as that of statins, can be considered as hormetic, since it causes transient elevation of ROS stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and function (a process known as mitohormesis) but also improves mitophagy. The increasing incidence of cardiovascular disorders can be attributed, at least partially, to the lack of exercise, which stimulates mitochondrial function, resulting in anti-inflammatory effect. In combination with excessive food consumption and obesity, which is associated with chronic inflammation, lack of mitochondrial stimulation through exercise can lead to deleterious effects. Together, these observations highlight the important role that regular physical exercise can play in the prevention and treatment of conditions associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitochondrial turnover. This possibility is being actively explored and has already brought promising results for treatment of diabetes mellitus. The beneficial effect of regular exercise (either alone or in combination with therapy) on cardiovascular risk, as well as on obesity and diabetes indices, was demonstrated for diabetes patients in a controlled trial. It is also likely that regular exercise can potentiate the effect of commonly used medications. Development of treatment schemes taking these possibilities into account is an important future direction of atherosclerosis treatment. Another important metabolic regulator is the group of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), consisting of α, β, and γ isoforms. PPARs are transcription factors regulating multiple genes involved in glucose and lipoprotein metabolism and, correspondingly, mitochondrial function regulation. PPAR signaling is tightly linked to PGC-1α, which was identified as co-activator of PPARs in pathways increasing fatty acid oxidation. The PPARγ/PGC-1α signaling was shown to increase mitochondrial uncoupling and thermogenesis, being involved in the process of fat browning and response to exercise. PGC-1α also interacts with NRF1 and NRF2 stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis. These processes that appear to be important in the context of atherosclerosis development have been recently reviewed elsewhere. The effects of PPAR agonists currently used in clinical practice for treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, such as fibrates (mostly activating PPARα) or glitazones (mostly activating PPARγ) should be considered. Therapies directly targeting mitochondrial dysfunction are currently being actively developed. Such therapies appear to be promising for treatment of different chronic human diseases, including atherosclerosis. The growing list of such therapies includes mitochondrial antioxidants and mitochondrial dynamic modifiers. Antioxidant compounds are widely used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and other disorders and have also been tested for atherosclerosis. However, most of these agents failed to demonstrate efficacy for atherosclerosis in clinical trials. Possible reasons for the observed weak effect of antioxidants could be explained by their indirect action on the mitochondrial oxidative stress and limited applicability depending on the patient’s redox status and mitochondrial function. That highlights the need for specific mitochondrial antioxidants available for clinical use. Coenzyme Q10 and its analogues were found to be promising to treat conditions associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. However, more promising are specific mitochondrial antioxidants, such as mitoQ, which is able to associate with lipophilic molecules and, as a result, act on the mitochondria selectively. Other molecules of this group are superoxide dismutase mimetic agents EUK-8 and EUK-134. Furthermore, mitochondria-targeting quinones from SkQ family have been studied preclinically. These molecules have antioxidant properties reducing ROS formation and protecting cells from damage, as demonstrated in rat neurons. Photo-sensibilization can be used as a tool to treat various pathological conditions. A relatively new technique called photo-theranostics can cause selective apoptotic cell death in cells and tissues that are exposed to pathological alterations. Selective accumulation of photo-sensitizing substance in cellular components allows to target them selectively at sub-cellular level. Molecules that can be used for photo-theranostics in case of mitochondria have already been discovered. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is a well-known photosensitizer. This agent is generated in the mitochondria from a precursor, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). Application of exogenous 5-ALA leads to PpIX enrichment which depends on the cellular metabolic profile and is already used for treatment of some cancers. However, this approach is currently at the early development stage, and its clinical relevance is still unclear.",6624
34065857,"1. Introduction Cancer is a group of diseases characterised by uncontrolled abnormal cell growth. In 90–95%, cancer is caused by genetic mutations associated with environmental and lifestyle factors, while 5–10% is connected with inherited genetics. The activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes contributes to carcinogenesis. Various mutations are reported in well-characterised cancer genes but the whole process of carcinogenesis remains a mystery. The genome instability leads to cancer development by tumour angiogenesis, uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells which are resistant to death and avoid growth suppressors. Malignant cells can invade nearby tissue or metastasize and avoid the immune system. Furthermore, carcinogenesis leads to changes in energy metabolism of cells. Growing tumour cells produce a high level of lactate during aerobic glycolysis. Tumour mitochondria are characterised by an increased level of ROS, hypoxia and signals inhibiting apoptosis. Most of the mtDNA somatic mutations in tumours have been also reported as polymorphisms in the general population. MtDNA mutations occur in various diseases. They are a disorder associated especially with metabolism and energy. In this review, we focus on the changes in mitochondrial DNA associated with cancer (and other diseases), as well as on the function of mitochondria in human cells. 2. Mitochondrion as Organelle The mitochondrion is an organelle that, via cell oxidation processes, is a key energy converter in eukaryotic cells. The mitochondria synthesise adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an energy carrier used in various cellular processes, via the mitochondrial electron transport chain in the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The respiratory chain consists of four protein complexes located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Electrons are transported onto an oxygen molecule with the participation of the first four complexes. Complex I is called reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Q reductase), complex II is known as succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (SQR) and the third is ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex, while the fourth is called cytochrome c oxidase. Transport of reducing equivalents leads to proton gradient formation enabling ATP synthesis via activation of ATP synthase also known as complex V. The mitochondria are also engaged in nucleotide, amino acid and lipid metabolic pathways. Moreover, beta oxidation of fatty acids, the Krebs cycle, takes place in the mitochondrial matrix. The mitochondria participate in maintaining the cell calcium balance and regulate the cell’s redox potential by taking part in reactive oxygen species formation. When discussing the role of the mitochondria in carcinogenesis, it must be noted that they participate in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. 3. Mitochondrial DNA The mitochondrion is a semi-autonomous organelle with its own genome. It is not, however, completely independent of nuclear DNA (nDNA). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a circular, supercoiled molecule consisting of 16,569 base pairs and located in the mitochondrial matrix. It contains 37 genes without introns. They encode 13 polypeptides that create protein respiratory chain complexes, two rRNA molecules (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA) and 22 tRNA molecules. The remaining proteins are coded by nDNA. Mitochondrial DNA contains several ultra-short intergenic non-coding regions and one large region in the form of a D-loop consisting of 1122 base pairs. The D-loop encompasses nucleotides 16,024–16,569 and 1–576, takes part in mitochondrial genome replication and contains sequences that are promoters of genes coded by mtDNA. Two hypervariable regions (HVR) can be distinguished in its structure, HVRI and HVRII. The first complete sequence of the human mitochondrial genome was published in 1981 by Anderson et al.. Currently, the reference mtDNA sequence is the one updated in 1999, called the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence rCRS, which is available in the GenBank database under the accession number NC_012920. 4. Mitochondrial Haplogroups and Polymorphisms In humans, mitochondrial DNA is not inherited in accordance with the Mendel’s principles, but passed on to the next generation only in the maternal lineage without recombination. This hereditary difference and the frequency of mutations make mtDNA analysis a valuable tool in studies on the origins of contemporary people. The human mtDNA classification system consists of a network of haplogroups marked with capital Roman letters. Haplogroups are defined as groups of haplotypes with the same several polymorphisms. Characteristic mitochondrial mutations, which occurred in a given place and at a given time, were accumulated through maternal lineages during the migration of the human population and have led to the formation of haplogroups. This is the basis for the assessment of geographical distribution of populations and human migration. Genetic polymorphism occurs by way of an alteration in the DNA that is usually a result of cell adaptation to changing environmental conditions. The variation of genotypes is inherited from parents and occurs in all body cells. A polymorphism is present when the observed variability between individuals is not maintained by a recurrent mutation. The most frequent variability seen in the human genome is single nucleotide polymorphism SNP. The oldest mitochondrial group that gave rise to the next ones is haplogroup L0. It is typical for the Bushmen of South Africa and the Sandawe people of East Africa. Seven main mitochondrial groups have been distinguished based on mtDNA: L0, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, and L6. Haplogroup L3 gave rise to all mtDNA macro-haplogroups beyond Africa and is divided into two subclades, M and N. Group N is an ancestor of haplogroups R, X, I, W, A, S, O, and Y, while clade M produced haplogroups Q, E, G, D, C, and Z. Haplogroup R initiated nine other haplogroups H, U, K, J, T, V, F, B, and P. In Europe, the prevailing haplogroups are those descended from the macro-haplogroup N, H, U, K, J, T, V, X, I, and W. In Asia, however, the predominant haplogroups are A, S, O, and Y, which originate from the macro-haplogroup M. Within haplogroups, there are haplotypes, i.e., sets of polymorphisms that distinguish an individual from rCRS. The mtDNA rCRS sequence belongs to haplogroup H, which is the most common haplogroup in Europe. 5. Heteroplasmy and Homoplasmy of mtDNA Mitochondrial DNA is characterised by significantly greater occurrence of mutations than nDNA. This considerable susceptibility to chemical and physical factors is assumed to be associated with the lack of protective histones in its structure and, hence, increased exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that form in the respiratory chain. However, histones are also reported to be capable of promoting DNA damage under the influence of certain conditions and factors. MtDNA binds to a protein to form a complex known as a mitochondrial nucleoid. These proteins can protect and stabilize mtDNA. A eukaryotic cell contains usually identical copies of mtDNA, hence the term mtDNA homoplasmy. External factors may lead to mutations and formation of altered mtDNA. Such a cell contains both mutated and wild-type mtDNA. This situation is referred to as heteroplasmy. During mitotic division, mutated mtDNA is inherited by daughter cells in humans. This may result in the preponderance of mutated mtDNA over wild-type mtDNA, and entail a change in the cell’s phenotype. To enable phenotypic expression of altered mtDNA in an adult individual, the number of mutated copies must be greater than that of wild-type copies. The intensity and type of clinical symptoms can depend on the degree of heteroplasmy and change with the patient’s age. Mitochondrial DNA mutations have been described in various disease entities with underlying dysfunction of the respiratory chain. The pathology of these diseases is associated with impaired functioning of organs made of tissues of high energy requirement, containing the greatest number of mitochondria. These mostly include the brain, skeletal muscles and eyes. It should be noted that mitochondrial diseases are characterised by genetic heterogeneity and pleiotropy. A single mutation in one gene manifests itself with numerous clinical effects for various tissues. The mutant gene causes many symptoms independent of one another. An example can be the A3243G mutation in the MT-TL1 gene, which manifests itself in various diseases–MELAS, diabetes with deafness, mitochondrial myopathy, gastrointestinal or renal symptoms even in the same family. Another problem is the relationship with gender and morbidity of certain mitochondrial diseases. An example of incomplete penetration of mutated genes of mitochondrial DNA associated with sex can be found in Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). About 50% of men and about 10% of women with a pathological change in mtDNA will experience optic neuropathy. This suggests that there must be additional mitochondrial and nuclear, and perhaps even environmental factors modifying the phenotype of LHON disease. 6. Mitochondrial DNA and Carcinogenesis 6.1. Mitochondrion Metabolism and Cancer An interest in the mitochondria in the context of carcinogenesis was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century by Otto Warburg, who noticed the predominance of the glycolysis process in cancer cells despite the availability of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis). The atypical physiology of cancer cells prompted the German biochemist to put forward a hypothesis about a significant role of cell respiratory disorders in carcinogenesis. However, the mechanism of this aberrant metabolic state remained a mystery. The contribution of glycolysis to ATP production appears to depend on the type of tissue (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The mean values of glycolytic distribution in total ATP production are 20% for normal cells and 17% for cancer cells. It is now believed that the Warburg effect occurs only in fibroblasts in the tumour cell stroma. Aerobic glycolysis is thought to occur in fibroblasts that provide cancer cells with high energy compounds such as lactate, ketones and glutamine. These compounds are presumably used for anabolic processes and the formation of ATP in the process of aerobic respiration by cancer cells, which is assumed to contribute to the progression of cancer. This process is called the reverse Warburg effect (Figure 3). In addition, the Crabtree effect can occur in cancer cells. Cancerous and rapidly proliferating cells can reversibly convert the fermentation process into oxidative metabolism, depending on the presence of glucose in the cell or in its environment. In the presence of glucose, after a short period of activation of oxidative phosphorylation, the energetic metabolism switches from oxygen to glycolytic and inhibits the intensity of cellular respiration. It is accompanied by acidification of the environment and reduction of nicotinamide nucleotides. The possibility of reversible suppression of oxidative phosphorylation can be an advantage of tumour cells in vivo due to the adaptation of their metabolism to inhomogeneous conditions of the microenvironment of malignant tumours. The level of phosphate and calcium ions can also influence the Crabtree effect in a cancer cell. In tumour cells, after the addition of glucose, the level of phosphate ions decreases and, as a result, the thermodynamic phosphate potential changes. The increase in glucose levels may also be accompanied by Ca2+ accumulation. The Ca2+ influx inhibits oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting ATP synthase in tumour cells (as in the mitochondria of normal tissues). Due to the activation of glycolysis, the supply of ADP adenosine diphosphate and phosphate, whose deficiency should limit oxidative phosphorylation, is reduced. Oxidative phosphorylation can be regulated by the mitochondrial outer membrane that regulates substrate access to the intermembrane space. Hexokinase II binds to the external mitochondrial membrane at the fusion sites between the outer and inner membranes. Based on studies on hepatocellular cancer cell metabolism, it was found that the predominance of glycolysis is associated with a disturbed ratio of expressed enzymes, more precisely hexokinases. By contrast with healthy cells, cancer cells present a predominance of hexokinase II over hexokinase IV. This is undoubtedly associated with the fact that mutated TP53 or hypoxia typical of cancer cells have a positive effect on hexokinase II expression. When hexokinase II undergoes phosphorylation, it develops a capacity to directly bind with an ion channel of the mitochondrial membrane that participates in ATP-dependent transport (voltage-dependent anion channel, VDAC). As a result, glucose is rapidly phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate, and hexokinase II loses its sensitivity to inhibition by G-6-phosphate. In this mechanism, cancer cell metabolism changes from aerobic to anaerobic. Additional significant consequences that should be mentioned here are the blockage of the Bax and Bak proteins, which take part in apoptosis induction, and stabilisation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mtPTP). 6.2. Changes in Mitochondrial DNA and Carcinogenesis Mutations in mtDNA that occur in germ cells or are inherited in the maternal lineage may increase predisposition to a given cancer. Moreover, mtDNA mutations in postmitotic cells are not inherited, but may play a role both in initiation and progression of cancer. A role of the mitochondrial genome in carcinogenesis is also supported by a relationship between the presence of a circular dimer form–a double-length circular molecule–and complex catenated forms of mitochondrial DNA in leukemic leukocytes and a severe course of granulocytic leukaemia. It seems that these mutations are of de novo nature as they appear in the form of slowly progressing clinical symptoms, probably a long time after the occurrence of mutation (when mutated DNA becomes prevalent over wild-type DNA). As most cancerous mutations are homoplasmic, there must be an adequate number of cell divisions, and altered mtDNA must be sent to most mitochondria. The conventional homoplasmy model assumes the occurrence of intramitochondrial segregation and predominance of one type of mtDNA in the mitochondria, so-called functional advantage. At the cellular level, the mitochondria with one type of mtDNA become prevalent. During cell division, replicative segregation takes place. It consists in a change of proportions between mutated and normal mtDNA, with the predominance of altered mitochondria (selective advantage). This leads to the presence of only one type of mtDNA in subsequent cell divisions, i.e., homoplasmy. In the mathematical model, cell homoplasmy is an effect of incidental mitochondrial segregation that occurs during subsequent divisions (genetic drift). As a result of the genetic drift, rare mtDNA variants can be either eliminated or fixed. Selective growth of cells with mutated mtDNA may also result from changes in nDNA. Nuclear DNA may stimulate proliferation of cells with altered mitochondria, yielding daughter cells with one type of mtDNA, which initiates tumour growth. The period needed to reach the predominance of mutated mtDNA or cell homoplasmy would correspond to the phase of cancer transformation. The expression of changes in mtDNA also depends on the type of gene affected, type of mutation, type of tissue in which mutation occurs and its energy requirement, as well as the mitochondrial subgroup to which a given individual belongs. Moreover, the coexistence of mtDNA polymorphisms or their specific configuration may also be significant in cell dysfunction. Mutations occurring in mtDNA can be beneficial, neutral or harmful. Humans adjust to the changing environment thanks to mtDNA mutations. During evolution, mutations enabled adaptation to the changing climate. However, they can also become a cause of predisposition to certain diseases, including cancers. As for carcinogenesis, two types of mtDNA mutations are distinguished, tumorigenic and adaptive. The harmful tumorigenic group includes end-chain mutations and missense mutations, which lead to changes in a coded amino acid in a protein, and point deletions or insertions. The effects of these mitochondrial genetic changes may lead to impaired functioning of the respiratory chain, entailing an increase in reactive oxygen species, which may contribute to further mtDNA mutations. The developing free radicals may be both initiators and promoters of carcinogenesis. Both in nDNA and in mtDNA, guanine residues are preferentially damaged by free radicals, which induces G > T transversions. However, age-related point mutations of mtDNAs are characterised by mainly G > A transition and only a small percentage of G > T transversion, which may be caused by transcription errors. In the case of colorectal cancer, 70% of mutations involved T to C and G to A replacement. Adaptive mutations result from cell adaptation to changing environmental conditions. These include missense mutations or control region mutations that lead to replication and transcription modulation, making a cancer cell adjust to unfavourable bioenergetic conditions during metastasising. In the studies on the role of mtDNA in carcinogenesis, the Hayashi group demonstrated mutagenicity of the mutations G13997A and 13885insC in the ND6 gene. Both of these mutations were responsible for deficiency in respiratory complex I and increased production of ROS in the high-metastatic line carcinoma A11 (Lewis lung carcinoma and high-metastatic line fibrosarcoma P82M). Cell lines (i.e., low-metastatic line carcinoma P29) without these mutations did not show overproduction of ROS. Application of ROS scavenger in the P29mtA11 cybrids reduced both the ROS production and the metastatic potential in mouse model. Similarly, mtDNA ATP6 mutations (T8993G) into the PC3 prostate cancer cell line result in both an increase in ROS production and faster tumour growth, compared to wild-type hybrids in mice. Furthermore, changes in mtDNA copy number in cells are reported in cancer. There is some conflicting information about the number of mtDNA copies in cancer cells. For example, an increase was reported in papillary thyroid carcinoma and primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, while in gastric cancer a depletion was observed. The number of mtDNA copies in cancer cells may be associated with a specific site of mutation related to the type of tumour. Mutations in nuclear genes or response to mtDNA impairment may have a role in controlling mtDNA copy number. However, the number of copies may affect the expression of respiratory genes, exogenous and environmental influences should also be taken into account. In a study on three models of tumourigenesis (i.e., glioblastoma multiforme, multiple myeloma and osteosarcoma), it was shown that mtDNA copy number has an influence on early and late cancer progression. Tumour cells with a decreased number of mtDNA copies restored their number, which increased the tumour growth rate. MtDNA copy number in tumour cells can have an influence on the onset of cancer. For example, a decreased mtDNA copy number in colorectal cancer was associated with lymph-node metastasis and lower survival rates. In another study, it was shown that mtDNA depletion may have an important role in tumour progression because of a correlation with aberrant nuclear-encoded genes. The mechanism of changes in the number of mtDNA copies in cancer cells is not yet well understood. Additionally, when describing mitochondrial DNA variants, we should mention the mitochondrial-nuclear crosstalk phenomenon which is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction, caused by mtDNA modification, can contribute to epigenetic changes in the nuclear genome, such as DNA and chromatin alterations and singling through small RNA. This, in turn, may lead to the continuance of the oncogenic transformation initiated by the mitochondrion. The process of signal transmission is not fully understood. 6.3. mtDNA Polymorphisms and Haplogroups Associated with Cancer One of the first discovered polymorphisms associated with cancer was characterised by a replacement of guanine with adenine at position 10,398, leading to a change in codon A114T (A–alanine, T–threonine) in the ND3 gene–G10398A. It caused alterations in the respiratory complex I. This polymorphism presumably increases the likelihood of invasive breast carcinoma in African American women, compared with women with guanine at this position (G10398A). This relationship, however, does not supposedly concern the Caucasian race. Based on a study involving a Polish population, the A10398G polymorphism is associated with greater incidence of this cancer. The same conclusion was drawn from a study evaluating a non-Jewish European–American population. Additionally, it showed that a higher risk of breast cancer was associated with mitochondrial haplogroup K, while the lowest risk was noted in haplogroup U. Apart from the A10398G polymorphism, two other polymorphisms have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, T16519C and G9055A. Polymorphisms T3197C (OR = 0.31, 95% CI, 0.13–0.75, p = 0.0043) and G13708A (OR = 0.47, 95% CI, 0.24–0.92, p = 0.022) supposedly lower this risk. In one of the studies conducted in a Polish population, involving mutations and polymorphisms within the MT-ND1, MT-ND-2, MT-ND3, and MT-ND6 genes in breast cancer cells, there were 28 polymorphisms, mostly located within the MT-ND-2 gene, that were absent from healthy cells. Some of them are associated with mitochondrial diseases, such as C4640T, often occurring in patients with LHON. The G10398A polymorphism increases the risk of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in haplogroup N and oral cancer in haplogroup M. It must be underlined, however, that there are studies that do not corroborate the role of polymorphisms, A10398G in particular, in breast cancer. As for prostate cancer, studies investigating mutations and polymorphisms within a gene encoding subunit I of respiratory complex IV COI are significant. Four non-synonymous mutations in the COI gene, associated with given mitochondrial haplogroups, have been discovered in prostate cancer cells. T6253C mutation was detected in cancer cells of haplogroup H individuals. C6340T mutation was found in haplogroups J, T, L1 and N, G6261A mutation occurred in haplogroups H and N, while A6663G mutation was discovered in patients with haplogroups L0 and L2. These are homoplasmic changes, which attests to positive selection of mutated mtDNA in subsequent cell divisions. When comparing the incidence of COI polymorphisms in the African and American population of European ancestry, the rates were 17.4% and 6.5%, respectively, suggesting a higher risk of prostate cancer in the former group. Polymorphisms T6221C and T7389C are significantly associated with prostate cancer (p < 0.05). Detected mutations, such as G5949A (G16X), T6124C (M74), C6924T (A341S), also concern highly conserved amino acids examined in an American population (482 men with prostate cancer and 189 men without cancer), where COI polymorphisms were detected in 8.8% of Caucasian patients with prostate cancer and in 72.8% of cancer patients of African ancestry. Moreover, the rate of polymorphisms in the Caucasian controls was 0.0% compared with 64.3% in African Americans. Missense mutations in the COI gene occurred in 116 of 482 (24.2%) patients with prostate cancer. Detected A5935G and G5949A mutations were related to highly conserved amino acids (CI–conservation index 100%). In a study conducted among white inhabitants of North America, mitochondrial haplogroup U was linked with an increased risk of prostate and renal cancers. However, subsequent studies did not support the relationship of prostate cancer with haplogroup U. In a study involving a South European population with vesicular and papillary thyroid carcinoma, the authors reported a protective role of mitochondrial haplogroup K in relation to these cancers. Furthermore, Chinese reports indicate a relationship between haplogroup D4a and increased incidence of thyroid carcinoma. This study also showed an increased risk of breast cancer in haplogroup M, particularly when women also belonged to subgroup D5. Haplogroups M7 and M8 increased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The D-loop is highly polymorphous, and the literature reports the presence of numerous changes in this region in various cancers. These changes have been reported for ovarian carcinoma, oesophageal cancer, glioma, renal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and others. Polymorphisms in the D-loop region such as 73G/A, 146T/C, 195T/C, 324C/G, 16261C/T, and 16304T/C are associated with an increased risk of developing colon cancer. One of the studies on a Polish population concluded that haplogroup H with the C7028T polymorphism may be considered a protective factor in endometrial cancer. This polymorphism has also been reported in patients with sensorineural hearing loss. The C7028T polymorphism is diagnostic for mitochondrial haplogroup R and referential for subgroup H. Czarnecka et al. also found an association between the occurrence of three polymorphisms, 16223C, 16126C and 207A, in the D-loop region of mtDNA in endometrial cancer. A polymorphism consisting in T > C transition in the highly polymorphous D-loop region 16,189 is linked not only with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but also with increased incidence of endometrial cancer, glioma and breast cancer. One of the studies addressing breast cancer and mtDNA mutations within the D-loop and MT-ND4 gene revealed correlations between BRCA1 mutation and haplogroup X, and between BRCA2 mutation and haplogroup H.  The occurrence of single nucleotide polymorphisms within the D-loop is said to increase the risk of renal-cell carcinoma. Alterations in nucleotide sequences 16,293 A > G and 262 A > G concern clear-cell renal carcinoma, while 488 T > C refers to papillary tumours and benign oncocytoma. As for urinary bladder cancer, there are reports about its relationship with the D-loop C16069T polymorphism. Haplogroup M7b2 presumably increases the risk of haematological cancers. The A12308G polymorphism, which is a marker of haplogroup U and relates to the tRNA gene for leucine 2, is said to raise a risk of renal and prostate cancers (odds ratio OR = 2.52 and 1.95, respectively). In research on mitochondrial polymorphisms in cancer, some authors went even further and searched for their influence on prognosis. In gastric carcinoma, survival was longer in patients with haplogroup N (489T) than in patients with haplogroup M. As for hepatocellular carcinoma, patients with cytosine at position 146 in mtDNA were characterised by shorter survival, compared with patients with thymine at this position (relative risk, 2.781, 95% CI, 1.127–6.859, p = 0.026). Three other mutations (T15784C, C16185T, A16399G) were associated with a better prognosis in patients with haplogroup M7 and M8. In colon cancer and nSCLC, mutations detected in ND genes correlated with the presence of distant metastases (p < 0.05). When investigating a relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms and survival in small-cell lung carcinoma, one study among Chinese people revealed longer survival in patients with the 16390A polymorphism, compared to those with guanine at this position. In the case of colorectal carcinoma, the 10398 A > G polymorphism, leading to the replacement of the amino acid in subunit ND3 (T114A), is said to be conducive to distant metastases. This polymorphism has also been discovered in women with breast cancer. However, there was no relationship of overall survival and progression-free survival in colorectal carcinoma with this polymorphism and 5 other polymorphisms, T479C, T491C, T10035C, A13781G, and T16189C. As for prostate cancer, prognosis in patients with haplogroup L0, and particularly L0d, was worse than in the case of patients with haplogroups other than L0. These patients had higher Gleason Score (6.3 versus 4.9, p = 0.049). A summary of changes in mtDNA associated with cancer is presented in Table 1. 7. Mitochondrial Haplogroups and Chronic Diseases Individual mitochondrial haplogroups can be associated with a risk of developing certain chronic diseases. The occurrence of a polymorphism in the HVRI region of mtDNA in the form of T > C transition at position 16,189 may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which has been shown in a study involving a European population. This has also been confirmed in an Asian group, where it was additionally found that haplotype B4 with SNP T16189C is associated with greater susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus. This polymorphism has also been linked with an increased incidence of MELAS syndrome. Neurodegenerative conditions, in which the mitochondria undoubtedly play a significant pathogenetic role, are being investigated by scientists studying mtDNA. It has been noted that the risk of Parkinson’s disease is higher in people with haplogroup J and T characterised by T to C substitution at position 4216 of the ND1 gene in mtDNA, which results in a replacement of tyrosine to histidine at position 304 of the protein and leads to reduced activity of this complex in affected cells, thereby increasing the frequency of ND1 mutation. This polymorphism is also said to be associated with LHON and insulin resistance. Individuals with haplogroup J in the European population have also been observed to carry an increased risk of LHON syndrome, which is associated with more frequent 14484T > C mutation in the mitochondrial MT-ND6 gene. However, other authors argue that the association of LHON with any haplogroup is weak, which supports the need for more research on mtDNA polymorphisms. A study in a Portuguese population revealed a lower risk of ischaemic stroke in haplogroup H1. Subhaplogroup K, in turn, has been considered a risk factor of ischaemic heart disease and transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), but not of acute coronary syndrome. As for neurodegenerative conditions, one of the studies involving a European population has shown an increase in the risk of Alzheimer’s disease among males from haplogroup U, compared to haplogroup H, the most common haplogroup in Europe. As already mentioned, diseases caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA in most cases give very different symptoms, even in members of the same family. Environmental factors can also affect the occurrence of the symptoms of a specific mutation. A strong correlation was found between cigarette smoking and LHON symptoms. Smoking increases the risk of blindness. It is possible that metabolic processes occurring in cells contribute to the modification of accumulating mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which translates into the phenotype of patients. It cannot be ruled out that coexistence of additional sense-type mutations may be responsible for the way these mutations occur. All the factors described above, such as gender, penetration, pleiotropy, tissue type, type of mutation, may be responsible for the way the mtDNA mutation is revealed. It may also explain why the increased risk of cancer has not been reported in a group of patients with mitochondrial disease yet. The understanding of these mitochondrial DNA dysfunctions is still incomplete.",4777
28906532,"Mitochondrial DNA Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the main noncommunicable cause of morbidity and mortality in humans. While environmental factors and lifestyle choices play a major role in CVD, it is also recognised that genetic factors contribute significantly to the aetiology thereof. In this regard, several studies, most recently genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have contributed to identifying genetic loci involved in CVDs, and their association with behavioural and biological risk factors. Despite the numerous nuclear DNA (nDNA) variants identified, only a small portion of the heredity of CVDs can thus far be accounted for by variants discovered with GWAS studies. For instance, the 46 loci identified for coronary artery disease (CAD) only account for about six to 13% of CAD hereditability. The mitochondrion is the only other source of DNA apart from the nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for 22 tRNAs, two rRNAs and 13 polypeptides thought important in the catalytic cores of complexes I, III, IV and V of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system (Fig. 1). In humans, mtDNA contains 16 569 bps and is double stranded. Depending on the energy needs of a specific tissue, each cell can contain hundreds to thousands of copies of mtDNA. mtDNA is maternally inherited and has a much higher mutation rate than nDNA, possibly 10 to 17 times higher. Maternal inheritance results in a lack of bi-parental recombination and therefore the evolution of mtDNA is defined by the emergence of distinct lineages called haplogroups. Multi-copy makes possible a condition called heteroplasmy, where more than one genotype is present in the same cell/ tissue/organism; homoplasmy then, is where all mtDNA copies carry the same allele. Notably, mtDNA is largely overlooked in GWASs, and could possibly contribute to the missing heredity of CVDs. Next we will consider two main arguments on the possible role of mtDNA variants in CVDs. Mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA damage in vascular health When considering mtDNA as a possible contributor to the aetiology of CVD, it should also be considered from a biological perspective. Much investigation has been conducted in an attempt to elucidate the risk factors and physiological mechanisms involved in the development of CVDs, such as sub-clinical atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiomyopathy and type 2 diabetes. An important common feature in all these conditions is inflammation in some form or another (Fig. 2). This inflammatory state is thought to be caused by oxidative stress, due to excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can be produced in several pathways, including by enzymes such as NADPH oxidase, nitric oxide synthase, and enzyme complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC). The general mechanism of ROS involvement in CVDs is ascribed to oxidative effects. For example, ROS contributes to atherosclerotic lesion formation by oxidising lipids, promoting vessel wall uptake of inflammatory cells, and enhancing proliferation and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Several studies have shown increased levels of ROS in hypertensive humans and rats. In cultured VSMCs for example, ROS has been shown to cause changes in cellular signalling pathways, favouring vasoconstriction. A mechanism for this could be that ROS reduces nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability via quenching, impairing endotheliummediated vasodilation. However, ROS along with other factors of a dysfunctional mitochondrial energy metabolism (e.g. nucleotides, Ca2+) also act as effectors of retrograde signalling and the so-called cell danger response. Mitochondria are considered the major producers of ROS within the cell. In a recent article, Lopez-Armada et al. reviewed the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the inflammatory response and consequently in the pathology of various diseases, including CVDs. The authors described how mitochondrial dysfunction may modulate inflammatory processes by activating redox-sensitive inflammatory pathways and the NLRP3 inflammasome. In the vasculature, these alterations lead to disturbed endothelial homeostasis, which has been implicated in the pathology of CVDs, such as atherosclerosis. Indeed, some improvements in disease presentation of hypertension and diabetes have been observed in studies where chronic antioxidant treatment is applied. Another mechanism by which inflammation might be altered by mitochondrial dysfunction is through the resultant release of mtDNA into the cytosol and circulation. Because mtDNA is similar to bacterial DNA and not methylated, released mtDNA molecules are thought to induce an inflammatory state, which contributes to atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. mtDNA damage has also been shown to promote atherosclerosis directly, in the absence of oxidative stress. In a study by Yu et al., VSMCs showed increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation in a proof-reading deficient PolG-/-/ ApoE-/- mouse model. Increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β were also reported and implicated in mtDNA release into the cytosol and subsequent activation of the inflammasome. The authors went on to test the applicability of their findings in humans and concluded that an alternative mechanism for mtDNA defects mediate atherosclerosis development, independent of ROS; mtDNA defects lead to aberrant ECT function and consequently reduce ATP content in VSMCs, which then promote apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation, leading to increased atherosclerosis and risk of plaque rupture. Plaque vulnerability is further promoted by mtDNA defects via monocyte cell death and the resultant increased release of inflammatory cytokine. From these studies, it can be seen that mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly as a result of mtDNA variants or damage, can directly be implicated in mechanisms that encumber vascular health. mtDNA point mutations and cardiac involvement Clinically proven mtDNA mutations are also an important cause of inherited disease. To date, more than 250 deleterious point mutations and deletions of the mitochondrial genome have been clinically proven to be associated with certain disease phenotypes (www.mitomap.org). In several of these diseases, cardiovascular symptoms are an important part of the aetiology. Due to the very high levels of mtDNA population variation seen, both within and between human populations, the identification of mutations causing clinically manifesting disease proves to be a challenge, despite the small size of the mitochondrial chromosome. Initially, DiMauro and Schon had set specific criteria for defining the pathogenicity of mtDNA mutations. The list has subsequently been updated to include important methods such as functional testing and singlefibre analysis, which can more specifically link genotype to phenotype. Notably, a pathogenicity scoring system for mitochondrial tRNAs was devised by McFarland et al. and further refined by Yarham et al. Mitchell et al. also devised a pathogenicity scoring system using variants in complex I mtDNA genes, but this can be applied to any structural mtDNA mutation. A list of these criteria is given in Table 1. It should be noted that there are mtDNA mutations that are exceptions to all the ‘rules’ in Table 1, and this was a critical motivation for algorithms or clinical scoring systems to help weigh the evidence that is presented for each mutation. For a clinically proven mutation to manifest as a diseased phenotype, as in the case of primary mitochondrial disorders, the allele frequency (heteroplasmy) needs to exceed a certain threshold, usually above 60%, referred to as the phenotypical threshold effect. The biochemical threshold effect then refers to the ability of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system to resist the metabolic expression of deficiencies therein. These deficiencies may be caused by various factors involved in the expression and regulation of the OXHPOS complexes. There are many complexities to the expression of mtDNA mutations; a classic example is the mitochondrial tRNA mutation m.3243A>G, the most common of the mtDNA mutations causing mitochondrial disease. The m.3243A>G mutation can result in a vast array of clinical phenotypes affecting multiple systems within the body, causing two distinct clinical syndromes: maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD), and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episode (MELAS) syndrome in severe cases. Furthermore, the age of onset of m.3243A>G-associated phenotypes spans more than 50 years. The impact of several confounding factors, including heteroplasmy levels, remains unclear. Another group of well-studied mutations are those that cause the disease Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). In contrast to the m.3243A>G mutation, LHON has a tissuespecific phenotype manifesting as bi-lateral blindness. Several mtDNA mutations have been implicated in LHON, while three of these mutations, namely m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A and m.14484T>C located in subunits ND1, ND4 and ND6 of complex I, respectively, account for 90 to 95% of cases. Unusually, these mutations can be detected as homoplasmic variants without exerting a phenotype. Rather, disease penetrance is significantly influenced by confounding factors such as gender and environment (clinical penetrance is increased to 93% in smoking men), and mtDNA haplogroup background (haplogroup J, K and M7 increase risk of clinical penetrance). The heart has especially high energy needs and relies heavily on OXPHOS-derived ATP, such that one-third of cardiomyocyte volume consists of mitochondria. Not surprisingly then, the myocardium is frequently affected in primary mitochondrial disorders. In a retrospective review study by Yaplito-Lee et al., 33% of paediatric patients with definitive OXPHOS disorders had cardiac manifestations. Several mtDNA mutations (Fig. 3, Table 2 [online]) have also been shown to exhibit cardiac involvement, either as part of a multi-system syndrome (most frequently seen in MELAS), or as isolated occurrences, such as in the absence of associated CVDs or risk factors thereof. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hCM) and pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) are the two phenotypes most commonly seen as isolated cardiac manifestations of primary mitochondrial disorders. If clinically proven mtDNA mutations can directly lead to cardiac dysfunction, is it plausible to think that other mtDNA variants, such as population variants of mildly deleterious effect, might also lead to or alter severity/penetrance of complex cardiovascular disease phenotypes. From the substantial supportive evidence of mitochondrial involvement in cardiovascular disease, it is therefore evident that genetic investigations on the aetiology of CVD should include consideration of mtDNA variations. In the following sections, we present a number of approaches (plus findings from such investigations) on how mtDNA variation is investigated/ associates in/with disease, with a specific focus on the approaches more likely to show its putative contribution to the risk of CVD development. Current approaches used for investigating mtDNA involvement in disease Mitochondrial DNA copy number mtDNA copy number can be used as an indicative marker of mitochondrial biogenesis, which is thought to increase in response to increased energy demands, such as exercise, but also as a compensatory method for mitochondrial dysfunction. On the other hand, mtDNA copy number has been shown to decrease with aging, and has been significantly correlated with late-onset diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease. As mentioned above, cell-free circulating mtDNA may also act as an inflammatory agent that contributes to CVDs. Altered mtDNA copy number measured in peripheral blood cells have been shown to be associated with different complications of diabetes (diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy). Also, an association between telomere length and mtDNA copy number suggests a co-regulatory mechanism for these two parameters, both of which are implicated in aging. mtDNA depletion and impaired mitochondrial biogenesis have been shown to be a constant factor in the early stages of heart failure and other diseases thought to be related to aberrant ROS production. While the exact mechanisms behind mtDNA content regulation are still unclear, it seems changes in either direction can be causative or indicative of disease. Measurement of mtDNA copy number can be done accurately by real-time PCR methods, making this a useful approach for investigating the role of mitochondrial metabolism in disease phenotypes. Common mtDNA population variants mtDNA variants accumulated over time differ between population groups that have been separated for several thousand years. Consequently, distinct lineages (mtDNA haplogroups) can be drawn according to these sets of unique changes in mtDNA, referred to as common population variants. The full human mtDNA phylogeny can be accessed at www.phylotree.org. Much of the variation seen in modern humans is to be found in the African haplogroups L0 to L6, but this variation has not been as fully described as the variation on other continents. European (e.g. I, J, K, H, T, U, V, W, X) and Asian (e.g. A, B, C, D, F, G) haplogroups fall within super haplogroups M and N, which in turn fall within L3. mtDNA haplogroup association studies aim therefore to associate these common mtDNA population variants with risk for various complex diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension or Parkinson’s disease. mtDNA background has been shown to correlate with the severity of cardiomyopathy caused by nDNAencoded mitochondrial protein mutations, and increases the penetrance of LHON-causing pathogenic mutations. It has been proposed that mtDNA population variants could contribute to the adaptability of population groups to their environment by altering mitochondrial enzyme function. By analysing non-synonymous variants in 104 complete mtDNA sequences from across the globe, Mishmar et al. found that the ATP6 and cytochrome b genes were particularly variable in arctic and temperate zones, respectively, leading them to believe that positive selection had taken place. Stressors, such as sudden changes in environment, could then influence the degree of disease susceptibility of these environmentally adapted population groups. However, this hypothesis was contested by others who have shown that there are significant differences in the same measure in haplogroups from the same environment. Additionally, Amo and Brand put forward evidence to suggest that certain bioenergetic parameters did not significantly differ between mitochondria from arctic versus tropical haplogroups. In contrast to the action of positive selection, the action of negative or purifying selection on mtDNA has been established for almost a decade. One important point to consider is that positive or directional selection could not have acted identically on all lineages, and therefore would result in a different rate of accumulation of variants on haplogroup lineages, thus affecting our ability to time divergence events by counting the mutational events between lineages. On the other hand, it is possible that negative or purifying selection could act evenly across lineages and not impact on our use of mtDNA as a molecular clock; the reliability of mtDNA as a molecular clock has been widely discussed. Because of the central role that mitochondria play in cell signalling and apoptosis, mitochondria have been implicated in several age-related diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. CVDs are also classified as late-onset diseases and mitochondria have also been implicated in CVDs. Consequently, haplogroup association studies on CVD phenotypes are plentiful, but, as will be revealed, also prone to pitfalls. Crispim et al. reported an association of European haplogroup cluster J/T with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in a Caucasian-Brazilian cohort. On the other hand, Li et al. found no association between mtDNA variation and risk for developing diabetes, while Chinnery et al.115 found no association with type 2 diabetes and major European haplogroups in a large study using 897 cases and 1 010 controls. Rather, Achilli et al. found that the risk for developing specific types of diabetes complications (disease outcome) was significantly associated with different mitochondrial haplogroups. Several mtDNA population variants in cytochrome c oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase subunit genes have been associated with body mass index (BMI) in adults. In a very large study using a second cohort, Chinnery et al. found no significant associations between mtDNA haplogroups and ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes or the metabolic syndrome, but did find a significant association of sub-haplogroup K with risk of cerebral ischaemic vascular effects. Therefore, while some studies investigating phenotypes included in CVDs have reported results that support a role for mtDNA in CVD, there are also conflicting reports. This is not only common in CVD-related literature, but all areas where haplogroup association studies have been applied. This is an indication of the many difficulties that need to be overcome when considering mtDNA variation in the context of disease. The unique way in which mtDNA is inherited (lack of bi-parental recombination), which results in the emergence of numerous unique haplogroups, contributes to the complexity encountered when investigating mtDNA involvement in disease. Non-biological factors such as differences in approach to statistical analysis; difficulty in proper case and control matching; small effective population size, which results in a higher likelihood of population stratification; and insufficient cohort size, further undermine the consistency of these studies. Meta-analysis of data generated by several studies with overlapping phenotypes can be employed to overcome sample size difficulties, but these bring along challenges of their own, as independent studies have different goals/methods, and do not necessarily generate directly comparable datasets. So, while haplogroup association studies might have fulfilled an important role in the ongoing pursuit of the involvement of mtDNA variation in disease, it is now well recognised that the field needs to consider alternative models. Rare mtDNA population variants It has been shown that negative or purifying selection plays a significant role in mtDNA evolution, with deleterious variants being removed from the population over time, and that the power of selection has been equally effective in all human lineages. Consequently, rare mtDNA population variants are more likely to be mildly deleterious than common variants, as selection has had less time to remove them from the populations. Indeed, rare mtDNA variants have been linked to changes in CVDs and risk factors. In a study by Govindaraj et al., complete mtDNA analysis revealed 10 non-synonymous variants present in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients, but not present in controls or on databases. Seven of these variants were classified as likely ‘pathogenic’, using several online scoring tools such as PolyPhen-2, PMUT and PROVEAN, and were therefore thought to be involved in the development of cardiomyopathy. Rare variants m.5913G>A and m.3316G>A have both been suggested to be associated with increased fasting blood glucose levels, while m.5913G>A was shown to also be associated with increased blood pressure in a selected Framingham heart study subset, all of whom were of European descent. In addition, several rare mtDNA variants, such as m.3316G>A, have been implicated in diabetes mellitus, of which an up-to-date list can be found on www.mitomap.org. Another possibility is that the effect of an accumulation of mildly deleterious variants may only become clinically significant once a population is challenged by a rapid change of confounding factors, such as diet or other environmental factors (toxins). In conclusion, several approaches are currently in use for investigating the role of mtDNA in common complex disease. mtDNA copy number is an emerging approach that might become more prevalent in studies concerning CVDs as well. In terms of mtDNA variants, rare population variants have been linked to several disease phenotypes, including CVD-related diseases such as cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus, and might be found to be associated with other CVDs or risk factors such as hypertension. Rare population variants are more likely to be mildly deleterious, but might not have a high enough impact on their own to alter disease onset; rather, these variants might be more likely to alter disease progression or outcomes. For common population variants, several haplogroup association studies have been done in CVDs, but have also been marred by the challenges these types of studies face. It seems then that an alternative approach to investigating the role of mtDNA variation in disease is needed when investigating common complex disease. Alternative approach for investigating mtDNA involvement in disease: the adjusted mutational load hypothesis An alternative approach, the mutational load hypothesis was put forward in Elson et al. Mutational load refers to the synergistic effect of several changes in, for example, a specific gene or functionally related set of genes. It does not look for associations with a specific variant but rather a summative effect. While some mtDNA variants might be of little effect on their own, an increased mutational load might be associated with increased risk for a certain disease. mtDNA mutational loads can then be adjusted to reflect the position within the phylogeny, since there are large differences in the average number of common population variants between haplogroups. This approach can also further be modified to, for example, exclude low-impact variants, highlighting the role of likely deleterious functional variants. Determining the likely impact or pathogenicity of mtDNA variants can be achieved by using several computational pathogenicity-predicting methods. An example of such a method is the MutPred system, which assigns a MutPred score to any protein-coding mtDNA variant, according to 14 gain/ loss properties of protein structure and function. The use of this system has been widely validated in the context of mtDNA studies, and performs better in an accuracy test when compared with several other methods. Therefore the question can be asked whether individuals in the disease group are impacted on by a combination of rare (mildly deleterious) variants or simply whether such variants are more common in the disease cohort than in the controls. The mutational load approach moves away from the study of haplogroups and looks at the collective effect of rare (or recent) variants, which are more likely to be deleterious. It distils the likely impact of a person’s mtDNA variation into a single value on a continuous scale rather than a letter. Consequently it will have more statistical power than conventional haplogroupassociation studies, as more powerful parametric statistics can be applied and fewer comparisons are required. It offers an alternative method to explore the involvement of mtDNA variants in disease phenotypes, including diseases thought to be related to mitochondrial dysfunction, such as CVDs. The unique challenges faced by studies in African populations While communicable diseases are still the leading causes of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), CVD particularly is a growing concern here, since the prevalence has risen markedly in recent times as more populations of developing countries become urbanised and are exposed to a diet and lifestyle that increase risk factors for CVD. Taking into account the many differences among ethnic groups in the onset and development of CVD, genomic investigations have also been used to investigate these disparities. However, the number of well-powered genetic studies on CVDs in African populations or people of African descent is much lower than in European populations. As yet, no conclusive nDNA genetic factor/s has been identified to help understand these disparities. Current Eurocentric reference panels used in GWAS studies to examine the involvement of population variants in disease have been shown to be of limited use in even common SSA population groups. This is indicative of the lack of African representation in our current databases. This lack extends to mtDNA as well. Of the more than 30 000 mtDNA sequences available on GenBank, only 13% of these are of African lineages (L0–6). This bias in published data results in the resolution of the phylogenetic tree being much higher in the European branches (especially super-haplogroup N descendant) than in the African roots, despite greater diversity within the latter. Comparatively few studies have been done where the involvement of mtDNA variation in CVD has been considered. Although of small size, one such study helps to highlight the challenges posed by these gaps in our current data. Ameh et al. could not find the tRNA mutation m.3243A>G in Nigerian type 2 diabetes patients, despite an association being previously reported in other European and Asian populations. This and other studies illustrate the difficulty of extrapolating genetic risk factors for disease from one population group to the next, and the need for population-specific studies.",3814
32575796,"1. Introduction Mitochondria are descendants from alpha-proteobacteria that survived after their endocytosis by eukaryotic progenitors, more than 1.5 billion years ago. These bacterial ancestors became symbiotic with their host cells and gradually gave rise to the permanent organelles found today in almost all eukaryotic cells. As a vestige of their bacterial endosymbiotic origin, mitochondria have retained their double membranes and circular genome. However, this mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been dramatically reduced over evolution, rendering mitochondria dependent on the nucleus for the expression of the vast majority of their proteins. As a result, the biogenesis and functionality of mitochondria are tightly regulated by the continuous crosstalk with the nucleus. The function usually assigned to mitochondria is their capacity to produce high amounts of ATP, from glucose breakdown, through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS-dependent ATP synthesis is supported by the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), composed of protein complexes and organic molecules, which conveys electrons to molecular oxygen and creates the electrochemical gradient needed for the functioning of ATP synthase. In tight connection with the ETC, metabolites are produced in the mitochondria through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle is composed of eight enzymes catalyzing the chemical breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to produce either ATP or building blocks for the synthesis of nucleic acids, amino-acids, and lipids. Beyond their role as energy and building-block producers, mitochondria also act as signaling organelles that govern cell fate by regulating essential biological processes, such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, as well as Ca2+ and redox homeostasis. Mitochondria are thus implicated in essential physiological and pathophysiological processes including tissue healing, inflammation, and cancer. The complexity and diversity of mitochondrial functions are reflected by their wide-ranging proteome of more than 1000 proteins. The already-extensive panel of mitochondrial functions has been further increased following the recent discovery of their capacity to translocate to other cells and to alter their behavior. This signaling role of mitochondria is also supported by their recently-documented capacity to release metabolites as well as mitochondrial fragments, also called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The severity of the diseases caused by mitochondrial dysfunctions confirms the critical importance of mitochondria for living cells. These diseases can originate from genetic mutations directly affecting the ETC activity or other mitochondrial functions. However, they can also be owing to unbalanced production of metabolites and mitochondrial components. The challenging identification of mitochondrial dysfunctions will need to be overcome in order to develop therapeutic strategies for the related metabolic, inflammatory, and malignant pathologies. Here, we present an overview of recent findings on the critical involvement of mitochondrial metabolites/compounds in the signaling functions of mitochondria and on the emergence of novel therapies for diseases caused by mitochondrial dysfunctions. 2. Role of the Mitochondrial ETC and OXPHOS in Physiology and Disease The respiratory machinery responsible for OXPHOS is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It includes the four complexes (I–IV) of the electron transport chain (ETC), the free-electron carriers ubiquinone and cytochrome c, and the ATP synthase (complex V) that produces OXPHOS-dependent ATP (Figure 1). The ETC machinery is encoded by both the nuclear DNA (nDNA) (80 proteins) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (13 proteins). Nuclear-encoded proteins (roughly 70% of total mitochondrial proteins) also have functions in ETC supercomplex (or respirasome) assembly and in mtDNA replication and repair. Therefore, nuclear and mitochondrial gene expressions need to be tightly coordinated to ensure effective mitochondrial functioning. Alterations in either result in mitochondrial defects, which makes their treatment particularly challenging. Mitochondrial DNA exhibits high mutation rates owing to (1) direct exposure to ETC-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), (2) asymmetric replication leading to higher exposure of the single H-strand, (3) intramitochondrial dNTP pool imbalance favoring dGTP incorporation, and (4) low-efficiency DNA repair mechanisms. Mitochondrial DNA mutations range from point mutations to large-scale DNA rearrangements. They can be found in cells together with their wild-type counterpart, a feature called heteroplasmy. Exceeding the critical heteroplasmy thresholds causes mutant mtDNA to trigger mitochondria-related pathologies. Mitochondrial diseases are characterized by genetic alterations that primarily compromise oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and OXPHOS-dependent ATP generation. Mitochondrial diseases thus affect organs that mainly rely on OXPHOS for energy supply, including the eye, ear, liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscles, as well as the brain. These diseases are associated with syndromes such as CPEO (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia), KSS (Kearns–Sayre syndrome), LHON (Leber hereditary optic neuropathy), MIDD (maternally inherited diabetes and deafness), MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (Leigh syndrome), MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers), and NARP (syndrome neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa). Mitochondrial disorders have also been associated with cancers in different organs, as detailed below. 3. Effects of Mutations in the Subunits of Complexes I and II of the ETC in Cancer Mitochondrial disorders play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis by orchestrating metabolic reprogramming, apoptosis, and ROS signaling at virtually all stages, from tumor initiation to metastasis, and mtDNA mutations have been proposed as drivers/modifiers of tumorigenesis in many cancers. Sequencing of mtDNAs from over 2000 tumor samples across over 30 tumor types revealed important features of the mitochondrial mutational signature. These large-scale studies identified intrinsic replicative errors, characterized by an asymmetric bias towards C > T and T > C transitions on the mtDNA heavy and light strands respectively, as the most prominent source of mtDNA mutations, overpowering the 4% caused by ROS exposure. While neutral missense mutations were found to gradually drift towards homoplasmy, deleterious frameshift or nonsense mutations, often resulting in truncated proteins, were almost exclusively heteroplasmic, thus highlighting a selective pressure in cancer cells to retain residual mitochondrial functionality. 3.1. Complex I Mutation-Induced ROS Production Promotes Tumorigenesis through Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K)/Protein Kinase B (AKT) Signaling, Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Alpha (HIF1α) Stabilization, and NADPH-Oxidase 1 (NOX1) Signaling Complex I of the ETC transfers electrons from NADH produced in the TCA cycle and from the β-oxidation of fatty acids to ubiquinone. This reaction is accompanied by the translocation of four protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space, which generates a transmembrane electrochemical gradient and drives final ATP production by complex V (Figure 1). Complex I is the largest (1 MDa) and most elaborate complex of the ETC. X-ray crystallography revealed a structure with two L-shaped arms: a peripheral arm that catalyzes the redox reaction and an inner membrane-embedded arm containing the proton-translocating machinery. Complex I is composed of 14 conserved core subunits, encoded by both the mitochondrial and nuclear DNAs, and of at least 30 additional nuclear-encoded accessory subunits. Half the core subunits (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, ND6) are mitochondria-encoded and constitute the membrane-embedded arm, while the other half (NDUFS1, NDUFV1, NDUFV2, NDUFS2, NDUFS3, NDUFS8, NDUFS7) are nuclear-encoded and constitute the peripheral arm. Complex I is the main target of the currently-identified mtDNA mutations. Taking into account both mtDNA and nDNA origins, mutations are found in all 14 catalytic core subunits, in 13 accessory subunits, and in at least 11 assembly factors. They have been described in cancers as diverse as head and neck, breast, thyroid, prostate, renal, and hepatocellular cancers. The technique of transmitochondrial cybrids, which consists of repopulating ρ0 cells (depleted of their mtDNA) with exogenous mitochondria, has been widely used to establish the role of mtDNA variants in pathologies, independent of nDNA backgrounds. Transmitochondrial cybrid studies thus showed that complex I mutants can exhibit both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects in cancer, in an OXPHOS- and ROS-dependent fashion, as detailed below. 3.1.1. PI3K/AKT Signaling The ND5 m.12418insA frameshift mutation, found in colorectal cancers, leads to a truncated ND5 protein, which destabilizes the assembly of the membrane-embedded arm of complex I. As shown in 143B osteosarcoma transmitochondrial cybrids, the effects of this mutant highly depended on its heteroplasmy level. While a 72% ND5 mutant heteroplasmy still retained 46% residual complex I activity, ND5 mutant homoplasmy (96%) led to loss of complex I function. These effects were associated, as expected, with a gradual decrease of OXPHOS-dependent oxygen consumption and ATP production. Heteroplasmic cybrids exhibited increased levels of mitochondria-specific ROS (but not of intracellular ROS), which correlated with the overexpression of the catalase, the glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4), and the Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) anti-oxidative enzymes. This enhanced ROS production also activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and the expression of downstream genes encoding the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α) and the anti-apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-XL) and induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1) (Figure 2). Osteosarcoma cybrids harboring a heteroplasmic ND5 mutation were thus endowed with resistance to oxidative stress and, subsequently, enhanced tumorigenicity upon subcutaneous injection in nude mice. ND5-mutant homoplasmic cybrids, however, showed increased levels in both mitochondrial and intracellular ROS, which led to apoptosis and prevented tumor formation in vivo. 3.1.2. HIF1α Stabilization The ND1m.3571insC frameshift mutation, observed in thyroid oncocytic carcinoma, also generates a truncated ND1 protein, which leads to complex I disassembly. Transmitochondrial osteosarcoma cybrids expressing this ND1 mutant totally lost their complex I activity and their basal oxygen consumption, revealing a dramatic OXPHOS deficit. Complex I dysfunction also induced the accumulation of NADH, an allosteric inhibitor of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which led to increased α-ketoglutarate levels and to HIF1α destabilization (Figure 2). These osteosarcoma cybrids did not form tumors in vivo. Another ND1mutation (missense m.3460G>A, A52T) showed a weaker phenotype as homoplasmic osteosarcoma cybrids retained 50% of complex I activity, with only a partial reduction in basal oxygen consumption. These mutants were still able to form tumors upon xenograft in mice, a tumorigenic potential linked to cytoplasmic ROS accumulation and HIF1α stabilization. A third type of mutation (m.4776G>A; A103T), found in the ND2 subunit of complex I in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, also illustrates the role of ROS accumulation and HIF1α stabilization in tumorigenesis. This mutation, which impaired cell respiration and increased ROS production, led to a feedback metabolic signaling involving pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2). ROS-induced PDK2 activity resulted in increased pyruvate, HIF1α activation and tumor growth (Figure 2). Finally, the highly-metastatic capacities of murine Lewis lung carcinoma and fibrosarcoma were attributed to the missense m.13997G>A (P25L) and frameshift m.13885insC mutations, respectively, in the mtDNA ND6-encoding gene, as further confirmed in cybrids. The increased metastatic capacity of these complex I mutants was also associated with a higher ROS production, which led to high levels of HIF1α, of the anti-apoptotic MCL-1 protein, and of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thus nurturing neoangiogenesis. Consistent with this role of ROS, pretreatment of highly-metastatic cybrids with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) decreased MCL-1 expression in vitro and reduced metastasis in vivo. 3.1.3. NOX1 Signaling NADPH-oxidase 1 (NOX1) activity was also shown to contribute to tumorigenesis, together with increased mitochondrial ROS, as a result of complex I dysfunction. The various osteosarcoma cybrids analyzed, carrying the m.3460G>A/MT-ND1 (A52T), m.11778G>A/MT-ND4 (R340H), and m.14484T>C/MT-ND6 (M64V) point mutations, respectively, exhibited decreased OXPHOS and ATP production. Their enhanced tumorigenicity, upon xenograft in nude mice, was associated with increased levels of both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ROS as well as increased activity of NOX1, resulting in the production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, major sources of cytoplasmic ROS (Figure 2). Overall, mutations in complex I appear to exert anti-tumorigenic effects only upon complete abolishment of complex I function, which prevents ROS production. Milder mutations, which preserve some complex I activity, enhance ROS production and stimulate tumor growth. 3.2. OXPHOS-Harmful Complex I Mutations Elicit Metabolic Compensation 3.2.1. Shift towards Glycolysis Several studies reported that OXPHOS dysfunction, as a consequence of complex I impairment, leads to a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, which enables cells to maintain cell growth and ATP production. This metabolic shift was reported in transmitochondrial osteosarcoma cybrids harboring the m.12418insA/MT-ND5 mutation. Increasing the mutational load from 72% of mutant ND5 in heteroplasmic cybrids to 96% in homoplasmic cybrids gradually decreased respiration (from 53% to 17% of wild type (WT)) and OXPHOS-linked ATP production (from 21% to 2% of WT), while it concomitantly increased glucose uptake and lactate production (from 28% to 56% of WT). Likewise, as shown for another subunit of complex I, osteosarcoma cells harboring the severe m.3571insC/MT-ND1 mutation showed increased glucose uptake and lactate production, while the milder m.3460G>A/MT-ND1 mutant had a glucose metabolism similar to that of the wild-type cells. This glycolytic shift observed in transmitochondrial osteosarcoma cybrids was ascribed to HIF1α activation. HIF1α stimulated the expression of the glucose transporters 1 (SLC2A1) and 3 (SLC2A3) as well as a series of glycolytic enzymes, including phosphofructokinase (PFKP), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA). Taken together, these data indicate that complex I mutations could induce a Warburg-like effect in cancer cells, fostering tumor growth. 3.2.2. Shift towards Complex II-Dependent Succinate Oxidation Beyond the Warburg effect, a metabolic shift towards complex II-dependent succinate oxidation was recently described as an adaptive mechanism to compensate for OXPHOS dysfunction in high-grade prostate cancers, mutant for the ND1 subunit of complex I. As a response to the inhibition of glutamate and malate oxidation and to the subsequent electron transport loss across complex I, ND1-mutant cancer cells were found to produce ATP by aerobic respiration through complex II-mediated succinate oxidation. This metabolic reprogramming was associated with shorter patient survival, highlighting the critical role of complex II and succinate in malignancies associated with complex I dysfunction. 3.2.3. Shift towards Serine Catabolism The catabolism of serine, a precursor for nucleic acids, proteins, and fatty acids, was also shown to maintain OXPHOS activity in colon cancer cells with mutant complex I, by producing NADH and feeding it to the ETC. Higher NADH levels than expected could be reached through serine catabolism because of the insensitivity to NADH concentrations of MTHFD2 (methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2), the enzyme involved in this conversion. Overall, these findings demonstrate the various ways tumor cells manage to get around complex I dysfunction to maintain efficient OXPHOS. 3.2.4. Complex I Loss Alleviates Complex V Dysfunction By applying a genome-wide CRISPR screening on human K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells concomitantly treated with oligomycin, an inhibitor of complex V, Mootha and colleagues identified a series of both synthetic lethal mutants and suppressors showing that complex I mutations can alleviate complex V dysfunction. Mechanistically, concomitant inhibition of complexes I and V was accompanied by an increased reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate. Experimental depletion of cytosolic NADPH, known to drive reductive pathways, suppressed the protective effect of complex I loss against complex V inactivation, thus supporting the role of reductive metabolism in these effects. 3.3. Complex II Dysfunction Induces Tumorigenicity via Succinate Accumulation Complex II, also known as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and succinate ubiquinone oxidoreductase, has the unique property of linking both the TCA cycle and the ETC by coupling succinate oxidation to fumarate within the TCA cycle with ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) reduction to ubiquinol in the ETC. Complex II is composed of four subunits solely encoded by nuclear genes (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD). SDHA oxidizes succinate to fumarate, while reducing FAD to FADH2. Electrons from FADH2 are then transferred sequentially to SDHB and to ubiquinone at the inner membrane-embedded site formed by SDHC and SDHD. Contrary to complexes I, III, and IV, complex II-mediated electron transport is not accompanied by proton translocation into the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Deleterious mutations in any of the four subunits of complex II decrease SDH activity and result in abnormal accumulation of succinate, as observed in complex II-mutated cells in vitro and in the extracellular fluids (plasma, urine, saliva, and feces) of complex II-deficient patients. Complex II mutations, principally affecting SDHB and SDHD subunits, have been associated with various cancers including hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma (i.e., neuroendocrine tumors of the paraganglionic tissue), gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, SDH has now been defined as a tumor suppressor and succinate as an oncometabolite. 3.3.1. Complex II Mutations Inhibit 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenases The R22X nonsense SDHD mutation found in hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma generates a truncated SDHD protein of 21 amino acids (instead of 159), resulting in the loss of complex II electron transfer and enzymatic activities and in the activation of the HIF1α signaling pathway. The R22X nonsense SDHD mutation leads to succinate accumulation, which inhibits the activity of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) and, consequently, induces HIF1α stabilization. PHD is a 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG, also known as α-ketoglutarate)-dependent dioxygenase that, in normal settings, hydroxylates HIF1α and leads to its poly-ubiquitylation by the Von Hippel–Lindau protein (pVHL) complex and, ultimately, to its degradation by proteasomes (Figure 3). Succinate is structurally similar to 2-OG. It thus acts as a competitive inhibitor for PHD and promotes HIF1α stabilization. Succinate accumulation resulting from complex II mutations was shown to inhibit other 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases, including the Jumonji C (JmjC)-domain containing histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) and the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of DNA hydroxylases (Figure 3). TET enzymes mediate DNA oxidative demethylation through 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylation into 5-hydroxy-methylcytosine (5hmC). Succinate accumulation was shown to reduce TET-induced levels of 5hmC in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) with SDHA/B knockdown as well as in mice livers with transient SDHA knockdown. In line with these observations, DNA hypermethylation was found in SDHx-mutated paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma samples and in SDH-deficient gastrointestinal stromal samples, as a result of succinate inhibition of KDM and TET enzymes. 3.3.2. The Hypermethylator Phenotype: A Double-Edged Sword for Complex II-Mutated Cancers As mentioned above, SDH mutations can promote tumorigenesis by a succinate-mediated genome-wide epigenetic remodeling. As shown in mouse SDHB-knockout chromaffin cells, increased succinate levels were associated with CpG island hypermethylation in the promoters of genes encoding proteins such as the matrix-metalloprotease inhibitor SPOCK2, the metastasis suppressor DNAJA4, and the cell adhesion marker KRT19, thus resulting in a derepression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Succinate accumulation following SDHB-knockdown also led to an EMT-like phenotype in a murine serous ovarian carcinoma cell line, which was attributed to H3K27 hypermethylation. The now-established succinate-mediated “hypermethylator” phenotype was also recently shown to synergize with HIF2α in establishing a mesenchymal-like phenotype and enhancing the metastatic potential of SDHB-knockout mouse chromaffin cells in vivo. Yet, the hypermethylator phenotype of succinate accumulation was also found to sensitize complex II-deficient cancer cells to chemotherapy, as shown in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas following treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide. This was attributed to the decreased expression of the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) consequent to its promoter hypermethylation, as detected in patient SDHB-mutated paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma metastasis. Similar inhibition of DNA repair processes was reported for SDHB-deficient YUNK1 kidney cell lines as a result of histone lysine demethylase (KDM) inhibition. Deficiency in homologous recombination rendered SDHB-knockdown cells sensitive to synthetic lethality with poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor drugs olaparib and BMN-673, as shown both in vitro and in vivo, thus suggesting potential therapies for renal cell cancer (HLRCC). Taken together, these studies indicate that the succinate-induced hypermethylator phenotype acts as a double-edged sword in the physiopathology of cancers harboring SDH mutations, as it can either promote or inhibit cancer progression, depending on the genes targeted for methylation. 3.4. Metabolic Compensation Following Complex II Mutations Affecting OXPHOS 3.4.1. Preferential Usage of Glucose and Glutamine As complex II links the ETC to the TCA cycle, alterations of its functions expectedly result in important metabolic rewiring, found to support the bioenergetic needs of tumors. In particular, murine SDHB-deficient serous ovarian carcinoma cells were shown to exhibit an unbalanced TCA cycle, with low production of fumarate and malate, owing to high succinate levels. In addition, these complex II-deficient cells preferentially used glucose for anaerobic ATP production (through glycolysis) and glutamate for fueling the TCA cycle. Similar preferential incorporation of glutamine carbons in the TCA cycle has been reported in murine SDHB-knockout chromaffin cells. These data suggest that SDH-deficient cells rewire their central carbon metabolism through differential metabolite usage, with glucose as a source of ATP production and glutamine as a major fuel for the TCA cycle. 3.4.2. Dependence on Pyruvate Carboxylation In addition to its effects on glucose and glutamine metabolism, complex II deficiency leads to alterations in the metabolism of aspartate, a major precursor for non-essential amino acid, protein, and nucleotide biosynthesis. Seminal studies elegantly demonstrated that SDH-deficient cells use oxaloacetate, generated by pyruvate carboxylation, to produce aspartate, while wild-type cells rely on acetyl-CoA originating from pyruvate oxidation. These results suggest that SDH-deficient cells switch from pyruvate oxidation to carboxylation to sustain their aspartate anabolic needs. These data were further confirmed by the growth arrest of SDH-deficient cells following pyruvate carboxylation inhibition. Taken together, these results confirm previous studies on the role of the ETC for cell proliferation, owing to its support of the synthesis of aspartate. 3.4.3. CIIlow, an Energy Consumption Regulator An interesting study by the Neuzil team recently identified an alternative assembly of complex II, termed CIIlow, and composed only of the SDHA subunit. This CIIlow complex, detected in patients with SDHB-mutated paragangliomas, was linked to poor survival. Expression of CIIlow complex in SDHB-deficient cancer cells was associated with a decrease in de novo pyrimidine synthesis and cell proliferation along with an upregulation of catabolic and salvage pathways. The expression of such a CIIlow complex may thus result from the metabolic adaptation of SDHB-deficient cancer cells, which are less proliferative, but endowed with high invasive and metastatic capacities. 4. Role of Complex III of the ETC for Physiological Functions 4.1. Links between Complex III Activity in Treg Cells and Immune Function As developed above, the diverse complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC) have an essential role for the effective coupling of mitochondrial respiration and energy production. Nonetheless, the defective activity of ETC complexes can have further functional consequences that depend on mitochondria-produced metabolites and reach beyond mere mitochondrial activity. T regulatory (Treg) cells are a subset of CD4+ T cells characterized by a mitochondrial metabolism. Chandel and collaborators recently showed that the activity of complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase) of the ETC is needed for the immune suppressive function of Treg cells and that its ablation leads to fatal inflammatory disease in treated mice, through modified metabolite production. Mice whose Treg cells are deficient in complex III were generated, by deleting the gene encoding the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (RISP), one of its essential subunits. Although Treg cell proliferation and survival, as well as Foxp3 expression, were maintained in these mice, their immune suppressive capacity was lost. Increased concentrations of the 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and succinate metabolites, which are known inhibitors of the TET-family of DNA demethylases (Figure 3), were found responsible for the DNA hypermethylation phenotype, for the altered gene expression in Treg cells and, eventually, for the disruption of their immune suppressive function. 4.2. Links between Complex III Activity in Haematopoietic Stem Cells and Haematopoiesis Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) display a mainly glycolytic phenotype. However, the importance of HSC mitochondrial activity for hematopoiesis was demonstrated by the same team, by depleting complex III in murine fetal hematopoietic stem cells. As for RISP-null Treg cells, RISP-null fetal HSCs maintained their proliferation. However, HSC impaired respiration was accompanied by a decreased NAD+/NADH ratio and, as observed for RISP-null Treg cells, levels of the metabolites 2-hydroxyglutarate and succinate were increased, as that of fumarate. The functional consequences of RISP-dependent complex III depletion and the resulting unbalanced metabolite production were the inability of HSCs to generate multipotent progenitors, leading to mice anemia and fetal death. 4.3. Links between Complex III Activity in Endothelial Cells and Angiogenesis Endothelial cells (ECs) also primarily use glycolysis for ATP production, vessel sprouting, and angiogenesis. However, in addition to glucose that fuels glycolysis, endothelial cells can also take up fatty acids and glutamine that fuel the TCA cycle and, further, the ETC. By antimycin inhibition of complex III in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro, Chandel and collaborators showed that complex III is necessary for angiogenesis through the maintenance of NAD+/NADH ratios, aspartate concentrations, and proliferation of endothelial cells. These effects of a dysfunctional complex III in reducing NAD+/NADH ratios, proliferation, and angiogenesis were confirmed in vivo in mice harboring a deletion of the Uqcrq gene, encoding the ubiquinol-binding protein QPC, a critical subunit of complex III. They were accompanied by a loss of postnatal retinal and lung angiogenesis, as well as melanoma angiogenesis in a B16-F10 melanoma model. These studies highlighted the physiological consequences of a dysfunctional complex III of the mitochondrial ETC, for immunity, hematopoiesis, or angiogenesis. Some of these effects were linked to the overproduction of metabolites like 2-hydroxyglutarate and succinate, or fumarate, which interestingly appeared to be cell-type dependent, suggesting other levels of regulation. 5. Versatile Roles of Mitochondrial Components in Physiology and Disease 5.1. The Role of Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10), Activated by the Mevalonate Pathway, in Cancer Ubiquinone, also known as coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), is an important electron carrier located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it transfers electrons from complexes I and II to complex III of the electron transport chain (ETC) (Figure 1). Ubiquinone is thus involved in the regulation of oxidative stress and ROS production. Ubiquinone is also a downstream metabolite of the mevalonate pathway. The mevalonate pathway uses acetyl-CoA, derived from glucose, glutamine, and/or acetate metabolism, to produce mevalonate; farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP); and, thereafter, different metabolites including cholesterol and ubiquinone (Figure 4). The mevalonate pathway is often upregulated in cancers, which leads to increased mitochondrial concentrations of CoQ10. Statin inhibition of the mevalonate pathway is beneficial and statin treatment has been correlated with tumor cell apoptosis and reduced mortality in diverse cancers, notably breast cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. As shown for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor cells, ubiquinone levels are lowered by statin treatment, resulting in increased oxidative stress and ROS production. However, this oxidative stress triggers redox-active metabolic pathways aimed at lowering ROS levels, including the increased import of cystine for downstream glutathione production. Therefore, the dysfunctional role of ubiquinone in the mitochondria of PDAC cells can be addressed by the concomitant targeting of the upstream mevalonate pathway (with statins) and of the metabolic glutathione-based compensation of excessive ROS production (with cystine/glutamate xCT antiporter inhibitors). As demonstrated in PDAC murine models, this effective approach triggers cancer cell death while sparing the mitochondrial functions. 5.2. Changing Dogmas about the Mitochondrial Role of CPT1, in both Synthesis and Oxidation of Fatty Acids Lipids are important metabolites for membrane building and, therefore, for cell proliferation. They also provide cellular energy, act as signaling entities, and are involved in intercellular communication. All these functions allow lipid metabolism to contribute to cancer progression. Both activation of fatty acid (FA) synthesis and FA oxidation have been linked to cancer progression. As recently reviewed, enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation were overexpressed in diverse cancers and their inhibition was shown to curb cancer progression. Such is the case for CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1), a protein associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane, allowing the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix. CPT1-dependent transfer of long-chain acyl groups from coenzyme A to carnitine constitutes the rate-limiting enzymatic process for the oxidative degradation of fatty acids. However, CPT1 is now demonstrated to affect cancer cell proliferation by mechanisms relying on anabolic FA synthesis rather than FA β-oxidation (FAO). This novel role for CPT1 was uncovered by changing the tools to inhibit CPT1 activity. Instead of the etomoxir-dependent pharmacological inhibition of CPT1, CPT1 knock downs were performed. Studying the effects of CPT1 using high concentrations of etomoxir was marred by its off-target inhibition of complex I of the electron transport chain, a feature that was reported for the BT549 breast cancer cell line as well as for T cells. CPT1 knock down in the BT549 breast cancer cell line demonstrated the role of CPT1 for cell proliferation, independently of FAO. CPT1 was actually found necessary for mitochondrial morphology maintenance, regulated mitochondrial lipid levels, polarized mitochondrial membrane, and efficient respiratory chain coupling. As suggested by the authors, an important CPT1 function may thus be to provide long-chain fatty acids for anabolic processes in the mitochondria, needed for healthy cells and exploited in enhanced cancer cell proliferation. 5.3. Different Types of Mitochondria Linked to Lipid Metabolism Attributing both antagonistic functions of FA synthesis and FA oxidation to mitochondria might be counter-intuitive. However, the recently-reported existence of metabolically-distinct mitochondrial subpopulations—one endowed with FA oxidation activity, the other involved in lipid droplet formation—could reconcile these two different mitochondrial activities. A mitochondrial population associated with lipid droplets was characterized in brown adipose tissue (BAT). These peridroplet mitochondria (PDM) showed a high bioenergetic capacity that supported triacylglyceride (TAG) synthesis and lipid droplet formation. The protein composition of these mitochondria and the structure of their cristae appeared different from that of cytosolic mitochondria. They remained as an isolated pool different from cytosolic mitochondria owing to their low fusion-fission activity. In BAT cells isolated from cold-exposed mice, PDM abundance was reduced two fold in association with enhanced β-oxidation activity. Mitochondria recruitment to lipid droplets is not limited to BAT, as also reported in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in striated muscle upon nutrient deprivation, as reviewed by Benador et al.. Lipid droplet accumulation has been associated with therapy resistance for various cancers, including glioma, colon, kidney, lung, and prostate cancers. Whether PDM represent a population of mitochondria that can be targeted therapeutically in these pathologies will be worth investigating. 6. Mitochondria as Signaling Organelles: Functional Effects of Mitochondrial Exchange between Cells Mitochondria are known to act as signaling organelles owing to their production of reactive oxygen species, structural compounds, and metabolites. As described above, metabolites produced by the TCA cycle can be used for the biosynthesis of macromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides, as well as for epigenome modifications and post-translational protein changes. As a result, mitochondria regulate a wide range of biological functions, including survival, growth, and differentiation. However, the effects of mitochondria are not restricted to the cells that originally produced them, as we now know that, quite unexpectedly, mitochondria can translocate between cells. By their capacity to get transferred between cells, mitochondria can thus provide signaling cues to other cells. Numerous studies have now documented the diverse effects generated by intercellular mitochondria transfers and shown that they depend on the physiological/pathophysiological conditions and, more specifically, on the state of both mitochondria-provider and -recipient cells. The parts below provide an overview of the functional effects of intercellular mitochondria transfers in tissue repair, inflammation, and cancer progression, with a focus on the role of metabolites and structural compounds generated in the mitochondria-recipient cells. 6.1. Biological Effects of Intercellular Mitochondria Transfers The past two decades revealed that mitochondria constantly communicate with both the cytosol and the nucleus under normal and stress conditions, thus eliciting adaptive cellular biological responses. More recently, the concept that mitochondria could exert biological effects outside from their original cells emerged from the observation that whole mitochondria, or parts of mitochondria, can translocate from one cell to the other. One example of intercellular mitochondrial communication is provided by the crosstalk of dying cells, following tissue injury, with the innate immune system of recipient cells, through the release of mitochondrial molecules including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), N-formyl peptides, ATP, or cardiolipin. These mitochondrial products, recognized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by specific receptors on innate immune cells, are capable of directly activating the innate immune system and triggering adaptive inflammatory responses. In addition to the crosstalk mediated by mitochondrial fragments, cells have been shown to communicate with each other by exchanging whole mitochondria. Intercellular transfers of whole mitochondria have been reported to occur both in vitro and in vivo, and in both physiological and pathological conditions. This phenomenon is involved in several biological processes such as tissue repair, inflammation, and cancer progression (see reviews). Mitochondria can translocate from one cell to the other by different modalities. These include thin membrane channels called tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) that ensure the connection and the mitochondria transfer between mitochondria-donor and -acceptor cells. Mitochondria can also be transferred through their release in the extracellular space, either encapsulated inside microvesicles or as free organelles. Importantly, the biological effects promoted by intercellular mitochondria transfers are highly dependent on the state of both mitochondria-donor and mitochondria-recipient cells. The outcome of these transfers can be beneficial, for instance, in tissue healing; on the other hand, they can also enhance tumor progression. The vast majority of the studies addressing the process of intercellular mitochondria transfers have been conducted on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as donor or acceptor cells for the conveyed mitochondria. These studies revealed that, compared with other cells, MSCs demonstrate a high capacity to donate their mitochondria to neighboring cells. This capacity is attributed to high expression of Miro-1, an outer mitochondrial membrane Rho-GTPase that mediates mitochondria trafficking through TNTs. Mitochondria donation from MSCs to damaged or cancer cells has invariably been shown to improve recipient cell survival (see reviews). Therefore, this process has important consequences in tissue regeneration and in cancer progression and aggressiveness (resistance to chemotherapy). MSCs have also been reported to transfer mitochondria to immune cells including T cells and macrophages. In these settings, transferred mitochondria decreased inflammation by promoting recipient immune cell differentiation towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. On the contrary, the transfer to T cells of mitochondria originating from myeloid cells was shown to exacerbate inflammation and to lead to asthma aggravation. In addition, mitochondria transfer from pro-inflammatory monocytes to endothelial cells was associated with vessel inflammation observed in cardiovascular diseases. It is worth mentioning that intercellular mitochondria transfers can be bidirectional, eliciting distinct biological responses in the two communicating cells. For instance, and as mentioned above, MSCs can transfer mitochondria to damaged cells, which results in improved survival. However, MSCs can also acquire mitochondria released from damaged cells. These mitochondria function as signaling organelles that alert MSCs of a danger situation and trigger an adaptive wound-healing response. The presence in the bloodstream of free or membrane-encapsulated respiratory-competent mitochondria has also been recently reported. Although the biological impact of these circulating mitochondria has yet to be determined, a role in regulating systemic inflammation through their interactions with immune cells could be speculated. This pro-inflammatory role of circulating mitochondria is supported by observations made in organs from deceased patients and used for allotransplantation. In particular, circulating whole mitochondria and mtDNA levels were strongly correlated with the inflammation initiated by neutrophil activation and early allograft dysfunction, as shown for liver transplantation. Besides, the concentration of free mitochondria in the blood of cancer patients correlated with metastasis, suggesting that circulating mitochondria are involved in cancer cell-to-cell communication processes. 6.2. OXPHOS Induced by Mitochondria Transfer in Tissue Repair and Cancer The first discovered biological effect assigned to intercellular mitochondria transfers was their capacity to improve the survival of recipient cells, either damaged following a stress injury or, for cancer cells, treated by chemotherapy. Increased recipient cell survival was invariably correlated with enhanced OXPHOS activity and ATP production. The most convincing proof of the importance of functional OXPHOS restoration in the mitochondria-recipient cells was provided by studies using, as either mitochondria-donor or -recipient cells, ρ0 cells, which are devoid of mtDNA and have an impaired respiratory chain. The pioneering work of Prockop and collaborators thus demonstrated the OXPHOS activity restoration in ρ0 A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells owing to mitochondria transfer from cocultivated MSCs. Likewise, Neuzil and collaborators found that mitochondria transfer occurred in vivo, from host stroma cells to engrafted ρ0 melanoma or ρ0 breast cancer cells, and that this process fully restored the respiration in the acceptor ρ0 cancer cells. Beside the studies conducted with ρ0 cells, many works reported that mitochondria are transferred during cocultures from MSCs to damaged cells, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, bronchial epithelial cells, corneal epithelial cells, and neuronal cells, or with leukemic, bladder, and breast cancer cells. In addition, the physiological relevance of this process was strengthened by the in vivo demonstration of an increase in OXPHOS activity and ATP production following mitochondria transfer from mouse lung alveolar epithelial cells injured through exposure to LPS, to rotenone, or to cigarette smoke. Finally, the prerequisite for transferred mitochondria to harbor functional respiration in order to exert their cytoprotective effects was reinforced by using ρ0 MSCs, which were unable to protect damaged cells against apoptosis. 6.3. Metabolic Reprogramming of MSCs and Cancer Cells by Metabolites Supplied by Mitochondra Transfer As mentioned above, the acquisition of functional mitochondria leads to the enhancement of OXPHOS activity and ATP production in mitochondria-recipient cells. This process is of critical importance in damaged and dying cells owing to the role of ATP in restoring cellular bioenergetics. Beyond its impact on ATP levels, OXPHOS activation may also reflect an activation of the TCA cycle with an increased generation of some metabolites, with the OXPHOS and the TCA cycle being tightly coordinated. It is still poorly documented to what extent intercellular mitochondria transfers contribute to the metabolic reprogramming of recipient cells through enhanced production of TCA cycle metabolites. However, two recent works demonstrated that TCA cycle metabolites are involved in the signaling mediated by the transferred mitochondria in recipient cancer cells and MSCs. As shown by Neuzil’s group, ρ0 melanoma and breast cancer cells lacking functional OXPHOS were unable to form tumors in mice. However, acquisition of respiratory-competent mitochondria from stromal cells allowed these ρ0 malignant cells to become highly proliferative, leading to tumor formation and progression. Mechanistically, the authors demonstrated that OXPHOS-mediated ATP production was not required for tumor progression, but that, instead, OXPHOS function was critical for the generation of orotate, which is an essential intermediate for pyrimidine de novo synthesis. In particular, OXPHOS restoration in ρ0 cells was found to re-activate the enzymatic activity of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which is the ubiquinone-oxidoreductase responsible for orotate formation through dihydroorotate oxidation (Figure 1). As pyrimidine serves as building blocks for DNA replication and transcription, this explains why restoration of OXPHOS in ρ0 cells is essential to sustain cell proliferation. In the absence of a functional respiratory chain, as is the case in ρ0 cells prior to intercellular mitochondria transfers, DHODH is unable to oxidize dihydroorotate, thus blocking pyrimidine synthesis and, as a result, arresting DNA replication and cell division. Another example of the role of TCA cycle metabolites in mediating the effects of exogenous mitochondria is provided by recent observations from our laboratory indicating that the respiratory-competent mitochondria released by activated platelets can be engulfed by MSCs and can stimulate the MSC pro-angiogenic activity. Citrate levels were increased in MSCs following platelet mitochondria transfer. Citrate was identified as a key metabolite initiating metabolic remodeling and functional alterations in recipient MSCs. Citrate was shown to stimulate recipient MSCs through its export to the cytosol where it fueled the ATP citrate lyase enzyme (ACLY), leading to the activation of fatty acid synthesis (Figure 4) and, subsequently, to the stimulation of the angiogenic activity of MSCs. 6.4. Role of DAMPs, Generated by the Transfer of Damaged Mitochondria, in Regulating Inflammation and MSC Activation Following tissue injury, damaged cells have been reported to release their mitochondria to the extracellular environment. As discussed below, the translocation of these damaged mitochondria to target cells, such as immune cells or reparative progenitors cells, functions as signaling cues, able to alert the rest of the body of a danger situation. In contrast to the above-mentioned studies where transferred mitochondria needed to be fully functional to behave as pro-survival factors or as metabolite suppliers, mitochondria transferred from suffering cells mediate their effects by the means of mitochondrial fragments or DAMPs generated by recipient cells. Several DAMPs produced by recipient cells following the intercellular transfer of damaged mitochondria have been involved in inflammation. One example is provided by the role of mitochondria released by activated platelets to neutrophils in the stimulation of the innate immune system. Following their engulfment by neutrophils, platelet-derived mitochondria have been shown to have their membranes hydrolyzed by the phospholipase A2 enzyme, this mitochondria degradation leading to the production of various DAMPs, including lysophospholipids, fatty acids, and mtDNA, which are known to trigger leukocyte activation to have their membranes hydrolyzed by the phospholipase A2 enzyme. More recently, Zhu and colleagues reported that both apoptotic and necrotic cells released whole mitochondria in the extracellular compartment. Strikingly, the authors observed that the mitochondria released by the two types of dying cells did not support the same systemic effects following their internalization in cultivated macrophages, with mitochondria from apoptotic cells generating more inflammation than those derived from necrotic cells. Mechanistically, cardiolipin was identified, in the recipient macrophages, as the DAMP responsible for the activation of the inflammasome, a multi-protein complex able to detect danger signals and to trigger the secretion of the pro-inflammatory IL-1α and IL-18 cytokines. How mitochondrial cardiolipin exerts its pro-inflammatory effects in these settings remains to be formally demonstrated. One possible explanation suggested by the authors is that the mitochondrial cardiolipin was externalized from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane in the apoptotic mitochondria. This conformational change would allow the binding of cardiolipin to the inflammasome sensor NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3), as previously reported. Besides their role as pro-inflammatory mediators, mitochondria released by damaged cells can also be involved in tissue repair processes, following an injury. In particular, we recently reported that the mitochondria transfer from apoptotic endothelial or cardiac cells to MSCs constitutes a signaling messenger that triggers a cytoprotective response in the recipient MSCs, consisting of the enhanced donation of mitochondria by MSCs towards damaged cells to rescue them. Interestingly, this study underlined that two DAMPs, namely reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heme, mediate the effects of damaged mitochondria in the recipient MSCs. These two DAMPS are involved at different levels of the cascade of events leading to the activation of the MSCs. First, our findings indicated that the ROS produced by damaged cells are critical regulators of the transfer of the mitochondria from the damaged cells towards MSCs, as the use of ROS scavenger abrogated both the mitochondrial transfer from the injured cells to the MSCs and the resulting MSC rescuing function. The role of ROS signaling as modulator of mitochondria transfer and its associated effects have also been reported in the context of cancer, between leukemic cells and bone marrow-derived MSCs. The molecular mechanisms whereby mitochondrial ROS produced by injured cells activate the cytoprotective functions of MSCs remain to be fully investigated. However, one possible mechanism is that ROS produced in excess by damaged mitochondria are sensed by MSCs as the signal triggering the degradation of dysfunctional organelles, as previously reported in other experimental settings. The second DAMP involved in the activation of the recipient MSCs was the mitochondrial heme, released in the cytosol following the degradation of the transferred damaged mitochondria. In response to the increased level of cytosolic free heme, which has powerful pro-oxidant and toxic capacities, MSCs were found to enhance their expression of the heme oxygenase I (HO-1) enzyme to catalyze the degradation of heme, thus showing the role of HO-1 signaling in the stimulation of the pro-healing properties of MSCs. 7. Mitochondria and Microbiota: Two Sources of Metabolites for Cell Metabolism and Functions 7.1. Endosymbiotic Origin of the Mitochondria Mitochondria and their host eukaryotic cells have a now well-documented endosymbiotic history showing the bacterial origin of the mitochondria. Over time, this endosymbiosis resulted in gene transfers between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. As described above, this concerns the genes encoding the various subunits of the complexes of the electron transport chain, which are found in both the nucleus and the mitochondria. Many other mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus, translated in the cytoplasm, and transported to mitochondria where they exert their biological functions. Reciprocally, through the metabolites they produce, mitochondria have the capacity to exert retrograde controls on nuclear gene expression. Such is the case for alpha-ketoglutarate, 2-hydroxyglutarate, succinate, and fumarate, which regulate nuclear gene expression via the activity of DNA demethylases (Figure 3). 7.2. Role of the Gut Microbiota in Physiology and Disease Bacteria are actually present in mammals, in particular in their gut. The complex set of bacteria constituting the gut microbiota provides essential functions for the host mammalian body, as shown by numerous publications in this rapidly evolving area of research. Its effects are not restricted to organs located near the gut, but extended to all organs as shown by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) of samples collected from 29 organs from either germ-free (GF) or specific-pathogens-free (SPF) mice. The gut microbiota contributes to metabolically balanced physiological conditions, including the regulation of the immune system. The gut microbiota was found to alter the efficacy of immunotherapies based on the blockade of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1). These immune effects were observed for cancers whose primary sites were distant from the gut, like melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In NSCLC and RCC patients, the presence of Akkermansia muciniphila in their gut microbiota was associated to a better response to PD-1 blockade. Santoni and collaborators proposed that the role of A. muciniphila in promoting an immune response to anti PD-1 treatment could be attributed to the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), mainly acetate and propionate, produced by these bacteria. These SCFAs can activate the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRCs), GPR41 and GPR43, with expected downstream effects on both cancer cell apoptosis and immune response. The composition of the gut microbiota has also been recently tightly linked to malignancies. While the interaction of fecal bacteria with human colorectal cancers was expected, much less expected was the persistent association of bacteria like Fusobacterium nucleatum and its associated gram-negative microbiota with the colon cancer metastatic cells, at sites distant from the primary tumor. This was the case, for instance, for metastases in liver, which was associated with tumor progression. As pointed out by the authors, the findings that the bacteria Fusobacterium travel with the primary tumor cells to their metastatic sites suggest that tumor microbiota might constitute an essential component of the tumor microenvironment. 7.3. Role of the Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) Secreted by the Microbiota Outside from physiological conditions, the gut microbiota can also either support or mitigate the metabolic functions of mammalian cells, in pathological conditions or when under metabolic stress. A lot of the effects of the microbiota, through its secreted metabolites, actually go through the functioning of their “distant cousins, the mitochondria” as recently reviewed by Agrawal and collaborators. An important part of the metabolites circulating in mammals are not produced by the mitochondria-containing mammalian cells, but instead originate from the commensal bacteria found in the gut. These microbiota metabolites are mainly produced through the bacterial metabolism of dietary products and host molecules. These microbiota metabolites include lactate and the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, propionate, and butyrate, in roughly a 3:1:1 ratio. They provide the means for the metabolic interactions between the gut microbiota and the human host and play a key role for the overall metabolism in physiological and pathological conditions, as well as for the response to therapy treatments. Acetate can be processed to acetyl-CoA through the enzymatic activity of the nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2). The overexpression of ACSS2 was observed in diverse cancers including glioblastoma and brain metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast and colorectal cancers and correlated with tumor progression both in humans and in murine models. ACSS2-dependant production of Acetyl-CoA is used by the cells for lipid synthesis and acetylation of histones. Therefore, as expected, high levels of acetyl-CoA lead to the increased acetylation of histones and, consequently, to the expression of genes, including those involved in cell growth. When nutrients are fully available, the acetyl-CoA comes primarily from the citrate produced from the TCA cycle in the mitochondria. However, in glioblastoma and brain metastases, the amount of the acetyl-CoA originating from acetate and feeding in the TCA cycle was substantially increased. As shown by Gottlieb and collaborators, acetate can be processed to acetyl-CoA in conditions of low oxygen and low lipid concentrations, and thus can provide an alternative carbon source for the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. In these metabolically stressed conditions, the upregulated expression of ACSS2 was responsible for cancer cell growth and survival by increasing lipid biomass. Therefore, there too, the acetate produced by the gut microbiota is expected to play a determinant role in supporting lipid biosynthesis and cancer progression. 7.4. Role of Other Microbiota-Secreted Metabolites Outside from the SCFA major classes of microbiota-secreted metabolites, other metabolites produced by the gut bacteria from dietary products can influence the host cell metabolism. Such is the case for isovanillic acid 3-O-sulfate (IVAS), a metabolite produced by the microbiota upon consumption of the cyanidin 3-O-glucoside found in berries and that is detected in the blood. Houghton and coworkers showed that this compound increased the uptake of glucose and the metabolism of the differentiated human skeletal muscle myoblast line LHCN-M2 through an increased concentration and activity of the glucose transporter GLUT4, along with an activated PI3K/AKT signaling.",8087

33865346,"Background Hallmarks of cancer include genome instability and alterations in metabolism, for the latter of which mitochondria are key regulators. Mitochondria are semiautonomous eukaryotic organelles that are considered as cellular energy powerhouses. They consist of thousands of proteins, mainly encoded by the nuclear genome, but also 13 encoded by their own genome. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a small circular DNA of 16,569 bp, which codes for 2 rRNAs (12S and 16S), 22 tRNAs, and protein subunits for four of the five complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), namely seven subunits of NADH dehydrogenase (complex I), one of cytochrome c reductase (complex III), three of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) and two of ATP synthase (complex V). The four subunits of respiratory enzyme complex II are totally encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA), and are transcribed and translated in the cytoplasm and then transported into the mitochondria. The displacement-loop region (D-loop) is a long noncoding region of mtDNA approximately 1.1 kbp long and contains regulatory sequences for replication and transcription. A number of proteins are implicated in the replication and transcription of mtDNA, and mitochondrial transcriptional factor A (TFAM) plays dual roles in these biological processes through its binding to D-loop. The number of mitochondria that exist in a human cell ranges from hundreds to thousands, and each mitochondrion contains 2–10 mtDNA copies. The synthesis and degradation of mtDNA is rapid and independent of the cell cycle so the dynamic equilibrium between the two processes determines the mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) (reviewed in Ref.). MtDNAcn is strictly regulated during differentiation, and normal healthy cells with a high demand for ATP generation via OXPHOS have higher mtDNAcn than cells with a low ATP requirement. The OXPHOS system is implicated in many cellular processes such as cell communication, differentiation and apoptosis. Consequently, OXPHOS dysfunction can lead to the development of several human diseases, including cancers. For example, mutations in nuclear genes that encode the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, MRC complex II) subunits can alter corresponding subunit structure and consequently affect MRC complex II activity, substrate levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell redox state, which in turn activates oncogenic transcription factors to regulate expression of target genes and stimulate cancer cell proliferation. To date, mitochondrial dysfunction and various mtDNA alterations including point mutations, deletions and copy number changes have been observed in several human cancers such as breast, colon, stomach, kidney, thyroid, head and neck and ovarian cancers, and some linked with clinical parameters. A total of 635 mutations have been reported in the D-loop region, including 510 point mutations, 56 deletions and 69 insertions. Additional mutations have been identified in the coding regions: 593 mutations in the complex I subunits, 343 mutations in the complex III, IV and V subunits, and 165 mutations in the tRNA and rRNA genes. An increased mtDNAcn has been observed in endometrial, untreated head and neck, prostate, pancreatic and colorectal cancers compared to normal cells. On the contrary, a decrease of mtDNAcn has been associated with renal, thyroid, breast, previously treated head and neck, hepatic and ovarian cancers compared to normal cells. While mtDNA alterations such as mutations and changes in mtDNAcn are commonplace in cancers compared to normal cells, much more needs to be learnt about how they interrelate with each other and how they associate with underlying biological processes, including ROS production and ROS-mediated drug response. Mitochondria are considered a primary intracellular site of ROS generation via OXPHOS during ATP generation. ROS play important roles in cell signalling pathways such as growth, differentiation, metabolism and apoptotic cell death signalling (reviewed in Ref.). ROS have been purported to have a double-edged-sword effect in cancer cells since low levels of ROS can play a critical role in promoting cell proliferation and invasion, whereas excessive levels of ROS can cause oxidative damage to intracellular bio-macromolecules and consequently induce cell death (reviewed in Ref.). This makes cancer cells vulnerable to agents that further increase ROS levels, e.g. cisplatin (CDDP) that has been reported to cause excessive accumulation of ROS resulting in cytotoxic effect in various types of cancer such as ovarian cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer. The mitochondria-targeting compound, dequalinium chloride (DQA), has also been reported to demonstrate potent anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo in different malignancies due to the resulting damage to mtDNA and the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I rendering elevated ROS generation. DQA belongs to a group of chemical agents knows as delocalised lipophilic cations (DLCs). Positively charged DLCs are drawn into mitochondria in response to the negative electric potential across the mitochondrial membrane. More importantly, the difference in mitochondrial transmembrane potential between normal and cancer cells can cause a ten-fold increase in DLC accumulation in cancer cells compared to their normal counterparts (reviewed in Ref.), making the targeted mitochondrial accumulation of DLCs an attractive approach to cancer-specific therapy. Our previous study confirmed observations by other groups that DLCs such as DQA preferentially target mitochondria in cancer cells. Furthermore, DQA may afford enhanced drug efficacy with reduced side effects due to its cancer-specific targeting property compared to non-cancer-specific / nucleus-targeting compounds such as CDDP, even though both DQA and CDDP induce ROS production. The main objectives of our ongoing research are to prove the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondria via DLCs in treating cancer and to identify effective biomarkers (such as ROS and specific mtDNA variations) that can predict drug response. Our previous study revealed a positive correlation between baseline intracellular ROS levels and drug response in human cancer cell lines. Therefore, baseline ROS levels have been proposed as a novel biomarker to predict drug sensitivity. However, since measuring ROS in tissues is technically challenging, a more straightforward, e.g. genetic, biomarker to indicate the response to ROS-stimulating agents was sought. Due to the complexity of the pathways for cancer development and resistance, which involves the functional cross-talk of mtDNA genes and their related nuclear genes, it is challenging to prove direct links between mtDNA variations and phenotype, one reason being the absence of routine laboratory methods for the genetic manipulation of mammalian mtDNA. However, one way of proving a link is to demonstrate a corresponding mitochondrial/cellular effect in cells/tissues that contain the mtDNA variation. However, more than one nuclear or mitochondrial variation may be present, potentially confounding the interpretation. Recently, we have demonstrated that 3D structural analysis of mitochondrial proteins in silico can complement the former approach revealing detailed mechanistic insights into the functional role of variations within mtDNA encoded-OXPHOS genes. Consequently, the present study aimed to explore the interrelationship between various mitochondrial genetic abnormalities (mtDNA variations and mtDNAcn change), baseline intracellular ROS levels and sensitivity to ROS-stimulating drugs such as CDDP and DQA within the same panel of cell lines employed in our previous study. Here we show that mtDNAcn and the total number of non-synonymous variations within the mitochondrial genome have a strong correlation with both baseline ROS level and drug resistance. 3D structural modelling of these reveals a subset of variations that could be responsible for the observed mtDNA genotype-mitochondrial/cellular phenotype links. While repeating these experiments with the different mtDNAs on a standardised nuclear genetic background is warranted, we propose that this is a useful first step in the characterisation of the cancer cell lines, and reveals a subset of variations that have the potential to be used to stratify patient into subgroups that are most likely to benefit from ROS-stimulating agents in the future. Results Baseline intracellular ROS, mitochondrial superoxide and drug response levels Intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide levels were measured using two fluorescence-labelled probes, DCFDA and MitoSOX, respectively. Results from those assays indicated that the cancer cell lines had increased baseline intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide levels compared to the non-cancerous cells (PNT-2) (Fig. 1a & b). Amongst the cancer cell lines, Caco-2 had the highest baseline intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide levels whereas Ishikawa had the lowest. Drug sensitivity levels towards CDDP and DQA were evaluated for all cell lines by calculating their IC50s. Data in Fig. 1c & d show that the non-cancerous PNT-2 cells were more sensitive to both drugs compared to the cancer cells with Caco-2 being the most resistant whereas Ishikawa the most sensitive amongst the cancer cells, although in terms of the DQA treatment, PNT-2 was not significantly more sensitive compared to Ishikawa (Fig. 1a).  Mitochondrial genetic profiles Relative quantification of mtDNAcn was performed using the SYBR Green PCR technique. The results showed that cancer cell lines also had increased mtDNAcn compared to the non-cancerous cells. Amongst the cancer cell lines, Caco-2 had the highest baseline mtDNAcn whereas Ishikawa had the lowest (Fig. 2a). The complete mitochondrial genome of each cell line was PCR amplified via 17 overlapping amplicons and the PCR products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (a representative gel image is shown in Figure S1). Sequencing data revealed that the total number of mtDNA variations in each cancer cell line was comparable (30, 25, 26 and 36 variations in Ishikawa, MDA-MB-231, PC-3 and Caco-2, respectively). However, these numbers were significantly higher than that in the non-cancerous cell line (PNT-2), in which only 9 variations were identified (Fig. 2b).  Variations within the D-loop region were identified and Ishikawa, PC-3 and Caco-2 showed greater numbers of variations in this region compared to PNT-2 and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2c). The sequencing data revealed that the D-loop region was a hotspot for variations identified in the present study. Numerous common variations amongst the cancer cell lines were observed in the D-loop region (summarised in Table S1). Our results indicated that A73G was detected in Ishikawa, PC-3 and Caco-2; T195C was identified only in MDA-MB-231 and PC-3; A263G was a common variation in all the cancer cell lines; 310InsC was observed only in Ishikawa, PC-3 and MDA-MB-231; T16172C was detected in Ishikawa and PC-3; C16261T occurred in Ishikawa and Caco-2. None of the common variations seen in the cancer cells was detected in the non-cancerous cell line (PNT-2). On the other hand, each cell line harboured a number of unique variations in the D-loop region (listed in Table S2). 513InsCA, G16319A, T16325C and T16519C were found only in the PNT-2 cells; C150T, C338T, C16223T, C16257A, T16304C and A16497G were found only in Ishikawa; A153G was found only in MDA-MB-231; T195C, C16192T, C16256T, C16270T, C16320T and A16399G were found only in PC-3; G47A, G185A, G228A, C295T, C462T, T489C, C16069T and T16126C were found only in Caco-2. Progressive increases in the number of non-synonymous point variations in the protein coding regions (2, 4, 5, 6, 11) were observed in PNT-2, Ishikawa, MDA-MB-231, PC-3 and Caco-2, respectively (Fig. 2d). The same trend was observed for non-synonymous point variations in complexes I and III (1, 3, 4, 5 and 9 variations) (Fig. 2e), but not complexes IV and V (Fig. 2f). Numerous common non-synonymous variations among the cell lines were observed within the mitochondrial genome (Table S1). Our results indicated that the A8860G variation was detected in all the cell lines whereas C14766T was detected only in the cancer cells. G13708A was identified only in the PC-3 and Caco-2 cells, whereas A15326G was a common variation in the PNT-2, Ishikawa, MDA-MB-231 and Caco-2 cells. On the contrary, greater numbers of unique non-synonymous variations, mainly in complexes I and III, were observed in the cancer cells (Table S2). The T3394C point variation was found only in the Ishikawa cells; C12084T and A13966G were found only in the MDA-MB-231 cells; T11120C, C13802T and A14793G were found only in the PC-3 cells. Caco-2 had the highest number of unique variations including T4216C, G7977C, A10398G, A13681G, T14798C, A14927G and C15452A. No unique variations within complexes I and III were found in the non-cancerous cells (PNT-2). Positive correlations between cellular and genetic parameters In order to investigate how mitochondrial genetic abnormalities might affect the baseline ROS level and drug response in the cancer cells, linear regression was employed to model the relationship between the redox statuses and CDDP/DQA IC50s. The relationship between these cellular parameters and each of the following genetic parameters: mtDNAcn, total variations, D-loop variations, non-synonymous variations, and complexes I/III non-synonymous variations, was also investigated. Baseline intracellular ROS levels were positively correlated with the resistance levels to both drugs in the cell lines (Fig. 3a & b), confirming our previous observations. Positive correlations between mtDNAcn and intracellular ROS, mitochondrial superoxide (Fig. 3c & d), and resistance levels to both drugs (Fig. 3e & f) in the cell lines were also observed between the cell lines.  Data in Fig. 3g & h show that numbers of variations in the complex I and III coding regions were positively correlated with the overall ROS and mitochondrial superoxide levels. Those non-synonymous variation numbers were also positively correlated with the IC50s of both CDDP and DQA (Fig. 3i & j). Similarly, numbers of non-synonymous variations identified in the coding regions for all the mitochondrial OXPHOS subunits were also positively correlated with intracellular ROS, mitochondrial superoxide and CDDP/DQA IC50s (data not shown). Neither the D-loop variations or total number of variations correlated with ROS levels, drug sensitivity or mtDNAcn (Fig. S2 & 3). These findings indicate that the following parameters, mtDNAcn, total non-synonymous variations and non-synonymous variations in complexes I/III, could serve as biomarkers for ROS levels and ROS-stimulating drug resistance. Eight functional variations identified in complexes I and III There were 17 non-synonymous and 20 synonymous variations identified in complexes I, III, IV and V. Amongst the complex I variations, 9 were non-synonymous substitutions, of which 2 were located in MT-ND1, 1 in MT-ND3, 2 in MT-ND4 and 4 in MT-ND5. As to the complex III variations, 6 MT-CYB substitutions were identified in total. For the remaining 2 non-synonymous variations, 1 substitution was found in complex IV affecting MT-COII and 1 substitution was identified in the MT-ATP6 subunit of complex V. The 3D structural analysis revealed that of the 17 non-synonymous variations identified within the mtDNA protein-coding regions, 8 were predicted to be functional, all in complex I (A10398G (T114A), T11120C (F121L), C12084T (S442F), A13681G (T449A), G13708A (A458T), C13802T (T489M), A13966G (T544A)) and complex III (T14798C (F18L)). No functional variations were predicted in complexes IV and V. None of the variations predicted to be functional were found in the non-cancerous PNT-2 cells. All the non-synonymous variations and their structural modelling predictions are summarised in Table 1.  Figure 4, 5 and 6 depict the structural consequences of the complex I and III variations predicted to be functional. The A10398G mutation, presents in Caco-2 with the highest baseline ROS and drug IC50, could cause the disruption of complex I assembly and stability by affecting the association of MT-ND1 and MT-ND3. The replacement of T114 by A114 removes the polar sidechain property of threonine, which is likely to affect the formation of hydrogen bonds with the MT-ND1 residue (N382) and weaken the interaction between the two subunits, and consequently affect the assembly of the two subunits and the stability of complex I (Fig. 4). Similarly, the A13681G, C13802T and A13966G variations, present in Caco-2, PC-3 and MDA-MB-231 respectively, cause the disruption of MT-ND5 subunit stability due to the loss of the hydrogen bonds formed between the residues within the subunit. Consequently, these variations are all predicted to weaken the interaction within the subunit, hence affect the stability of complex I.  The C12084T mutation, presents in MD-MB-231, results in the disruption of MT-ND4 stability. This variation replaces serine with phenylalanine (a larger amino acid) at position 442 (S442F) which is unlikely to be accommodated within the structure. Apart from being of a larger size, this phenylalanine at position 442 may disrupt and repel another phenylalanine nearby within the MT-ND4 subunit (i.e. F438) and consequently affect the stability of complex I (Fig. 5). Similarly, the T11120C variation in PC-3 and G13708A variation in PC-3 and Caco-2 cause the disruption of the MT-ND4 and MT-ND5 subunits respectively due to the lack of accommodation capacity for the newly formed residues. These intra-subunit disruptions could interfere with the stabilisation of the MT-ND4 and MT-ND5 subunits and consequently affect the stability of complex I. Complex III is at the centre of the OXPHOS system and the MT-CYB subunit lies at the centre of dimeric complex III containing two haems and two inhibitor binding sites, the Qo and Qi sites. T14798C in Caco-2 that results in the amino acid change F18L is located at the ubiquinone-binding site (i.e. the Qi site) of the MT-CYB subunit. Phenylalanine (F) is one of the residues that form the entrance of the Qi site of complex III. Both phenylalanine (F) and leucine (L) are hydrophobic. However, they differ in their side chains. Leucine does not have an aromatic side chain, which makes it smaller than phenylalanine. Therefore, this substitution is likely to alter the shape and size of the Qi site because it results in a larger cavity at the entrance to the site (Fig. 6). Such a change may interfere with the binding and dissociation of ubiquinone, the Qi site ligand, and consequently the electron transfer from heme bH. On the contrary, nine variations were predicted to be non-functional. These were: T3394C (Y30H) and T4216C (Y304H) in complex I; C14766T (T7I), A14793G (H16R), A14927G (T61A), A15326G (T194A) and C15452A (L236I) in complex III; G7977C (G131A) in complex IV; A8860G (T112A) in complex V. The structural analysis revealed that all those residues were distal from any known electron or proton route or major catalytic sites, and did not have any direct interaction with amino acids from neighbouring mitochondrial or nuclear subunits. There also appeared to be sufficient room to accommodate the amino acid change in each case. The combined effect of individual non-synonymous variations predicted to be functional in our study by 3D structural modelling is expected to be magnified if more than one is present in a cell/cell line, and so it is noteworthy that there was a positive correlation between the number of non-synonymous variations in complexes I and III predicted to be functional with the overall ROS and mitochondrial superoxide levels, and CDDP/DQA IC50s (Fig. 7). This finding suggests that an increasing number of non-synonymous variations predicted to have an effect on the structure and function of complexes I and III could provide a mechanistic link to the other effects observed, i.e. associated increase in ROS, drug resistance and mtDNAcn.  This can also be illustrated by comparing the cancerous PC-3 and non-cancerous PNT-2 cell lines, both of which originated from prostate tissue. Clearly, all the parameters, including baseline intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide levels, CDDP and DQA resistance, mtDNA copy number, total number of variations, total number of D-loop variations, total number of non-synonymous point mutations in protein coding regions and in complexes I and III, are elevated in PC-3 compared to PNT-2. Furthermore, it is worth noticing that the PC-3 cells contains three variations predicted to be functional (C13802T, G13708A, and T11120C), whereas the PNT-2 cells do not contain any. Varying frequency in healthy tissues and heritability of functional variations Among the subset of 8 variations classified as functional, only three: A10398G, G13708A and T14798C occur frequently in healthy tissues, i.e. more than 500 in 30,000 (1.6%) of complete mitochondrial genomes in at least 2 out 3 of the consulted databases (Table S3). On the other hand, 5 of the functional variations: A13966G, T11120C, C12084T, A13681G and C13802T as well as the D-loop variation 310InsC occur rarely in healthy tissues, i.e. less than 1.6% of the complete mitochondrial genomes in at least 2 out of 3 of the databases consulted (Table S3). A MitoMAP search of the subset of the 8 functional variations and 310IncC revealed that 5 have not been previously reported as either somatic or inherited variations, i.e. they are of unknown heritability (T11120C, C12084T, A13681G, C13802T, and 310InsC); three have been reported as somatic or inherited (A10398G, G13708A and T14798C), and one has been reported as inherited (A13966G) (Table S3). While our results indicate that variations occurring at low frequencies in healthy tissues are more likely to be previously unreported variations of potential functional importance, the possibility that previously reported somatic or inherited variations occurring at high frequencies in healthy tissues could also play a role in increased baseline ROS level, drug resistance and mtDNAcn cannot be ruled out.",3364
27161322,"INTRODUCTION Hypertension is a major global public health problem, affecting approximately 1 billion people worldwide, including 265 million adults in China. Hypertension as a polygenic, multifactorial, and highly heterogeneous disorder could be caused by single-gene or multifactorial conditions resulting from interactions between environmental and inherited risk factors. In particular, mitochondria can regulate various aspects of vascular function, thereby being critical for the pathogenesis of hypertension. The maternal transmission of hypertension reported in several studies further supports mitochondrial involvement in hypertension. The human mitochondrial genome (mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA) encodes 13 subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system, 2 rRNAs, and 22 tRNAs required for mitochondrial protein synthesis. Among these tRNAs, 8 tRNAs, such as tRNAGlu and tRNAA1a, reside on the cytosine-rich light (L) strand; the remaining tRNAs, including tRNALys and tRNAHis, are located on the guanine-rich heavy (H) strand. Mitochondrial tRNA genes were proposed to be the hot spots for mutations associated with cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. These hypertension-associated tRNA mutations were the tRNAIle 4263A → G and 4295A → G mutations and the tRNAMet 4435A → G and 4401A → G mutations in the junction of the tRNAMet and tRNAGln genes. These mutations have structural and functional consequences, including the processing of RNA precursors, nucleotide modification, and aminoacylation. The m.4263A → G and m.4401A → G (where “m” indicates mitochondrial sequence) mutations altered the processing of corresponding tRNA precursors, catalyzed by RNase P, while the m.4295A → G and m.4435A → G mutations may affect the nucleotide modification at position 37, at the 3′ end adjacent to this position of the tRNAIle and tRNAMet. However, the pathophysiology of these tRNA mutations remains poorly understood. Thus, it is necessary to establish the link between hypertension and mitochondrial dysfunction and their cause/effect relation. As part of a genetic screening program for hypertension in a cohort of 2,070 Han Chinese hypertensive subjects, we identified the T-to-C transition at position 5655 (5655A → G) at the 5′ end of the tRNAAla gene in three genetically unrelated probands whose families exhibited a maternal transmission of hypertension (see the supplemental material). As shown in Fig. 1, the m.5655A → G mutation was located at the processing site for the tRNA 5′ end precursors, catalyzed by RNase P. Furthermore, the m.5655A → G mutation changes the highly conserved base pairing (A1-U72) at the aminoacyl acceptor stem to G1-U72. It was hypothesized that the destabilization of base pairing (1A-72U) and change of the processing site for the tRNA 5′ end precursor by the m.5655A → G mutation altered the structure and function of tRNAAla. In particular, the mutation may affect the aminoacylation capacity and stability of this tRNA. A failure in tRNA metabolism leads to the impairment of mitochondrial translation and respiration. It was also proposed that mitochondrial dysfunctions caused by the tRNA mutation alter the production of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS). To investigate the pathogenic mechanism of the m.5655A → G mutation in these Chinese families, cybrid cell lines were constructed by transferring mitochondria from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from an affected matrilineal relative carrying the m.5655A → G mutation and from a control individual lacking the mtDNA mutation into human mtDNA-less [rho0] cells. These cybrid cell lines were first examined for the presence and degree of the mtDNA mutation. These cell lines were then assessed for the effects of the mtDNA mutation on tRNA metabolism, including aminoacylation efficiency and steady-state levels, mitochondrial translation, respiration, and production of ATP and ROS. RESULTS Identification of the tRNAAla 5655A → G mutation. The m.5655A → G mutation in the tRNAAla gene was found in three genetically unrelated probands in a cohort of 2,070 Chinese hypertensive subjects but was absent in 800 Chinese control subjects. As shown in Fig. 1, the m.5655A → G mutation was located at the 5′ end of tRNA, which is the processing site for the tRNAAla 5′ end precursors of the light strand, catalyzed by RNase P, and altered the A-U base pairing (A1-U72) at the aminoacyl acceptor stem of tRNAAla. The sequence analysis of the entire mtDNA in these probands exhibited the identical m.5655A → G mutations and distinct sets of polymorphisms belonging to the Eastern Asian haplogroups B4 and D4 (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). However, there were no other functional significant variants in their mitochondrial genomes. Clinical and genetic evaluation of three Chinese families. Members of three Chinese families carrying the m.5655A → G mutation underwent a physical examination, laboratory assessment of cardiovascular disease risk factors, and routine electrocardiography. In the pedigree WHP20, 12 of 19 matrilineal relatives had a wide range in levels of severity of hypertension (with blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg even with treatment for hypertension), while only 4 of 28 nonmaternal relatives suffered from hypertension. None of the offspring of five affected fathers exhibited hypertension, while one affected subject, IV-2, was the son of subject III-1, who married an affected wife (III-2). As shown in Table S2 in the supplemental material, the age at onset of hypertension in the maternal kindred varied from 38 years to 80 years, with an average of 56.7 years. Furthermore, 3 of 9 matrilineal relatives in the pedigree WHP21 suffered from hypertension, while 9 of 17 matrilineal relatives in the pedigree WHP22 exhibited hypertension. None of the other members in these families had hypertension. The average ages at onset of hypertension in these families were 50.3 and 56.4 years, respectively. There was no evidence that any member of these families had any other cause to account for hypertension. However, no other clinical abnormalities were observed in the maternal kindred. Further analysis showed that the m.5655A → G mutation was present in homoplasmy in all matrilineal relatives but not in other members of these families (data not shown). Generation of cybrid cell lines. The lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from one affected subject (WHP20-II-13) carrying the m.5655A → G mutation and one control individual (C1) lacking this mtDNA mutation but belonging to the same mtDNA haplogroup were enucleated and subsequently fused to a large excess of mtDNA-less human ρo206 cells, derived from the 143B.TK− cell line. The cybrid clones were isolated by growing the fusion mixtures in selective DMEM containing BrdU and lacking uridine. Between 25 and 45 days after fusion, 10 to 15 presumptive mitochondrial cybrids derived from each donor cell line were isolated and subsequently analyzed for the presence and level of the m.5655A → G mutation and copy number of mtDNA, respectively. The results confirmed the absence of the mtDNA mutation in the control clones and its presence in homoplasmy in all cybrids derived from the mutant cell line (data not shown). Furthermore, the karyotypes for each cybrid line were examined. Three cybrids derived from each donor cell line with similar mtDNA copy numbers and the same karyotype as 143B cell lines were used for the biochemical characterization described below. Impairment in the 5′ end processing of the mitochondrial tRNAAla precursor. We employed an in vitro processing system to determine if the primary defect arising from the m.5655A → G mutation is the perturbed processing of the tRNA's 5′ end by RNase P. The wild-type and mutant tRNAAla precursors corresponding to mtDNA at positions 5692 to 5567 (Fig. 2A) were prepared by in vitro transcription. The in vitro processing kinetics of the wild-type and mutant substrates were determined as detailed elsewhere. No qualitative processing alteration of the mutant tRNAAla precursor was observed, but the processing efficiency of the mutant tRNAAla transcript was reduced compared with that of the wild-type tRNAAla transcript (Fig. 2B). In particular, the processing efficiency of the mutant tRNAAla transcript was ∼65% of that of the wild-type tRNAAla transcript (Fig. 2C). Marked decrease in the steady-state level of mitochondrial tRNAAla. To examine whether the m.5655A → G mutation alters the tRNA metabolism, total mitochondrial RNA from cybrid cell lines was subjected to Northern blotting and hybridized with DIG-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide probes specific for tRNAAla and other tRNAs. The other probes were specific for tRNALys and tRNAHis as representatives of the whole heavy (H)-strand transcription unit and for tRNAGlu derived from the light (L)-strand transcription unit. The amounts of tRNAAla in mutant cells were markedly decreased compared to those in control cells (Fig. 3A). For comparison, the average level of each tRNA in the control or mutant cell line was normalized to the average level in the same cell line for the reference 5S RNA. The average steady-state level of tRNAAla in the three mutant cell lines was 56.5% (P = 0.01) of the level of the three control cell lines after normalization to 5S RNA. However, the average steady-state levels of tRNALys, tRNAHis, and tRNAGlu in the three mutant cell lines were 104.6%, 103.2%, and 91.9% of those in the three control cell lines, respectively (Fig. 3B). Altered aminoacylation of tRNAAla. The aminoacylation capacities of tRNAAla, tRNAThr, tRNASer(AGY), and tRNAGly in control and mutant cell lines were examined by the use of electrophoresis in an acid polyacrylamide-urea gel system to separate uncharged tRNA species from the corresponding charged tRNA, electroblotting, and hybridizing with the above tRNA probes. As shown in Fig. 4A, there were two bands for charged (upper band) and uncharged (lower band) species of wild-type tRNAAla, while only one band occurred in the mutated tRNAAla, which migrated more slowly than that of the wild-type tRNAAla. To further distinguish nonaminoacylated tRNA from aminoacylated tRNA, samples of tRNAs were deacylated by being heated for 10 min at 60°C at pH 8.3 and then run in parallel. As shown in Fig. 4B, only one band (uncharged tRNA) was present in both the mutant and control cell lines after deacylation. These data indicated that the m.5655A → G mutation caused the aberrant metabolism of aminoacylated tRNAAla. However, there were no obvious differences in electrophoretic mobility and aminoacylated efficiencies of other tRNAs between the mutant cell lines carrying the m.5655A → G mutation and the control cell lines lacking this mutation. Reduction in the level of mitochondrial proteins. Western blot analysis was carried out to examine the steady-state levels of six respiratory complex subunits (encoded by mtDNA) in mutant and control cells with TOM20 (mitochondrial protein encoded by the nuclear gene) as a loading control. The overall levels of six mitochondrial translation products in the mutant cell lines ranged from 21% to 37.5%, with an average of 29.1% (P = 0.02), relative to the mean value in the control cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1, mutant cell lines carrying the m.5655A → G mutation exhibited marked reductions (44% to 53%) in the levels of two polypeptides (ND1 and ATP6) harboring 8.4% to 8.5% alanine codons and relatively mild reductions (3% to 30%) in the levels of CO2, ND4, ND6, and CYTB carrying 4.6% to 6.6% alanine codons. However, the polypeptide levels in mutant cell lines, relative to those in control cell lines, did not significantly correlate with either the proportion or content of alanine codons, in contrast with what was previously shown in cells carrying the m.7445T → C mutation in the precursor of tRNASer(UCN) gene or m.8344A → G mutation in the tRNALys gene. Respiration defects in mutant cells. To evaluate if the m.5655A → G mutation alters cellular bioenergetics, we examined the oxygen consumption rates (OCR) of mutant and control cell lines. The basal OCR in the mutant cell lines was 64% (P = 0.005) relative to the mean value measured in the control cell lines (Fig. 6). The average values of ATP-linked OCR, proton leak OCR, maximal OCR, reserve capacity, and nonmitochondrial OCR in mutant cell lines were ∼65%, 58%, 54%, 32%, and 45%, respectively, relative to the mean values measured in the control cell lines (P = 0.039, 0.107, 0.029, 0.125, and 0.038, respectively) (Fig. 6). The activities of respiratory complexes were also measured by isolating mitochondria from three mutant and three control cell lines. Complex I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase) activity was determined by following the oxidation of NADH with ubiquinone as the electron acceptor. Complex III (ubiquinone cytochrome c oxidoreductase) activity was measured as a reduction of cytochrome c (III) using d-ubiquinol 2 as the electron donor. Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activity was monitored by following the oxidation of cytochrome c (II). As shown in Fig. 7, the activities of complexes I, II, III, and IV in the three mutant cell lines were 64%, 101%, 94%, and 82%, respectively, relative to the mean values measured in the control cell lines (P < 0.001, 0.847, 0.702, and 0.036, respectively). Reduced levels in mitochondrial ATP production. The capacity of oxidative phosphorylation in mutant and wild-type cells was examined by measuring the levels of cellular and mitochondrial ATP using a luciferin/luciferase assay. Populations of cells were incubated in the medium in the presence of glucose and 2-deoxy-d-glucose with pyruvate. As shown in Fig. 8A, the levels of ATP production in mutant cells in the presence of glucose (total cellular levels of ATP) ranged from 77% to 86%, with an average of 82% relative to the mean value measured in the control cell lines (P < 0.001). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 8B, the levels of ATP production in mutant cell lines, in the presence of pyruvate and 2-deoxy-d-glucose to inhibit the glycolysis (mitochondrial levels of ATP), ranged from 64% to 77%, with an average of 70% relative to the mean value measured in the control cell lines (P = 0.002). Decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) is the central bioenergetic parameter that controls respiratory rate, ATP synthesis, and the generation of ROS and is itself controlled by electron transport and proton leaks. The levels of ΔΨm were measured in three mutant and three control cell lines using a JC-10 fluorescent probe assay system. The ratios of fluorescence intensity at excitation/emission (Ex/Em) wavelengths of 490/590 and 490/530 nm (FL590/FL530) were recorded to determine the ΔΨm level of each sample. The relative ratios of the FL590/FL530 geometric mean between mutant and control cell lines were calculated to represent the level of ΔΨm. As shown in Fig. 9, the levels of the ΔΨm in the mutant cell lines carrying the m.5655A → G mutation ranged from 72.6 to 77.4%, with an average of 75.4% (P < 0.001) of the mean value measured in the control cell lines. In contrast, the levels of ΔΨm in mutant cells in the presence of FCCP [carbonyl cyanide-p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone] were comparable to those measured in the control cell lines (data not shown). The increase of mitochondrial ROS production. The total cellular levels of ROS generation in the vital cells derived from three mutant cell lines carrying the m.5655A → G mutation and three control cell lines lacking the mutation were measured with flow cytometry under normal conditions and under H2O2 stimulation. Geometric mean intensity was recorded to measure the rate of ROS of each sample. The ratio of geometric mean intensity between unstimulated and H2O2-stimulated cells was calculated to delineate the reaction upon increasing levels of ROS under oxidative stress. As shown in Fig. 10A, the total cellular levels of ROS generation in the mutant cell lines carrying the m.5655A → G mutation varied from 103% to 115%, with an average of 110% (P = 0.001) of the mean value measured in the control cell lines. Furthermore, the levels of mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS) among the cybrids were determined using a MitoSOX assay via flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 10B, the levels of mitochondrial ROS generation in the mutant cell lines carrying the m.5655A → G mutation ranged from 157% to 201%, with an average of 180% (P = 0.001) of the mean value measured in the control cell lines.",2606
29178484,"Introduction Very little is known about the way most metalloproteins obtain their metal cofactors. Although some metallochaperones exist, in many cases the metal must be not only incorporated into the protein during de novo folding but also needs to be selected from any of the other metals in the immediate environmental vicinity; the process of metalation.1 Mononuclear superoxide dismutases utilise either iron or manganese in their active sites and metalation of these enzymes can be made dependent upon the availability of the metal through provision of the metal in the culture growth medium when they are overexpressed in E.coli.2 The manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and iron superoxide dismutase (FeSOD) of E.coli are extremely similar in sequence (45 % conservative amino acids) and structure (91 % homology and RMSDCα‐monomer 1.6 Å) and yet to become an active enzyme, each enzyme must bind its cognate metal.3 Each enzyme may fold correctly while incorporating the “wrong” metal but the enzyme does not catalyse the conversion of superoxide to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, the normal function of SOD.4 Several attempts have been made using site‐directed mutagenesis to change ion specificity with the aim to interconvert SOD ion dependence, but with very little success.3c, 5 Interestingly, there are SODs that do indeed function with either metal and site‐directed mutagenesis has succeeded in adjusting the metal specificity of these, but they remain cambialistic nonetheless.6 One focus of such experiments has been the highly conserved glutamine residue in the active site that forms an intrinsic part of the hydrogen‐bonded network of amino acids and water necessary for full enzyme activity. The main reason for this is that in FeSOD the glutamine is provided by the N‐domain of the protein while in MnSOD the glutamine is contributed by the C‐domain. In either case the Nϵ2 and Oϵ1 atoms occupy almost identical positions in three‐dimensional space.5b, 7 This arrangement does not affect the three histidine residues and the aspartate that also coordinate directly to the metal cofactor, nor does it interfere with the one water (or hydroxyl ion, designated WAT1) directly bound to the metal; a common feature of all SODs. Furthermore, the glutamine, while bonding with the metal‐attached water, continues a hydrogen‐bonding network by binding to a similarly conserved tyrosine at position 34 in the sequence. Various analyses have been performed to identify the amino acid sequences that might form a signature for the discrimination between iron and manganese SODs with some initial success. Today, over three hundred SOD amino acids sequences are known and the boundary has become blurred and more difficult to identify. However, the signature first described by Parker and Blake (1988) to determine an MnSOD is reasonably accurate.8 One notable exception is the arrangement of amino acids found in the FeSOD of M.tuberculosis, in which the normally conserved N‐domain glutamine is replaced by a histidine residue provided by the C‐domain.9 We have therefore tested this intriguing exception by replacing glutamine in a C.elegans MnSOD (MnSOD‐3) with a histidine, generating the site‐directed mutant MnSOD‐3[Q142H]. We show that this single amino acid substitution is sufficient to convert the MnSOD into a cambialistic SOD, which we propose to be an essential element that determines ion specificity while maintaining SOD function. Results and Discussion Protein purification and characterization Wild‐type MnSOD‐3 and site‐directed mutant MnSOD‐3[Q142H] were cultured in minimal media containing either iron or manganese from the start of cell growth, and purified to homogeneity as described previously.10 Metal content was analysed by microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (MP‐AES) and showed that the purified proteins contained the canonical metal (Table 1). It is impossible to keep iron completely out of the growth medium and the Q142H mutant exhibited a higher selectivity for it than did wild type MnSOD‐3 when cultured in manganese‐supplemented media (Table 1).  Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the purified proteins indicated no secondary structural changes between mutants and wild type or between iron‐ or manganese‐containing SODs (results not shown). The structural integrity of the SODs was further probed through thermal denaturation experiments to determine their melting temperatures (T m) (Table 1). Although the melting temperatures of the mutant proteins were similar whether they incorporated iron or manganese, we found that iron‐containing wild‐type MnSOD‐3 appeared to be more stable than its manganese counterpart. If this were due to the effect of iron–amino acid bonding in the active site, we would still have expected the same trend to be seen in the Q142H mutant, but we did not. Enzyme activity The activity of the SODs was measured by the cytochrome c method and gave 3600±90 U mg−1 of protein for wild‐type MnSOD‐3, similar to previously measured values.10 MnSOD‐3 purified from cultures supplemented with iron and which was shown to contain mostly iron in the active site (Figure 1) yielded a value of only 16 U mg−1 of protein. If any activity in the iron‐substituted MnSOD was due to the manganese present (0.13 g atom per monomer) we would expect an activity of nearly 500. It may be assumed therefore that any residual manganese might be randomly distributed throughout the four subunits of each tetramer. It has previously been assumed that the minimal unit to provide enzyme activity is a fully metalated dimer within a tetramer (see Figure 1). This explains the very low, almost undetectable activity of the iron‐substituted MnSOD‐3, despite some manganese being present. Enzyme activity of the MnSOD‐3[Q142H] mutant was found to be 900±30 U mg−1 of protein when isolated from manganese‐supplemented media and 1179±19 U mg−1 of protein when iron‐substituted. Considering the metalation of each protein (Table 1) these values indicate that the Q142H mutation has converted MnSOD‐3 into a cambialistic enzyme that is active with either manganese or iron in the active site.  Structural analysis We have previously reported the structure of the wild‐type MnSOD‐3 from C.elegans (PDB: 3DC5 and 4X9Q) and its complex with the substrate analogue, azide (PDB: 5AG2).10, 11 These data have reinforced our understanding and the importance of the extensive hydrogen bonded network formed between the external solvent, a number of significant residues and the metal in the active site of the enzyme. Here we report the structure of the cambialistic mutant MnSOD‐3[Q142H] (PDB: 6ELK). Overall the MnSOD‐3[Q142H] structure was highly similar (RMSDCα‐all‐chains 0.19 and 0.15 Å) to the wild type MnSOD‐3 3DC5 and 4X9Q structures, respectively. As previously reported, there is evidence from the electron density maps of some flexibility in the region of chain A Q40‐A59 with the structure occupying two alternate conformations.11 The predominant density observed was similar to the configuration of 4X9Q. Therefore this conformation was used rather than that seen in 3DC5. Although we can see minor repositioning of some active site residues in the MnSOD‐3[Q142H] structure, the most significant finding is the alteration of the hydrogen‐bonded network (Figure 1). In MnSOD‐3 this is usually formed between H30 and Y34 via two solvent molecules, continues to Q142 and then to WAT1, the solvent ligand bound directly to the metal. The most obvious difference seen in the active site of the Q142H mutant is the movement of Y34. This residue is repositioned by 1.7 Å through an angular movement of 17.2° in comparison with the wild type Y34. The Y34 OH is in the position that is 1.5 Å closer to the H30 ND1. Consequently the requirement of two solvent molecules to form the hydrogen bonding between these atoms is reduced to just one (Figure 1 B). This hydrogen‐bonding arrangement is more like that found in other mononuclear SODs. However, this displacement now places the Y34 OH significantly farther away from the mutated H142, rendering hydrogen bonding impossible. The distance between Y34 OH to H142 NE2 is 4 Å whereas Y34 OH to Q142 NE2 in wild‐type is 2.9 Å, making the two atoms readily available to hydrogen bond. This occurs even though the Q142 NE2 of wild type and the H142 NE2 of the mutant are only 0.5 Å apart in the aligned structures (Figure 1 C). H142 NE2 can form the hydrogen bond with WAT1 being 2.9 Å away, thus connecting H142 with the metal ion centre. Although W122 is twisted slightly (12.2°) away from H142, no other effects of the mutation can be seen. Inter‐subunit distances between metal centres are virtually identical in the two structures (wild‐type and MnSOD‐3[Q142H]) indicating that there is virtually no change in dimeric or tetrameric contacts between subunits. We can infer from the requirement of protons to form hydrogen peroxide from superoxide substrates that the network of hydrogen bonds connecting solvent to metal must be essential for enzyme function. Y34 may be considered to be one possible source of protonation, but in the mutant Q142 H, communication between the metal centre and Y34 is lost as the hydrogen bonding network cannot connect via H42 and Y34. We therefore investigated this network using molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular dynamics simulations In MnSOD‐3[Q142H], the trajectory of a 100 ns simulation revealed an average of three waters in addition to the ubiquitous WAT1; the water or hydroxyl that is coordinated to the manganese cofactor. We observed an extra water between the manganese, Y34 and H30, with respect to the native MnSOD‐3. This additional water is also capable of hydrogen bonding to Y34 and H30. These residues, termed gateway residues, are of significance due to their proximity to the active site funnel through which it is presumed the superoxide substrate passes to reach the active centre. During simulations, this solvent occasionally approaches the manganese to a closest distance of 2.26 Å, making coordination between this water and the cofactor possible. This suggests that a sixth co‐ordination centre may form transiently as suggested for a yeast MnSOD mutant.12 In contrast to the X‐ray determined structure, during the 100 ns simulation the ring of H142 is observed to rotate by up to 180° placing H142 NE2 and H142 ND1 too far to allow for a hydrogen bond with the metal‐bound WAT1 (Figure 2 and Supporting Information). However, it was noted that throughout the trajectory, there were instances when a second water approaches which can form the hydrogen‐bonding network required to link H142 ND1 to the manganese via WAT1. There is, therefore, the potential to form two transient hydrogen bonding networks to the metal centre (via H142 and the gateway residues). The molecular dynamics simulations suggest that solvent movement near and around the active site facilitates the transfer of protons via the hydrogen bonding networks that may form and collapse over time.  Electrostatics analysis The electrostatic potential was calculated by solving linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation for solvent ionic strength I=0.15 M. Atomic charges of the metal cofactor were derived with the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) procedure from the electrostatic potential calculated at the B3LYP/def2‐SVP level. The active site surface is mainly positive in character, which is due to the positive formal (+1) charge of the metal cofactor. The surplus charge is not limited to the metal ion as it smears into the ligands coordinated to the metal. Figure 3 shows the results of these calculations for the cambialistic mutant MnSOD‐3[Q142H]. We have observed and analysed similar electrostatics for the wild‐type and iron‐containing MnSOD‐3 and for the manganese‐ and iron‐substituted mutant. We have looked at the overall electrostatic potentials generated at the protein surface as well as within the active site (Figure 3 and Supporting Information) and have found little difference between the proteins.

26735972,"Introduction Mutations in the nuclear gene POLG, which encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase γ (Pol γ), the sole enzyme responsible for DNA replication and repair in mitochondria, result in a highly heterogeneous group of mitochondrial disorders. The phenotypic spectrum of POLG-related mitochondrial disease includes progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), sensory and cerebellar ataxia, encephalopathy, neuropathy, focal and generalised epilepsy, dysarthria, distal myopathy, Parkinsonism, liver disease and premature ovarian failure. Although several distinct phenotypes have been reported in association with POLG mutations including childhood-onset Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, autosomal recessive and dominant of forms of PEO, myoclonic epilepsy, myopathy and sensory ataxia (MEMSA) and the ataxia-neuropathy spectrum (ANS) disorders, current thinking suggests that these previously defined syndromes are not discrete clinical entities but rather overlap considerably and lie on a continuum. One of the major challenges ahead is to delineate the full spectrum of POLG-related disease. The c.1399G>A mutation in exon 7 of POLG produces an alanine to threonine substitution (A467T) at a highly conserved site and is the most frequent pathogenic mutation in POLG-related mitochondrial disease. Exon 7 encodes the spacer domain of the polymerase, the function of which is largely unknown; although mutagenesis of this conserved region in the fruit fly protein has been shown to alter the activity, processivity and DNA-binding affinity of the enzyme. A467T exhibits common European ancestry with a carrier frequency of approx. 0.2% to 0.3% in mixed populations of European origin (http://exac.broadinstitute.org; http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS) although the carrier frequency has been reported to be as high as 1.3% to 1.4% in Belgian and British populations respectively. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the predicted homozygote rate would be 1 in 500,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 for a carrier frequency of 0.2% to 0.3%. The A467T mutation is functionally recessive and is usually found in trans with another POLG mutation, although homozygous A467T mutations do occur (Human DNA Polymerase Gamma Mutation Database, http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/polg/). In vitro studies have revealed that the A467T mutant enzyme exhibits a profound reduction in polymerase activity and processivity as a result of impaired interaction with the accessory subunit of the enzyme encoded by POLG2. The reasons underlying the variability in clinical spectrum and phenotypic severity associated with the homozygous A467T substitution remain unclear. We studied four unrelated patients with homozygous A467T POLG mutations and assessed them longitudinally to characterise the clinical spectrum of A467T-related disease. We undertook molecular genetic studies including MitoChip resequencing analysis, to consider the role of genetic modifiers on phenotype, and performed detailed pathological analysis of muscle, brain and liver samples. We present the results of our investigations and consider the mechanisms by which homozygous A467T mutations give rise to such diverse phenotypes. Results Pathology Patient 1 The liver showed patchy, predominantly perivenular areas of enlarged finely vacuolated hepatocytes and some congestion. On Oil red O staining, there was marked diffuse increase in lipid deposition in a microsteatotic pattern (Fig 1a and 1b). The fixed weight of the post-mortem brain was 1130 g. The external examination was unremarkable. On coronal slicing, there were no significant abnormalities. In particular there was no macroscopic evidence of focal cortical lesions. On histology (Fig 1c–1f), there were focal areas of cortical damage, most prominent in the occipital lobes but also extending in to the parietal lobes. The most severe foci (the occipital lobe) were characterized by neuronal loss, vacuolation of the neuropil (imparting a reticulated appearance) and astrocytosis (confirmed on GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) staining). The more mildly affected areas (the parietal lobes) showed superficial astrocytosis, affecting layers I and II of the cerebral cortex. The white matter was well preserved with only a few foci of pallor on luxol fast blue (LFB) staining. The thalamus showed some patchy vacuolation, neuronal loss, acute neuronal ischaemia and gliosis. The nuclei of the basal ganglia were unremarkable. Both hippocampi showed segmental neuronal loss of neurons in CA1 with less severe loss in CA3 and CA4. CA2 and the dentate gyrus were well preserved. Unequivocal granule cell dispersion was not seen. GFAP immunohistochemistry showed dense gliosis particularly in CA1 and to a lesser extent CA4. The cerebellum was well preserved with a few short gaps in the Purkinje cell layer. There was a prominent Bergman gliosis on GFAP staining. The brainstem was unremarkable. Patient 2 A brain biopsy taken at age 6 year showed cerebral cortex and a small amount of superficial white matter. The cortex was well populated with neurons, which showed no specific pathological abnormalities. There was some fine vacuolation of the neuropil but there were no diagnostic features. There was a diffuse cortical astrocytosis revealed by GFAP staining (Fig 2a and 2b). A muscle biopsy taken at age 15 years showed a normal variation in fibre size with no excess internal nuclei and no destructive features (no necrosis or regeneration). There was no evidence of significant endomysial fibrosis. There were no ragged red fibres. There was a little prominent lipid deposition on Oil red O. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR) histochemistry showed preserved myofibre architecture. There were no ragged blue fibres on succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) histochemistry. There were scattered COX-negative fibres. Fibre typing was within normal limits for the site (Fig 2c–2f). Patient 3 A deltoid muscle biopsy taken at the age of 43 years revealed mild variation in fibre size with occasional angular atrophic fibres and several fibres with internal nuclei but no increase in nuclear bag fibres or endomysial connective tissue. There was no evidence of regeneration, necrosis or inflammation. Glycogen and lipid content was normal and fibre typing showed a normal fibre distribution. There were frequent ragged red fibres and ragged red fibre equivalents on haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Gomori trichrome and SDH histochemical preparations. More than 10 COX-deficient fibres were identified in the biopsy (Fig 3a–3d). Patient 4 A deltoid muscle biopsy taken at the age of 30 years revealed mild variation in fibre size with no significant endomysial or perimysial fibrosis, no regeneration or degeneration, no vacuoles and no inflammation. Although ragged red fibres were scarce on Gomori trichrome, frequent ragged blue fibres were seen on SDH histochemistry and COX-deficient fibres were numerous (Fig 4a and 4b). Biochemistry Results of respiratory chain enzyme measurements in skeletal muscle are presented in Table 1. Molecular genetics Long-range PCR of mtDNA from patients 2, 3 and 4 revealed multiple deletions of mtDNA (Fig 5a), whilst only a full-sized wild-type mtDNA molecule was detected in patient 1. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that patient 1 had depletion of mtDNA in liver (25% residual mtDNA; Fig 5b), muscle (33% residual mtDNA; not shown) and heart (55% residual mtDNA; not shown) but normal levels of mtDNA in the kidney (not shown). Sequencing of the POLG gene identified a homozygous G to A change at nucleotide position (np) 1399 in exon 7 (c.1399G>A; p.A467T) in all four individuals. Mitochip re-sequencing analysis of the entire mtDNA molecule revealed a large number of variants in each of the four patients (identified variants are summarised in Table 2) with considerable variation between individuals. Patient 4 had an A to G point mutation at np 13528 in the complex 1 MTND5 gene which has been previously reported to be pathogenic in this patient. In addition, Patient 4 harboured an A>G change at np 12307, which has never previously been reported and a C>T change at np 13565. The first is in the MTTL2 gene encoding the transfer RNA for leucine (CUN), whilst the second results in a serine to phenylalanine substitution in the ND5 subunit of complex I. Patient 1 harboured a G>A transition at np 14279 which results in a serine to leucine substitution in the ND6 subunit of complex I. This has previously only been reported in 1/2704 individuals (http://www.mtdb.igp.uu.se/). Haplotype data for each patient is presented in Table 2.",1289
27536005,"INTRODUCTION The defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis have been associated with both syndromic deafness (hearing loss with other medical problems such as diabetes) and nonsyndromic deafness (hearing loss is the only obvious medical problem). The mitochondrial translation machinery composed of 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs, encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and more than 150 proteins (ribosomal proteins, ribosomal assembly proteins, aminoacyl–tRNA synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, and several initiation, elongation and termination factors), encoded by nuclear genes. Mutations in the LARS2 and NARS2 encoding mitochondrial leucyl–tRNA synthetase and asparaginyl–tRNA synthetase have been associated with deafness, respectively. The mtDNA mutations have been shown to be the important causes of both syndromic and nonsydromic deafness. Of these, the m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations in the 12S rRNA gene have been associated with both aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic deafness in many families worldwide. The most prevalent mtDNA mutations associated with syndromic deafness are the MELAS-associated m.3243A > G mutation in the mt–tRNALeu(UUR) gene and MERRF-associated m.8344A > G mutation in the mt–tRNALys gene, while the nonsyndromic deafness-associated mtDNA mutations included the mt–tRNASer(UCN) 7445A > G, 7472insC, 7505T > C and 7511T > C, mt–tRNAHis 12201T > C, mt–tRNAGly 10003T > C and mt–tRNAIle 4295A > G mutations. These mt–tRNA mutations altered their structures and functions, including the processing of the mt–tRNA from the primary transcripts, stability of the folded secondary structure, the charging of the mt–tRNA, or the codon–anticodon interaction in the process of translation. The m.7445A > G mutation altered the processing of the 3′ end mt–tRNASer(UCN) precursor, the m.7511T > C mutations affected the stability of mt-tRNASer(UCN) and m.12201T > C mutation altered the aminoacylation of mt–tRNAHis. However, the pathophysiology of these tRNA mutations remains poorly understood. As the part of a genetic screening program for deafness in a cohort of 2651 Han Chinese affected subjects, we identified the novel m.7551A > G mutation in the mt–tRNAAsp gene in one Han Chinese pedigrees with maternal transmission of nonsyndromic deafness. As shown in Figure 1, the m.7551A > G mutation is localized at a highly conserved nucleotide (A37), adjacent (3′) to the anticodon of mt–tRNAAsp. There were no modifications of i6A37 or t6A37 in the human mitochondrial tRNAAsp, although the nucleotides at position 37 (A or G) of tRNAs are often modified by methylthiolation. The modifications at position 37 were shown to contribute to the high fidelity of codon recognition and to the structural formation and stabilization of functional tRNAs. Thus, the substitution of A with G at position 37 of the mt–tRNAAsp may introduce the m1G37 modification of this tRNA, thereby altering the structure and function of mt–tRNAAsp. In particular, the mutation may affect the aminoacylation capacity and stability of this mt–tRNA and then impair mitochondrial translation. It was also proposed that an impairment of mitochondrial translation caused by the mt–tRNA mutation alters the respiration, production of adenosine triphoshate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). To further investigate the pathogenic mechanism of the m.7551A > G mutation, cybrid cell lines were constructed by transferring mitochondria from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from an affected matrilineal relative in a Chinese family carrying the mtDNA mutation and from a control individual lacking the mtDNA mutation, into human mtDNA-less (ρ°) cells. First, we examined if the m.7551A > G mutation created the m1G37 modification of mt–tRNAAsp by using primer extension. These resultant cybrid cell lines were then assessed for the effects of the mtDNA mutation on the aminoacylation capacity and stability of this mt–tRNA, mitochondrial translation, respiration and the production of ATP and ROS as well as mitochondrial membrane potential. RESULTS The description of one hearing-impaired Chinese pedigree and derived cell lines The pedigree of the Chinese family with maternally inherited deafness was previously described. Six of 12 matrilineal relatives suffered from the variable degree of hearing impairment (two with mild hearing loss, two with moderate hearing loss and two with profound hearing loss). The age-at-onset of hearing loss ranged from 5 to 45 years, with the average of 26 years. These matrilineal relatives exhibited no other clinical abnormalities, including cardiac failure, muscular diseases, visual failure and neurological disorders. Immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines were derived from one affected matrilineal relative carrying the m.7551A > G mutation, with profound hearing loss (III-6; male, 21 years) and from one genetically unrelated hearing normal individual lacking the m.7551A > G mutation belong to the same mtDNA haplogroup (A4, male, 20 years). The lymphoblastoid cells were enucleated, and subsequently fused to a large excess of mtDNA-less human ρ°206 cells, derived from the 143B.TK- cell line. These cybrid clones were isolated by growing the fusion mixtures in the selective Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, containing BrdU and lacking uridine. Between 25 and 45 days after fusion, 10–15 presumptive mitochondrial cybrids derived from each donor cell line were isolated, and subsequently analyzed for the presence and level of the m.7551A > G mutation. The results confirmed the absence of the mtDNA mutation in the control clones and its presence in homoplasmy in all cybrids derived from the mutant cell line (Supplementary Figure S1). Three cybrids derived from each donor cell line with similar mtDNA copy numbers were used for the biochemical characterization described below. The m.7551A > G mutation created the m1G37 modification of mt–tRNAAsp There were no modifications of i6A37 or t6A37 detected in the human mitochondrial tRNAAsp. To investigate if the m.7551A>G mutation produced the m1G37 modification of mt–tRNAAsp, we subjected mitochondrial RNAs from mutant and control cybrid cell lines to the reverse transcription with DIG-labeled oligonucleotide probe specific for mt–tRNAAsp (Figure 1A). This results in a stop band one residue 3′ to the methylation on 15% polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Figure 1B, the m1G37 modification was present in mt–tRNAAsp derived from three mutant cell lines, while the m1G37 modification was not detected in the mt-tRNAAsp derived from three control cell lines. Furthermore, the m1A9 modifications were detected in mt–tRNAAsp obtained from both control and mutant cell lines. Reduction in the steady-state level of mt–tRNAAsp To examine if the m.7551A > G mutation affects the stability of mt–tRNAAsp, we subjected mitochondrial RNAs from cybrids cell lines to Northern blots and hybridized them with DIG-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide probes for mt–tRNAAsp, mt–tRNAThr, mt–tRNALeu(CUN), mt–tRNALys and mt–tRNASer(AGY), respectively. As shown in Figure 2A, the amount of mt–tRNAAsp in three mutant cell lines were markedly decreased, compared with those in three control cybrid cell lines. For comparison, the average level of each mt–tRNAAsp in control or mutant cell lines was normalized to the average levels in the same cell line for reference mt–tRNAThr, mt–tRNALeu(CUN), mt–tRNALys and mt–tRNASer(AGY), respectively. As shown in Figure 2B, the average steady-state level of mt–tRNAAsp was significantly decreased in the mutant cells, compared with the wild-type cells. In particular, the average levels of mt–tRNAAsp in the mutant cybrid cell lines were among ∼58%, 52%, 64% and 57% of average values of three control cybrids after normalization to mt–tRNAThr, mt–tRNALeu(CUN), mt–tRNALys and mt–tRNASer(AGY) (P < 0.0018 to 0.0005), respectively. Deficient aminoacylation of mt–tRNAAsp We evaluated whether the m.7551A > G mutation alters the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNAs. For this purpose, the aminoacylation capacities of mt–tRNAAsp, mt–tRNAThr, mt–tRNALeu(CUN), mt–tRNALys and mt–tRNASer(AGY) in control and mutant cell lines were examined by the use of electrophoresis in an acidic polyacrylamide/urea gel system to separate uncharged tRNA species from the corresponding charged tRNA, electroblotting and hybridizing with the tRNA probes described above. As shown in Figure 3A, the upper band represents the charged tRNA, and the lower band represents uncharged tRNA. There were no obvious differences in electrophoretic mobility between the control and mutant cell lines. To further distinguish nonaminoacylated tRNA from aminoacylated tRNA, samples of tRNAs were deacylated by being heated for 10 min at 60°C at pH 8.3 and then run in parallel. As shown in Figure 3B, only one band (uncharged tRNA) was present in both mutant and control cell lines after deacylating. However, the efficiencies of aminoacylated mt–tRNAAsp in these mutant cell lines carrying the m.7551A > G mutation varied from 74 to 84%, with average of 80%, relative to the average values of control cell lines (P = 0.0072) (Figure 3C). However, the levels of aminoacylation in mt–tRNAThr, mt–tRNALeu(CUN), mt–tRNALys and mt–tRNASer(AGY) in the mutant cell lines were comparable with those in the control cell lines (Supplementary Figure S2). Decreases in the level of mitochondrial proteins To assess whether a failure in mt–tRNAAsp metabolism caused by the m.7551A > G mutation impaired mitochondrial translation, a Western blot analysis was carried out to examine the steady state levels of seven subunits of respiratory complex in mutant and control cells with GAPDH as a loading control. As shown in Figure 4A, the levels of p.MT-CO1 and p.MT-CO2, subunits I and II of cytochrome c oxidase; p.MT-ND1, p.MT-ND4 and p.MT-ND5, subunits 1, 4 and 5 of NADH dehydrogenase; p.MT-ATP6, subunit 6 of the H±ATPase; p.MT-CYTB, apocytochrome b exhibited the variable reductions in three mutant cell lines, as compared with those of three control cell lines. As shown in Figure 4B, the overall levels of seven mitochondrial translation products in the mutant cell lines ranged from ∼58–76%, with an average of 65% (P = 0.0106), relative to the mean value measured in the control cell lines. Notably, the average levels of p.MT-ND1, p.MT-ND4, p.MT-ND5, p.MT-ND6, p.MT-CO2, p.MT-ATP6 and p.MT-CYTB in the mutant cells were 39%, 64%, 76%, 39%, 70%, 45% and 58% of the average values of control cells, respectively. However, the levels of polypeptide synthesis in mutant cells, relative to those in control cells, showed no significant correlation with either the number of codons or the proportion of aspartic acid residues (Supplementary Table S2). Respiration defects in mutant cells To evaluate if the m.7551A > G mutation alters cellular bioenergetics, we examined the OCR of three mutant cell lines carrying the m.7551A > G mutation and three control cell lines. As shown in Figure 5, the basal OCR in the mutant cell lines was ∼59% (P = 0.047) relative to the mean value measured in the control cell lines. To investigate which of the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain was affected in the mutant cell lines, OCR was measured after the sequential addition of oligomycin (to inhibit the ATP synthase), carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (to uncouple the mitochondrial inner membrane and allow for maximum electron flux through the ETC), rotenone (to inhibit complex I) and antimycin A (to inhibit complex III). The difference between the basal OCR and the drug-insensitive OCR yields the amount of ATP-linked OCR, proton leak OCR, maximal OCR, reserve capacity and non-mitochondrial OCR. As shown in Figure 5, the ATP-linked OCR, proton leak OCR, maximal OCR, reserve capacity and non-mitochondrial OCR in mutant cell lines were ∼74%, 38%, 61%, 117% and 137%, relative to the mean value measured in the control cell lines (P = 0.065, 0.045, 0.011, 0.330 and 0.084), respectively. Reduced activities of respiratory chain complexes To investigate the effect of the m.7551A > G mutation on the oxidative phosphorylation, we measured the activities of respiratory chain complexes by isolating mitochondria from mutant and control cell lines. Complex I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase) activity was determined by following the oxidation of NADH with ubiquinone as the electron acceptor. Complex III (ubiquinone cytochrome c oxidoreductase) activity was measured as the reduction of cytochrome c (III) using d-ubiquinol-2 as the electron donor. The activity of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) was monitored by following the oxidation of cytochrome c (II). As shown in Figure 6, the activity of complexes I, II, III and IV in the mutant cells carrying m.7551A > G mutation were 49%, 104%, 71% and 69% of the mean value measured in three control cell lines, respectively. Reduced levels in mitochondrial ATP production The capacity of oxidative phosphorylation in mutant and wild-type cell lines was examined by measuring the levels of cellular and mitochondrial ATP using a luciferin/luciferase assay. Populations of cells were incubated in the media in the presence of glucose, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose with pyruvate. As shown in Figure 7A, the levels of ATP production in mutant cells in the presence of glucose (total cellular levels of ATP) were 80% of those measured in the control cell lines. By contrast, as shown in Figure 7B, the levels of ATP production in mutant cell lines, in the presence of pyruvate and 2-deoxy-D-glucose to inhibit glycolysis (mitochondrial levels of ATP) ranged from 54 to 63%, with an average of 57% relative to the mean value measured in the control cell lines (P = 0.0012). Mild decreases in mitochondrial membrane potentials The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) changes were measured in mutant and control cell lines using the fluorescence probe JC-10 assay system. The ratios of fluorescence intensities Ex/Em = 490/590 and 490/530 nm (FL590/FL530) were recorded to delineate the ΔΨm level of each sample. The relative ratios of FL590/FL530 geometric mean between mutant and control cell lines were calculated to represent the level of ΔΨm. As shown in Figure 8, the levels of the ΔΨm in the mutant cell lines carrying the m.7551A > G mutation ranged from 77.2% and 96.8%, with an average 86.2% (P = 0.182) of the mean value measured in the control cell lines. In contrast, the levels of ΔΨm in mutant cells in the presence of carbonyl cyanide-p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone were comparable with those measured in the control cell lines (P = 0.766). The increase of ROS production The levels of the ROS generation in the vital cells derived from three mutant cybrid cell lines carrying the m.7551A > G mutation and three control cybrid cell lines lacking the mutation were measured with flow cytometry under normal conditions and following H2O2 stimulation. Geometric mean intensity was recorded to measure the rate of ROS of each sample. The ratio of geometric mean intensity between unstimulated and stimulated with H2O2 in each cell line was calculated to delineate the reaction upon increasing level of ROS under oxidative stress. As shown in Figure 9, the levels of ROS generation in the mutant cell lines carrying the m.7551A > G mutation ranged from 126 and 140%, with an average 132% (P = 0.0035) of the mean value measured in the control cell lines.",2352
26014388,"Mitochondria play a central role in a variety of cellular processes, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), cell signaling, calcium buffering, and apoptosis. There are approximately 1000 proteins in the mitochondria, only 13 of which are encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Most mitochondrial diseases are caused by nuclear-encoded DNA mutations and follow Mendel’s laws of inheritance. However, many fatal pathological conditions such as Leigh syndrome, leukoencephalopathy, and some degenerative diseases such as cancer, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) are associated with mtDNA mutations. Mitochondrial respiratory complex I (NADH:quinone oxidoreductase), which is the first and largest enzyme in OXPHOS, is the major electron entry point to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. A long-term survey of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders in Australian children showed that OXPHOS disorders were frequently observed in newborns, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 5,000 and complex I defects accounted for approximately 25–35% of these cases. Complex I is composed of 38 nuclear subunits and seven mtDNA encoded subunits, which are assembled in the inner mitochondrial membrane to form an L-shaped structure. In mammalian cells, complex I consists of 14 core subunits for the assembly of the complex I scaffold motif and 31 additional supernumerary subunits of unknown function. In vertebrates, all seven mtDNA encoded hydrophobic subunits [mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1–6 and 4L (ND1-ND6 and ND4L)] are core subunits of complex I and form the major complex I membrane arm. Mutations in NADH dehydrogenase (ND) subunits can disrupt either complex I assembly or enzyme activity. Recent studies have shown that approximately 20% of cases of isolated complex I deficiency were caused by mtDNA mutations in mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase (MTND) genes. In particular, mutations in ND subunits were associated with LHON, MELAS, and Leigh Syndrome. New pathogenic MTND mutations are being frequently identified, but the functional consequences of these mutations have not been confirmed. Elucidation of the functional effects of pathogenic mtDNA mutations will aid in the genetic diagnosis of patients with complex I deficiency. However, the identification of new pathogenic mtDNA mutations is difficult due to the diversity of mtDNA polymorphisms and the clinical heterogeneity of disease. In this study, we screened the whole mitochondrial genome in a large cohort of 41 pediatric patients with biochemical manifestations of complex I deficiency. Patients with recurrent mutations such as m.3243A > G, m.8993T > G/C and m.8344A > G were ruled out of the study before the sequence screening. The reported pathogenic mtDNA mutations m.3697G > A and m.14487T > C were identified in two patients with MELAS and Leigh syndrome, respectively. Furthermore, we identified one patient with exercise intolerance and developmental delay harboring a novel pathogenic mutation m.12955A > G [p. Asn(N)207Asp(D)]. To further confirm the pathogenic mechanism of the m.12955A > G mutation, a series of cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines with different loads of the m.12955A > G mutation were constructed by transferring mitochondria from the patient into mtDNA-less ρ0 human osteosarcoma 143B cells. The effects of the m.12955A > G mutation on OXPHOS deficiency was analyzed by assessing mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and lactate acid levels in addition to complex I assembly and activity. Results Clinical data Samples from 41 patients diagnosed with OXPHOS deficiency and their maternal family members were obtained from Peking University First Hospital (China). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects under protocols approved by the Ethical Committee of the Peking University First Hospital. All experimental methods were carried out in accordance with approved guidelines of Peking University First Hospital. The patient (female, aged 9 years at the time of this study) identified with the novel mtDNA 12955A > G mutation, was born in a non-consanguineous Chinese family and presented with clinical manifestations of exercise intolerance and developmental delay. The child was initially investigated for muscle weakness, malnutrition and developmental and psychomotor retardation at the age of 6 months. She was referred to our hospital at the age of 2 years and 3 months owing to her inability to walk. The patient showed progressive deterioration in terms of muscle pain, severe fatigue, and dizziness, which were exacerbated by a short period of exercise. Physical examination indicated that the patient had limb hypotonia, muscle relaxation, knee tendon reflex hyperfunction with normal ankle clonus and Babinski sign, as well as reduced growth [weight: 22 kg (normal 24.1–35.3 kg)]; height: 123 cm (normal 125.7–138.7 cm). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no pathological alterations. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood lactate levels were 1.3 mmol/L (normal range, 1.0–2.8 mmol/L) and 3.9 mmol/L (normal range, 0.5–2 mmol/L), respectively. The lactate/pyruvate ratio in the CSF was 15 but reached 58 in blood (normal range <20), suggesting a respiratory chain dysfunction in this patient. Following treatment with a combination of L-carnitine (1 g/day), calcium folinate (15 mg/day), arginine (1 g/day), vitamin B1 [30 mg twice daily (b.i.d.)], vitamin B2 (5 mg b.i.d.), vitamin C (100 mg/day), vitamin E (50 mg b.i.d.) and coenzyme Q10 (10 mg b.i.d.) at 2 years and 3 months of age, the patient’s symptoms improved significantly and she was able to walk unaided after 3 months of treatment. Biochemical analysis The enzyme activity of complex V (ATP synthase) and four mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRCs) were measured in the lymphoblasts of the patient, as previously described. The activity of each enzyme was normalized against that of citrate synthase, a mitochondrial matrix marker enzyme (Table 1). Based on the criteria of OXPHOS enzyme activity from 100 healthy children, defective complexes I and IV were identified in the patient (Table 1). Identification of pathogenic mutations To identify the pathogenic role of these MRCs deficiencies, the whole mitochondrial genome of the patient and her maternal relatives were subjected to Sanger sequencing. The patient was found to be carrying an unreported heteroplasmic mutation, m.12955A > G (p.N207D). The mutant load was quantified by subjecting the blood and urine samples from the patient and a blood sample from her mother to real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). As shown in Fig. 1A, the mutant load was higher in the blood of the patient compared with that in the blood of her mother (50.1% vs. 32%, respectively). In the urinary epithelium of the patient, the mutant load of m.12955A > G was even higher (63.2%). Since blood and urinary epithelium always contain lower mutant loads than do other tissues, we believed that a higher mutant load of m.12955A > G would be found in other tissues such as brain and muscle from the patient. Unfortunately, we were unable to analyze the mutant loads in muscle and fibroblasts from the patient. In addition, the patient’s parents declined further investigations since our diagnosis of mild clinical manifestation was similar to a previous report by Downham et al.. In addition, no complex IV-related mtDNA mutations were detected, although a decline of complex IV activity was identified in this patient (Table 2). Since the stability and activity of some MRCs are interdependent, it is possible that the complex I deficiency caused by m.12955A > G may decrease the assembly/stability of complex IV. Furthermore, the possibility of a rare polymorphism at 12955 was excluded by screening for the mutation in 161 control subjects. The features of m.12955A > G were further analyzed to evaluate its pathogenicity. A protein structure model of ND5 revealed that residue 207 is located in the third hydrophilic extramembrane loop (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P03915). An N to D substitution introduces a negative charge at residue 207 in the extramembrane loop, thereby changing the electrostatic forces, which are important for protein-protein interactions. Together, these findings indicated the pathogenic potential of the m.12955A > G mutation. Construction of cybrid cell lines containing different m.12955A>G mutant loads To understand the pathogenic role of m.12955A > G fully, we generated a series of cybrid cell lines containing different loads of the mutation. Briefly, platelets from the patient were fused with mtDNA-less ρ0 human osteosarcoma 143B cells, and 20 single cybrid clones were selected by culturing the fusion mixtures in medium without uridine and sodium pyruvate for 15 days. Clone #9, #17, and #18 cells with mutant loads of 65.21%, 21.76% and 98.14%, respectively, were selected by real-time PCR for further analysis. However, owing to the poor sensitivity of Sanger sequencing in detecting of heteroplasmic mutations at mutant loads below 20%, the mutation was not detected in the sequencing of clone #17 (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the cell morphology of the selected clones revealed that increased loads of the m.12955A > G mutation were associated with decreased cell viability (Fig. 1C). Cells with 20% of the m.12955A > G mutation had a smooth cell membrane and an elongated cell shape, which were comparable with that observed in wild type 143B cells, while cells with 65% of the heteroplasmic m.12955A > G mutation were smaller. Furthermore, cells with 98% of heteroplasmic m.12955A > G cells were aggregated and showed reduced viability (Fig. 1C). This result indicates that an m.12955A > G mutation affects cell viability in a mutant load-dependent manner. Due to the similar morphology between clone #17 cells and wild type 143B cells, and the observation that the m.12955A > G mutant load in the mother of the patient was approximately 30% but without the clinical phenotype, clone #17 cells were used as a control for clone #9 and #18 cells. Blue native PAGE analysis of respiratory complex assembly Intact complex I was analyzed by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) to evaluate whether the m.12955A > G mutation impairs the assembly of complex I. Mitochondria isolated from the cells of clone #9, #17, and #18 were separated by BN-PAGE to assay for in-gel complex I activity and immunoblotting analysis of complex I with an antibody against NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex 13 (NDUFA13). As shown in Fig. 2A, cells of clone #18 cells had less intact complex I but more subcomplex I just below the position of complex I, compared to that observed in the cells of clone #9 and #17. However, complex I assembly in clone #9 was not affected when compared with clone #17 cells, suggesting that complex I assembly was impaired only by high m.12955A > G mutant loads. Moreover, a considerable decrease in complex IV assembly was found in clone #18 cells compared with clone #17 cells, while assembly of complex IV was normal in clone #9 cells. This indicates that the decrease in complex I assembly in clone #9 cells is not sufficient to affect complex IV assembly. Additionally, the assembly of complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase), and complex V were not affected in either clone #9 or #18 cells, compared with clone #17 cells (Fig. 2A). In-gel activity assays confirmed that the nearly homoplasmic mutant cybrid cells of clone #18 cells exhibited a significantly reduced complex I and IV activity relative to that of clone #17 cells (Fig. 2B). Together, our results indicate that a high m.12955A > G mutant load can impair complex I assembly, which may further affect the stability of complex IV. Mitochondrial functional analysis The endogenous respiration of intact cells was first measured to clarify the role of increased m.12955A > G mutant loads on mitochondrial function. As shown in Fig. 3A, although no significant decrease in base respiration was detected in intact cells, clone #9 and #18 cells showed a trend towards decreased respiratory function. Furthermore, coupled and uncoupled mitochondrial respiration among clone #9, #17, and #18 cells was measured in the presence of oligomycin, which completely blocks the ATPase proton channel. Clone #17 cells exhibited higher coupled OXPHOS respiration and respiratory coupling efficiency compared with clone #9 and #18 cells (Fig. 3A and B). Since only clone #18 cells exhibited a significantly reduced complex I [NADH:nitrotetrazolium blue (NTB) oxidoreductase] activity relative to that of clone #17 cells in in-gel activity assay (Fig. 2B), complex I activity of clone #9 cells was further measured as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase using spectrophotometry-based complex I enzyme activity assay. As shown in supplementary Fig. 3, clone #9 cells exhibited a significantly reduced complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) activity compared with control #17 cells. These observations suggested that the m.12955A > G mutation in ND5 impaired mitochondrial function by decreasing both the total mitochondrial respiration and the respiratory coupling efficiency. To further confirm the effect of m.12955A > G on mitochondrial function, ATP synthesis was determined in boiled cells by luminometry. As shown in Figure 4A, although the total ATP content in cells that were 65% heteroplasmic (clone #9) were not significant different with those in cells that were 21% heteroplasmic (clone #17), clone #9 cells showed a trend towards decreased ATP generation. Furthermore, the ATP generation in cells that were 98% heteroplasmic (clone #18) was much lower, suggesting a positive correlation between mitochondrial dysfunction and m.12955A > G mutant load. After the addition of rotenone, the ATP generation by respiratory complex I decreased with an increasing m.12955A > G mutant load (Fig. 4A). Thus, our findings further confirm that m.12955A > G impairs mitochondrial function by affecting complex I. To test the toxicity of the m.12955A > G mutation, extracellular lactate acid and mitochondrial ROS levels were measured in all three cell lines. As shown in Fig. 4B, lactate acid generation increased with the mutant load of m.12955A > G. Furthermore, a significant increase in mitochondrial ROS was detected in clone #18 cells compared with that in clone #17 (Fig. 4C). After treatment with the complex I-related ROS-inducer rotenone for 1 h, both clone #9 and #17 cells showed a dramatic increase (approximately 1 fold for both) in ROS generation, while the increase in clone #18 cells was slight (approximately 20%). Interestingly, the ROS levels induced by rotenone in clone #9 and #17 cells were comparable with those in clone #18 cells with or without rotenone. This indicated that the high ROS levels in clone #18 cells were caused by the impairment of complex I. To clearly understand the implications of m.12955A > G in mitochondrial dysfunction, the effect of the mutation in mitochondrial function was also determined by comparing clone #9, #17, and #18 with 143B wild type cells. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4A, we found that both clone #9 and #18 cells presented a significant decrease of complex I-related ATP generation relative to that in 143B wild type cells. Clone #17 cells showed a mild decrease of complex I related ATP generation when compared to 143B wild type cells. In Supplementary Fig. 4B, the toxicity test for the m.12955A > G mutation showed that clone #9, #17, and #18 cells exhibited higher mitochondrial ROS generation than did 143B wild type cells. After the addition of rotenone, the mitochondrial ROS levels were more or less the same in the four cell lines, suggesting that the m.12955A > G mutation increases mitochondrial ROS generation through the impairment of complex I. Taken together, our results confirm that the mutation of m.12955A > G in complex I causes disease.",2403

23509753,"1. Past As far back as 1850 scientists identified the existence of structures within cells that today we call mitochondria. However, it was not until 1898 that the these structures were given the term mitochondria by Carl Benda. Cytologists worked hard to identify the function of mitochondria and in 1912 the first reference to a possible link between mitochondria and respiration was made by Kingsbury. This link was made exclusively from morphological observations. What followed was 30–40 years of intense biochemical analyses before the characterization of mitochondria as the “Powerhouse of the Cell” by Siekevitz in 1957. Leading up to this there were a number of key events. In 1909 Correns and Baur independently identified the first cases of extracellular inheritance. The source and site of this was unknown at the time, though mitochondria were the prime suspect. Ephrussi's laboratory had been working with yeast and their key publication in 1949 used genetic analysis to show that respiration-deficient baker's yeast harboured mutations found in the cytoplasm, and not the nucleus. Soon thereafter Slonimski and Ephrussi investigated this area further and showed the deficiency was due to mitochondrial dysfunction.  On the back of these exciting findings, one of the most important discoveries in mitochondrial research was made in 1963, when the identification of the existence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was made by M. M. Nass and S. Nass. Using electron microscopy they showed conclusively that chick embryo mitochondria contained DNA. The importance of this discovery cannot be overstated; as it renewed interest in the evolutionary origin of mitochondria. These findings were confirmed biochemically in 1964 when Schatz and Klima showed that baker's yeast mitochondria also contained DNA. This of course led to more questions, specifically does the mtgenome interact with the nuclear genome, and if so how does this occur?   The mtDNA sequence was first published as being 16,569 base pairs long in 1981 by Anderson et al., the sequence was later revised by Andrews et al. in 1999. Following the publication of the mtDNA sequence there was a focus on mitochondrial genomics that has been sustained till today. This work initially focused on myopathies and neuropathies by Wallace et al.. These so called “mitochondrial diseases” were due to both mitochondrial and nuclear mutations, where a symbiotic relationship exists between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Understanding the complexity of these interactions is the key to detecting dysfunction within the cell.   Mitochondria control various metabolic functions and synthesizes 95% of cellular metabolic energy, while 1,200 nuclear genes drive and participate in mitochondrial function. There are 37 genes coded for by the mtgenome, 24 of which are dedicated to processing 13 genes within the mtgenome (mtgenome) itself which produce the subunits essential to electron transport. These 13 key genes work in conjunction with 93 nuclear proteins. In cancer cells certain mutations in the mtgenome can alter the biochemical behaviour of mitochondrial/nuclear protein complexes, thereby increasing pools of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn enable tumour growth and may provide proliferative advantage to the cell. Thus despite its small size relative to the nuclear genome, somatic mutations that occur in the mtgenome are able to contribute directly to the process of tumourigenesis.   There is now a significant body of literature describing the interactions between mitochondria and the nucleus. It appears that the somatic mutations which can alter these interactions occur early in the disease process, appearing in histologically normal tissues. This leaves us with a key question with regard to mitochondrial mutations, are they causative factors of disease or a simple record of the development of disease? In 1924 Otto Heinrich Warburg postulated that cancer and tumour growth are in part caused by a change in the way the cells generate their energy. In normal healthy cells, ATP is generated mainly by oxidative breakdown of pyruvate following non-oxidative breakdown of glucose during the process of glycolysis. In contrast, malignant cell metabolism stalls after glycolysis a phenomenon that Warburg reported as the fundamental difference between normal and cancerous cells. These observed differences in the ratio of glycolysis to respiration have become known as the Warburg effect. It has since become clear that these metabolic differences adapt cancer cells to the hypoxic conditions inside solid tumours. Thus it may be theorized that rather than causing cancer, perhaps these changes are characteristics produced by key cancer-causing mutations in certain genes involved in the aforementioned symbiotic relationship between nucleus and mitochondria. These findings have led to a new theory known as the Warburg theory of cancer, which suggests that the main driver of tumorigenesis is an insufficient cellular respiration caused by insult to mitochondria.   Clearly mitochondria are key to the function of both normal and malignant cells, and there has been much speculation about the origins of mitochondria, with perhaps the most prevalent theory being that of an endosymbiotic origin. Mitochondria have many features in common with prokaryotes, and this theory is generally accepted today. At its very basic level, the endosymbiotic theory hypothesises that mitochondria, chloroplasts and perhaps other organelles of eukaryotic cells, originated as independent organisms which were taken inside what became eukaryotic cells as endosymbionts. It has been suggested that mitochondria as we know them today developed from proteobacteria, specifically the SAR11 lineage. Although the endosymbiotic theory has been around for over one hundred years, it remains a controversial and developing hypothesis with new evidence for and against the theory still appearing today. Although beyond the scope of this publication, this controversy certainly highlights mitochondria as a hot topic for research in many diverse fields of study. 2. Present Mitochondria play a central role in the regulation of cellular function, metabolism, and cell death in cancer cells. Several important functional changes to cancer cell mitochondrial have been observed that implicate the organelle in tumour formation including increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and a corresponding increase in glycolysis. However, the specific role of mitochondria in tumourigenesis remains unclear as these changes could represent either key mechanisms in tumour initiation, promotion, or simply secondary effects of tumourigenesis. In 2011, deregulated cellular energetics was considered as an additional emerging hallmark of cancer. Cancer cell signaling that is regulated by kinases and phosphatases are guided by cellular redox status and may be a key in malignant transformation. This section briefly examines the role that mitochondria play in the cancer cell phenotype by relating the physiological process of the organelle to genomic and proteomic studies. 2.1. Role of Mitochondria in Oncogenesis Recent studies of mitochondrial involvement in cancer have uncovered a plethora of differences in the structure and function of these organelles upon comparing metastatic mitochondria to those belonging to nontransformed cells. Notably, modern research has largely upheld the metabolic observations of Warburg and his successors, while refining and greatly expanding the breadth of mechanistic knowledge of mitochondrial state and function in tumour development. The comprehensive mechanisms of the Warburg effect have not yet been isolated; however, multiple intertwining causative and responsive mechanisms have recently been characterized. This understanding of the indicative features of cancer cell metabolism has also directly been applied to current clinical care through the increasingly widespread adoption of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using glucose analogues to identify cancerous lesions that are characterized by high glucose uptake. Study of the mechanisms of the Warburg effect has revealed that the characteristic metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis and increased glucose uptake imparts several functional advantages to the cancer cell. These advantages permit rapid growth and survival in conditions that would be potentially lethal to noncancerous cells. Perhaps the most significant shift in the understanding of the Warburg effect in recent years has been the abandonment of the view that aerobic glycolysis is a metabolic defect of cancer cells, in favor of the theory that cancer cell metabolism is maintained through regulatory control, and better fits the metabolic profile of rapidly dividing cells. The most recognized of these adaptations is the utilization of abundant glycolytic pathway intermediates in multiple anabolic reactions critical to the survival and growth of rapidly dividing cells. The demand for glucose-derived carbon skeletons for macromolecule synthesis of molecules such as glycogen, phospholipids, triglycerides, and malate, exceeds the demand for efficient ATP production. Glucose is also alternatively metabolized in cancer cells through an enhanced pentose phosphate pathway that results in the synthesis of nucleotides and antioxidant nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The cancer cell's lack of reliance on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP generation also permits cellular survival in conditions of inconsistent oxygen supply, an environment that is typical for rapidly expanding tumours which can, at times, experience inadequate angiogenesis. Local acidification of the tumour microenvironment is also induced through the glycolytic generation of excess bicarbonic and lactic acids. The resultant pH change is recognized to favour tumour growth and invasion through the activation of cancer cell-derived cathepsins and metalloproteinases, and the inhibition of the subsequent host immune responses. Additionally, the ensuing excessive production of lactate can be converted to pyruvate in cancer-associated stromal cells to fuel oxidative phosphorylation within these cells.  It is also well established that the enhanced production of mitochondrial ROS, most notably superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide, is a prominent byproduct of cancer cell metabolism. Increased oxidative phosphorylation in pre-metastatic cells therefore increases the production of mitochondrial ROS, which may be an initiative factor in carcinogenesis. The mechanisms of ROS production and their significant downstream effects have become important topics in current mitochondrial research in cancer. Excess ROS act not only as mutagens and initiators of oxidative stress, but are also significant inter- and intracellular signaling molecules, responsible for a host of nuclear and mitochondrial changes in gene expression, the details of which are reviewed by Verschoor et al.. The well-established addiction to glutamine as an energy source of proliferating cancer cells is yet another key hallmark of cancer cell metabolism. In the cytoplasm, glutamine is converted to glutamate by glutaminase, and transported into the mitochondria where it is converted to the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate, and also acts as a source of substrates for macromolecule synthesis. Glutamate is also a key substrate of the glutathione-dependent antioxidant system that is the primary intracellular antioxidant mechanism, and that is critical to cellular protection from ROS. Recent studies have also shown that glutamine is an important component in several signaling pathways involved in cell growth including mTOR and ERK pathways, and glutamine uptake and degradation are controlled via c-myc regulation. The increased mitochondrial ROS production in metastatic cells has also been associated with the corresponding upregulation of cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms. In particular, the synthesis of GSH is significantly increased by the enhanced uptake of rate-limiting cystine through the action of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system x C −, which is frequently upregulated in cancer cells. This increased antioxidant capacity has been implicated in cellular resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy that induce cancer cell death by initiating oxidative stress. In addition, it was recently found that the abundant glutamate excreted as a byproduct of cystine uptake by system x C − in cancer cells may also initiate several significant pathologies of metastatic tumours including excitotoxic cell death in tumours of the CNS, and disruption of bone cell signaling in metastatic tumours in the bone. 2.2. Genomics of Mitochondrial DNA: Mutations and Polymorphisms The circular mtgenome encodes 37 genes including several components of the electron transport chain (ETC), tRNAs, and rRNAs. Additionally, mtDNA contains a non-coding region comprised of two hypervariable regions within a displacement loop (D-loop), which is the location of the origin of replication and transcriptional promoters. Mutations in mtDNA are frequently observed in cancer, likely due to the lack of introns, lack of histone protection, and close proximity to damaging ROS. Each cell contains multiple copies of mitochondrial genes, giving rise to mitochondrial homoplasmy, where all the mitochondria of a cell have the same genomic composition, or heteroplasmy, where wild-type and mutant mtDNA coexist. Thus is it possible for a mutation that confers a distinct advantage for cancer cells, such as accelerated growth or enhanced survival, to be clonally expanded to become a homoplasmic mutant and to predominate within a population of cancer cells. Alternatively, Coller and colleagues used a mathematical model to show that random segregation of mtgenomes during rapid tumour development could result in a mutant homoplasmic population without the need for a selective advantage. Regardless of the existence of background homoplasmic mutations that confer no functional consequence, there are numerous mtDNA mutations that result in significant alterations in mitochondrial function that affect tumour development and progression.  In certain cancer tissues mtDNA mutations were more readily detectable and abundant than mutated nuclear p53 DNA, suggesting that mtDNA mutations could serve as excellent cancer biomarkers, particularly for early detection. The most commonly mutated or deleted region of mtDNA in cancer is within the D-loop at the D310 tract, which is a mononucleotide cytidine repeat at position 310. As the D-loop is involved in mitochondrial replication, mutations in this region could also affect mtDNA copy number, though this theory has yet to be proven empirically. In one study, colorectal cancer patients with D-loop mutations were found to have significantly lower overall survival rates and increased chemotherapeutic resistance compared to patients who's mtDNA did not harbour such mutations. The high frequency of D-loop deletion or insertion somatic mutations in cancer render these mutations unlikely to confer any functional impairment to mitochondria, and so the uncertain functional consequences of these mutations should remain an important area for mitochondrial research in cancer. The importance of mitochondrial polymorphisms in cancer development and risk is intimately related to evolutionary haplogroups, and has recently been a contentious area of research. Haplogroups are characterized by a specific mutation that occurs widely within individuals of a particular population, and are further divided into haplotypes generally based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Among the main European haplotypes, the A12308G mutation in tRNALeu2 common to haplotype U was associated with increased risk of both renal and prostate cancers. The NADH-ubiquinone oxioreductase chain 3 (ND3) substitution mutation at G10398A has been associated with increased breast cancer risk in both African American and Indian women. In European-American women the A10398G ND3 substitution conferred increased risk of breast cancer, as did the T16519C D-loop polymorphism. A comprehensive study of pancreatic cancer risk revealed associations with the A331T substitution in mitochondrial ND2. Despite these promising findings, and because the majority of mtDNA polymorphisms are functionally inconsequential, associations with specific polymorphisms and cancer risk have been subject to heated debate. Several older studies involving association of specific polymorphisms with cancer risk have been heavily scrutinized due to erroneous experimental design, interpretation, and poor data quality. However, due to the potential usefulness of somatic mtDNA mutational profiling as a diagnostic tool, the study of mitochondrial somatic mutations and associations with cancer should remain an important focus of cancer biomarker research pending proper study design, population stratification, and independent replication of results. Interestingly, one study reports that one well characterized pathological mtgenome alteration, A3243G, drives mtDNA depletion.  Mitochondrial depletion, a hallmark of cancer initiation and malignant development, is characterized by a wide range of mtDNA deletions. In prostate cancer, a cascade of both large and small-scale deletions reduce cellular mtDNA. This reduction is associated with androgen independence which facilitates disease progression. Consistent with these findings, a 3.4kb mtgenome deletion is currently being used by many urologists to identify the presence and/or absence of prostate cancer in patients with an initial benign biopsy. Contrary to a negative outcome these patients remain highly suspicious for disease by other clinical parameters.  2.3. Mithondrial Genome Sequencing Homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations have been reported in the mtgenomes of patient tumors, and improved patient outcomes have been demonstrated using mtDNA mutation identification for early detection of solid tumours. Clinically, the detection of mtDNA mutations could be reliably used to compare differences in healthy and cancerous tissues, used to monitor mutations in high-risk, asymptomatic patients, or to monitor cancer patients for recurrence of the disease. Although mtDNA mutations have been reported in a wide variety of human cancers extending early detection to cancer prevention has proved problematic with regards to linking homoplasmic or heterplasmic variations with the etiology of cancer. Thus the characterization of populations of mtDNA variation would facilitate broad acceptance of mtDNA analysis.  Initial studies on whole mtgenome analysis established protocols for directly sequencing entire mtgenomes to detect sequence changes. For example, age-matched individuals with lung cancer had strikingly different mtgenome signatures, suggesting that these variants could be cancer-associated changes. To evaluate progression of mtDNA mutation load associated with tumor stage progression, mtDNA mutation type and location across the entire mtgenome were evaluated between individuals with different stages and different types of cancer. Sequence variants were identified in stage I to stage IV tumor samples, and these mutations were distributed across the entire mtgenome with no indication of a hotspot or specific site of mutation associated with specific cancer types or stages. Analysis across larger genome regions indicated a significant clustering of mtDNA mutations in the ND gene complex, while 10% of mitochondrial mutations were found in the D-loop region.   The importance of whole genome analysis can be recognized in analogous measurements of entire mtgenomes. In human forensics, sequencing entire mtgenome is more effective because polymorphisms in mtgenomes can be useful for resolving individuals who have the identical hypervariable (HV) HV1 and HV2 control region sequences. Using the whole genome as a potential source of mutations improves the discrimination power of forensic assays, and by extension cancer diagnostics, prognostics and tumor profiling. Figure 1 illustrates the advantage of whole genome analysis. All ten samples have identical D-loop mutation patterns and types, thus these samples are not distinguishable with only partial mtgenome analysis. As whole mtgenome sequencing is ubiquitous, easy to perform, and high-throughput for even small genomes, whole mtgenome sequencing should be the standard.  2.4. Considerations for Mitochondrial DNA Analysis Proper analysis of mtgenome mutations is required for accurate correlation of homoplasmic mutations with tumor tissue and stage (Figure 2). Mutations are detected by comparing DNA sequence of tumor tissue to that of normal tissue or blood from the same individual. It is important to use blood as control tissue measurements because it is necessary to subtract out mtDNA variation that arises from accumulation of damage over the lifespan, for example, due to aging. Direct analysis of haplogroups associated with cancer does not establish a correlation with variation of mtgenomes metastasis. Comparison of control tissue to tumor tissue must be conducted with such samples collected from the same individual. Accurate detection of mtDNA mutations must account for other sources of errors, for example nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (numts) are sources of contamination during PCR amplification. This warrants careful experimental design and cautious interpretation of heteroplasmic results. Hence, mtgenome disease-associated biomarkers must be authenticated to preclude false-positive detection of paralogous nuclear pseudogenes. 2.5. Cancer Field Effect Another important reason to characterize entire mtgenomes is because of occurrence of mtDNA mutations that could be part of a cancer field effect within tissue. These mutations could be biomarkers for progressive mutation patterns in lesions. However, correlation between single mutation sites and specific gradings remains loosely associated. Instead of attempting to define hotspots for mutations, the gradual accumulation of mutation(s) distributed across entire genomes could be considered as an “individualized” marker of progression. Studies have reported no correlation of tumor-associated mtDNA mutations with respect to patient age. The mutation load or population are uniquely attributed to each starting point, and thereafter constrained by risk and rate based on initial populations. While mutation load is individualized, DNA damage may not be compartmentalized to one site. Although low sensitivity assays and limited sampling have plagued the majority of mtgenome comparative studies, not every tumor possessed sequence variants, while some samples contained a number of variants.   Analysis for identical damage in different tissues (cancer versus control) could be more apparent with analysis of populations of mtgenomes that indicate tissue predisposed to cancer. Absence of a 1 : 1 correlation between the mutation patterns of tumor progression is likely a result of tissue sampling. Hence, population analyses would facilitate characterization of specific locations and surrounding tissues. In summary, there are salient considerations for mtDNA mutation identification comparative studies between potential cancer tissue, different types and stages of tumors, as well as non-invasive collected samples and experimental controls. It is imperative to incorporate analysis of the entire mtgenome and accurate identification of heteroplasmic mitochondrial populations. Additionally, the sampling of bodily fluids and tissues surrounding cancerous tissue will facilitate defining the extent of the cancer field effect.  The derivation of sequence changes in the mtgenome in cancer remains unclear. Should these changes prove to be clonal expansions of a heteroplasmy already present in the tissue rather than tumour-associated in situ mutations, early detection of cancer may thus rely on the ability to differentiate levels of heteroplasmy. In general, studies of mtDNA mutations in cancer indicate the presence of sequence variants spanning the entire mtgenome, and therefore full genome sequencing will provides the cancer diagnostic community with a useful biomarker discovery approach. Such characterization of populations would be useful to define PCR panels for inexpensive triage and screening of human populations. The sensitivity of mutation detection, rates as little as 2% contribution to the admixture of normal and tumor DNA, indicate heterogeneous biological samples such as bodily fluids, lavage specimens, fine-needle aspirates, or biopsies can potentially be analyzed for cancer-associated mitochondrial DNA mutations. The identified heteroplasmic and homoplasmic sequence variants from tumors and blood (control) and urine (for matched bladder cancer) and bronchoalveolar lavage (for matched lung cancer) were measured from the same individual. It is a reasonable assumption that heteroplasmies should comprise multiple subpopulations of mutated mtDNA molecules. Research that incorporated whole mtgenome analysis using sensitive methods describes sequence variant identification of both heteroplasmic and homoplasmic sequence variants in clinical samples distributed across the mtgenome. Hence, small cohort studies that use incomplete mtgenome sequencing or methods designed to scan discrete portions of the genome, miss important sequence variants associated with cancer or other diseases. It is now possible to screen populations to understand specific frequencies and distributions, and to compare sequences of entire mtgenomes in order to have a comprehensive characterization of sample material. Finally, on account mtDNA mutations are well validated, mitochondrial research is beginning to concentrate on understanding the link between mitochondrial function and pathological states. There are a few studies that have begun to address the association of mitochondrial function with change in homeostasis, as well as mitochondrial redox state. As technology improves to allow the accurate assessment of cellular interaction and hemodynamics, monitoring the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction in combination with using mtgenome mutation diagnostics on the pathophysiology of cancer cells will begin to support medical decision-making.  2.6. Mitochondrial Proteomics The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and imported to the mitochondria to perform their specific functions. Thus the mitochondrial proteome is the result of complex crosstalk between both nuclear and mitochondrial programs, and is greatly influenced by pathological conditions including cancer. In the past decade, the mitochondrial proteome has been characterized from highly purified mitochondria resulting in a comprehensive list of over 1,000 mitochondrial proteins (as reviewed in). Using the wealth of knowledge from such studies, numerous databases have been created such as MitoInteractome, MitoP2, HMPDb, and MitoMiner. The MitoInteractome database contains 6,549 protein sequences derived from mutltiple databases (SwissProt, MitoP, MitoProteome, HPRD, GO) from several different species creating a comprehensive protein-protein interaction network. Certainly one of the most extensive databases, MitoP2 contains data from a wide breadth of mitochondrial proteomic studies spanning from single protein studies to extensive proteome-wide mapping and expression studies. The HMPDb (Human Mitochondrial Protein Database) provides consolidated information on mitochondrial DNA sequences, polymorphisms, disease-related proteins, and 3-D mitochondrial protein structures. Collectively these databases serve as wonderful utilities for the discovery and characterization of novel mitochondrial biomarkers for diagnosis and molecular targets for drug treatments.  Extensive protein expression differences have been found in mitochondrial glycolytic enzymes, heat-shock proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, and antioxidant enzymes through comparative proteomic analysis. In regards to metabolism, proteins of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways tend to be induced, along with reductions in oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Recently, Chen et al. (2011) performed 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to compare the proteomic profile of purified mitochondria from normal breast cells (MCF10A), non-invasive breast cancer cells (MCF7), and invasive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). The most differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins between normal and cancerous cells included cytochrome oxidase subunit 5B, malate dehydrogenase, and elongation factor Tu. Several proteomic studies have shown a significant correlation between high levels of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP-70) in a variety of cancers including gastric adenocarcinoma, hepatocarcinoma, and oesophageal cancer. HSP-70 functions as a mediator of cell proliferation, cellular senescence, and cellular immortalization, and when concentrated in to cytoplasm sequesters p53 and activates Ras-Raf signaling which controls cell proliferation.  Recent observations and interest in mitochondrial research has generated a lot of enthusiasm and hope that novel therapeutic agents will be identified that are effective for cancer therapy. In a general sense a dynamic and bidirectional exchange between the metabolic status of the cell generated by mitochondria and genetic profile of a cell will provide a better understanding of metabolites and unexplored signaling mechanisms. Hence a complete understanding of the mitochondrial proteome and its regulation by metabolites, including ROS, will provide a better understanding of the symbiotic relationship that has evolved in eukaryotic cells. Additionally, recent advances in high-throughput technologies, such as next-gen sequencing and Mitochip, have allowed for the rapid and accurate detection of mtDNA mutations, polymorphisms, or copy number variations in a variety of tissues and bodily fluids.",4289
31337008,"1. Introduction Mitochondrial DNA encode genes for two ribosomal RNAs and the 22 transfer RNAs, as well as the 13 proteins of mitochondrial respiratory process, i.e., oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. Of the five enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory process, OXPHOS complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the largest enzyme, and is crucial for cellular metabolism by oxidising NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced) and regenerating the NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidised) pool in the mitochondrial matrix. A deficiency in complex I, caused by either the nuclear encoded genome or mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), is reportedly associated with mitochondrial disorders both in children and adults, including Leigh syndrome, cardiomyopathy and encephalomyopathies. In addition, the link between mutations in complex I and ageing has been shown in a number of studies using different model systems. Mutations in genes encoding subunits of complex I reportedly increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and extend lifespan in worms and flies by independent mechanisms. Nuo-6 (qm200) worms, carrying a mutation in a conserved subunit of complex I, exhibit an extended lifespan by reducing oxygen consumption and decreasing complex I activities. Flies with a knocked down expression of NDUFS1 (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1), a component of complex I, exhibited a longer lifespan via an increased mitochondrial unfolding protein response and the repression of insulin signalling. Other studies showed that the stability of complex I is a critical factor for the extension of lifespan of mice and worms. In these two studies, opposite theories are suggested. The former indicates that the instability of complex I results in reduced ROS production, which extends the lifespan in mice, while the latter shows that the destabilisation of the complex leads to a shortened lifespan in worms. In addition, a recent study demonstrated that increased ROS production, specifically from complex I reverse electron transport, extends lifespan in flies. Apart from studies of nuclear genome encoded complex I genes, mtDNA encoded complex I genes are also reportedly involved in ageing, and this is supported by several studies exhibiting an association between mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms and lifespan in different ethnic populations. These include the A variation at m.5178 in the ND2 gene (MT-ND2) accumulating in Japanese centenarians, and the A variation at m.9055 in the ATP6 gene (MT-ATP6) in French Caucasian centenarians. More recently, a gene-wise analysis of mtDNA in a Turkish population over 90 years of age revealed that nonsynonymous mutations in complex I genes were enriched. Interestingly, most of these variants exhibit protective effects against ageing and age-related diseases, such as reduced lipid levels (anti-atherogenic) and protection from Parkinson’s disease. In addition, variations in mtDNA encoded complex I genes are reportedly associated with age-related diseases, such as metabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes) and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease), in humans. Previous studies using model organisms reveal that mutations in mtDNA encoded complex I genes controlled lifespan in worms and fruit flies, while no studies have been conducted in mammalian models to date. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of mtDNA encoded complex I genes on ageing in mice using conplastic mouse strains carrying different single point homoplasmic mutations in complex I genes on the same nuclear background of C57BL/6J, i.e., C57BL/6J-mtALR/LtJ (B6-mtALR) and C57BL/6J-mtBPL/1J (B6-mtBPL). The former carries a homoplasmic mutation in mtDNA encoded NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (mt-Nd2), and the latter has a homoplasmic mutation in the mtDNA encoded NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 gene (mt-Nd5). We specifically selected these conplastic strains to compare because they differ only in complex I genes (Table S1). 3. Results 3.1. A Mutation in the mt-Nd2 Gene Results in a Shorter Lifespan in Mice First, to evaluate the impact of mutations in complex I genes on lifespan in mice, we performed a longevity study using a large cohort of the two conplastic mouse strains carrying a mutation in mt-Nd2 (B6-mtALR) and mt-Nd5 and (B6-mtBPL). The female B6-mtALR mice lived approximately 60 days shorter than the B6-mtBPL mice did (median survival: 829 days in B6-mtBPL and 772 days in B6-mtALR; p = 0.0400, log-rank test; Figure 1A and Table S3), while this significant difference was not observed in males or a sex-mixed analysis (p = 0.4923, and p = 0.1532, respectively; Figure 1B,C). In both strains, the incidence of spontaneous age-related diseases (i.e., tumours, ulcerative dermatitis and arthritis, Figure S1A) and the ageing score (Figure S1B) were comparable. The days of vaginal patency and plasma IGF-1 levels in differently aged females showed no difference between the strains (Figure S1C,D). 3.2. The mt-Nd2 Mutant Mice Exhibited Mitochondrial Functional Differences under Stress Conditions Next, we investigated the functional consequence of the mt-Nd2 variant in the liver mitochondria obtained from the two conplastic mouse strains. Because a significant effect on lifespan was observed only in female mice, only female mice were used in the mitochondrial functional study exclusively. The mitochondrial OXPHOS complex activities values were normalised to the individual values of the citrate synthase (CS) activities. No difference was observed in the levels of the OXPHOS complex enzyme activities (values normalized with CS) between the B6-mtBPL and B6-mtALR mice in both age groups, except that there was an age-dependent increase in complex III activity levels in both strains (descriptive p = 0.0011, young B6-mtALR vs. aged B6-mtALR; descriptive p = 0.0004, young B6-mtBPL vs. aged B6-mtBPL; one-way ANOVA, Figure 2A). A Western blot analysis of the liver and heart proteins prepared from the young (3–4 months of age) and aged (18–22 months of age) mice revealed unaltered levels of the OXPHOS complex subunit proteins between the strains in both age groups (Figure 2B,C). The protein levels of three other subunits of mitochondrial complex I protein levels were also evaluated, and no differences were observed between the strains regardless their age group (Figure 2C, right panel). Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated from the B6-mtBPL and B6-mtALR mice, and skin fibroblasts cell lines (B6-mtBPL and B6-mtALR) were generated from these primary fibroblasts. Each cell line carried the distinct mtDNA mutations as those in parental mouse strain (Table S1). A cellular flux analysis of the conplastic fibroblast cell lines demonstrated that the levels of maximal respiration and the spare capacity in B6-mtALR fibroblasts exhibited a decreasing trend compared to those in the B6-mtBPL fibroblasts (Figure 2D). Next, primary lymphocytes were isolated from the B6-mtBPL and B6-mtALR mice, and the mitochondrial superoxide levels were measured by flow cytometry using MitoSOX at the basal (i.e., immediately after the preparation) and immunologically activated (i.e., 24 h after culturing with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies) status. The activated cells from the B6-mtALR mice produced less mitochondrial superoxide than did those from B6-mtBPL mice (descriptive p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA; Figure 2E, left). The fold change of increase for superoxide production was lower in the B6-mtALR lymphocytes than that in the B6-mtBPL cells (descriptive p = 0.0005, t-test; Figure 2E, right). The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured using the same batch of primary lymphocytes used for the superoxide assay. The MMP was increased by the activation, while no difference in the levels of MMP was observed between the strains (descriptive p = 0.1457, two-way ANOVA; Figure 2F, left). When the fold change of the MMP levels upon the activation was compared, the B6-mtALR primary lymphocytes were less abundant than were the B6-mtBPL lymphocytes (descriptive p = 0.0445, t-test; Figure 2F, right). 3.3. Higher Levels of Tryptophan Were Observed in the Cells Carrying the mt-Nd2 Mutation Regeneration of NAD+ is one of the critical functions of mitochondrial complex I. To evaluate whether mutations in complex I affect this function, we determined the NAD+ and NADH levels in the liver tissues obtained from the B6-mtBPL and B6-mtALR female mice. No difference was observed in the NAD+/NADH ratio between the strains (Figure 3A, Figure S2A). To also obtain insights into the biosynthetic pathways leading to NAD+, the levels of tryptophan—an essential amino acid that is degraded into NAD+ —was determined by NMR in the skin fibroblast conplastic cell lines carrying the mt-Nd5 mutation or the mt-Nd2 mutation (Figure 3B). The levels of tryptophan in the cells carrying the mt-Nd2 mutation were identified to be higher than those in mt-Nd5 mutant cells (descriptive p = 0.0295, t-test; Figure 3B,C), suggesting the m.4738C>A mutation may have an impact on tryptophan metabolism, without altering NAD+ levels. 3.4. Ageing-Related Pathways and Mitochondrial Functional Pathways Are Altered in mt-Nd2 Mutant Mice Next, we performed RNA-seq on the liver-isolated RNA obtained from the female B6-mtBPL and B6-mtALR mice at the age of 3 to 4 months to elucidate the pathways involved in the mt-Nd2-related phenotypes. Of the 13,967 expressed genes, 35 genes were differentially expressed between the B6-mtBPL and B6-mtALR mice (q < 0.05; Figure 4A, Data S1). The genes upregulated in the B6-mtALR mice included G0s2, Leap2, Usmg5, Chchd1 and ribosomal protein genes (Data S1). G0s2, a G0/G1 switch gene 2, shows an inhibitory capacity for the lipolytic enzyme adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and the deletion of G0s2 ameliorates high-fat diet induced body weight gain and insulin resistance. Leap2 (liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2) was recently revealed as an endogenous antagonist of the ghrelin receptor, controlling the blood glucose levels depending upon the nutrient status, and Usmg5 (upregulated during skeletal muscle growth 5) is also increased in B6-mtALR mice. The gene encodes the protein USMG5, which is also called DAPIT (diabetes-associated protein in insulin-sensitive tissues). This protein was initially discovered in insulin-sensitive tissues of the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and its expression is reportedly higher in cells with a highly aerobic metabolism. These findings indicate that the mutation in mt-Nd2 has an influence on lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as ATP production in the respiratory chain. Chchd1 (coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing 1) is one of the recently identified mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, MRPS37, suggesting that the mt-Nd2 variant affects mitochondrially encoded protein expression as well. Pathways upregulated in the B6-mtALR mice included the OXPHOS, MYC target, fatty acid metabolism, E2F target and mTORC1 signalling pathways (Figure 4B). The oncogene MYC reportedly targets genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, i.e., protein import, complex assembly and mitochondrial transcription/translation. Recent studies showed that E2F regulates genes involved in mitochondrial functions via directly binding to their promoter regions (e.g., COX8 and CYB5-M), and through interactions with key regulatory factors of mitochondrial biogenesis, such as NRF1/2 and PGC-1 beta. These pathway analysis data are in line with the phenotypes observed in the B6-mtALR mice, i.e., shorter lifespan (Figure 1) and altered mitochondrial functions (Figure 2). An additional pathway analysis using a different database also pointed in the same direction, i.e., the upregulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics in B6-mtALR mice (Figure S3A,B) 3.5. Earlier Onset of Glucose Intolerance Is Induced by High-Fat Diet Feeding in B6-mtALR Mice Lastly, to investigate whether the lifespan-linked mt-Nd2 mutation also contributes to other age-related phenotypes, we induced a diet-induced diabetes model in the female B6-mtALR and B6-mtBPL mice. The high-fat diet (HFD) or control diet (CD) was started when mice were 4 weeks old. The HFD-fed mice acquired more body mass than did those fed the CD, while there was no strain difference in the HFD- nor CD-fed mice (Figure 5A). After 8 weeks of HFD feeding, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed, and the levels of glucose intolerance in the B6-mtALR mice were higher than those in the B6-mtBPL mice, with a different time course in both strains (main effect of the strains: descriptive p = 0.0238, interaction between strains and time: descriptive p < 0.0001, two-way nonparametric analysis of variance; Figure 5B). The levels of glucose and insulin in the morning-fasted serum samples were comparable between the two strains in the HFD-fed (Figure 5C), CD-fed groups (Figure S4A), and in random-fed groups (Figure S4B). The fructosamine levels were also unaltered between the random-fed B6-mtBPL and B6-mtALR mice (Figure S4B), confirming that the basal glucose levels are similar between the strains. The lipid parameter assays revealed that the levels of total cholesterol in the HFD-fed mice mildly increased (Figure 5D) compared with those in the CD-fed mice (Figure S4C) and random-fed mice (Figure S4D). Interestingly, the levels of total cholesterol and high-density cholesterol (HDL) were lower in the HFD-fed B6-mtALR mice than those in the HFD-fed B6-mtBPL mice (descriptive p = 0.0057 and 0.0038, respectively, t-test; Figure 5D), while the levels of low-density cholesterol (LDL) were unaltered, resulting in a lower ratio of HDL to LDL in the B6-mtALR mice compared to that in the B6-mtBPL mice (descriptive p = 0.0054, t-test; Figure 5D). Changes in total cholesterol and the ratio of HDL to LDL were not detected in the CD-fed groups and random-fed groups (Figure S4C,D). Despite the unchanged triglyceride levels between the HFD-fed B6-mtALR and HFD-fed B6-mtBPL mice, we observed that HFD-fed B6-mtALR mice exhibited lower levels of free fatty acid than did the HFD-B6-mtBPL mice (descriptive p = 0.0115, t-test; Figure 5C), but this did not occur in the CD-fed mice (Figure S4C), suggesting impaired beta oxidation in the B6-mtALR mice under metabolic stress. Cellular flux analysis was assessed in the primary hepatocytes isolated from the mice fed with HFD over 8 weeks, indicating the lower levels of basal respiration (descriptive p = 0.0389, t-test; Figure 5E) and OXPHOS-linked ATP levels (descriptive p = 0.0446, t-test; Figure 5F) in the cells prepared from the B6-mtALR mice than those in the cells from the B6-mtBPL mice. We also observed a mildly delayed glucose clearance in the CD-fed B6-mtALR compared to that of the CD-fed B6-mtBPL mice again with a different time course in both strains (main effect of the strains: descriptive p = 0.0062, interaction between the strains and time: descriptive p = 0.0017, two-way nonparametric analysis of variance; Figure S4E). Furthermore, two independent IPGTT experiments, using regular chow-fed B6-mtBPL and B6-mtALR mice, demonstrated a pattern of glucose clearance that was similar to that of the CD-fed mice (main effect of the strains: descriptive p = 0.3062, interaction between the strains and time: descriptive p = 0.0056, two-way nonparametric analysis of variance, Figure S4F), confirming that the impaired glucose metabolism was caused by the mutation in mt-Nd2. In line with this result, an indirect calorimetric cage analysis of the regular-chow-fed B6-mtBPL and B6-mtALR mice showed lower levels of respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in the B6-mtALR mice compared with those in the B6-mtBPL mice, indicating the preference of fat to glucose as an energy source in the B6-mtALR mice (descriptive p = 0.0382, t-test, Figure S4G). We did not observe any difference in energy expenditure, locomotor activity, or food intake levels other than water intake (Figure S4H–K).",2411
31235686,"Introduction Cardiovascular diseases are considered the main causes of human mortality worldwide. Mitochondrial-based disturbances in energy supply, calcium homeostasis, reactive oxygen species generation and cell death have major roles in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of mitochondrial energy homeostasis are not fully understood. The human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) consists of a circular molecule of 16,569 bp encoding 13 proteins, which is required for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The OXPHOS system contains five multiple subunit enzyme complexes, including complexes I, II, III, IV, and V, and one or more of the core subunits for the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) is encoded by mtDNA, such as the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) protein, which is a core assembly subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and is essential for catalyzing NADH dehydrogenation and electron transfer to ubiquinone to produce ATP. Previous reports showed that mutated ND2 impairs mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I assembly, contributing to Leigh syndrome. The mutant ND2 can increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In addition, ND2 is involved in numerous diseases, including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. Japanese individuals with the ND2 mutant have been reported to exhibit a low prevalence of myocardial infarction. However, the molecular mechanism of ND2 in myocardial infarction remains to be fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that act as negative post-transcriptional gene regulators by inhibiting mRNA translation or promoting mRNA degradation. Several reports have revealed that miRNAs play a vital role in mitochondrial ATP production, including miR-15b, miR-16, miR-195, and miR-424. The electron transport chain (ETC) is required for mitochondria to produce ATP via mitochondrial OXPHOS. However, various studies have shown that miRNAs regulate mitochondrial OXPHOS by directly targeting the ETC components in cardiomyocytes. MiR-181c can regulate myocardial mitochondrial energy metabolism by targeting the mRNA of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1). Our present work revealed that nuclear miR-762 was translocated into the mitochondria and upregulated in response to A/R treatment. Knockdown of endogenous miR-762 significantly attenuated the decrease in intracellular ATP levels, the increase in ROS levels, the decrease in mitochondrial complex I enzyme activity and the increase in apoptotic cell death in cardiomyocytes, which was induced by A/R treatment. Similarly, knockdown of endogenous miR-762 ameliorated cardiac function in mice. Furthermore, enforced expression of miR-762 dramatically attenuated expression of ND2 by binding to the coding sequence (CDS) of ND2 mRNA. Taken together, our results showed that a novel nuclear miR-762 translocates into the mitochondria and regulates apoptosis and myocardial infarction by impairing ND2 and may serve as a new therapeutic target for myocardial infarction. Results MiR-762 predominantly translocates into the mitochondria and is upregulated upon A/R treatment Myocardial apoptosis mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction is an important mechanism for the initiation and progression of heart failure. MiRNAs act as negative regulators of gene expression and play a vital role in the development of heart failure. To explore whether miRNAs participate in the regulation of cardiac mitochondrial function upon A/R treatment, we performed a microarray assay to detect mitochondrial miRNAs in response to A/R treatment (supplementary Table). We identified 15 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in A/R treatment relative to normal cardiomyocytes (fold changes > 2); 9 of these were significantly upregulated, and the other 6 were downregulated (supplementary Table). These data suggest that these 15 miRNAs may be associated with A/R-mediated cardiac mitochondrial function. To confirm the microarray data, we performed quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to verify the mitochondrial miRNA levels. Consistent with the microarray data, miR-762, miR-744, miR-92a, miR-1892, miR-150, miR-669a, miR-296–3p, miR-711, and miR-450a-3p levels were significantly upregulated in cardiomyocytes upon A/R treatment (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, the role of miR-762 in cardiac mitochondria upon A/R treatment remains unclear. Thus, we chose miR-762 to investigate its functions in cardiac mitochondria following A/R treatment. First, we examined miR-762 expression both in total cardiomyocyte and mitochondrial fractions using qRT-PCR and observed that miR-762 was enriched primarily in the cell mitochondria (Fig. 1b). Second, miR-762 was dramatically upregulated both in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions using qRT-PCR upon A/R treatment (Fig. 1c). Third, fluorescence in situ hybridization (Fig. 1d) with miR-762 probes showed colocalization of miR-762 with the mitochondrial marker (MitoTracker Red). Das et al. demonstrated that Ago2 plays an important role in translocating miRNAs into the mitochondria. Since miR-762 is located on chromosome 7, to confirm whether translocation of miR-762 into the mitochondria was mediated by Ago2, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiment with Ago2 was performed in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1e). As a result, Ago2 immunoprecipitation showed a high abundance of miR-762 compared with normal IgG immunoprecipitation by using qRT-PCR (Fig. 1f). Thus, these findings suggest that miR-762 is present predominantly in the mitochondria and may regulate mitochondrial function in response to A/R-induced injury. MiR-762 regulates mitochondrial function and apoptosis As mentioned above, we observed that A/R treatment induced a significant increase in miR-762 in the mitochondria (Fig. 1a, c). Therefore, we further explored the functional role of miR-762 in the mitochondria. To this end, the antagomir of miR-762 was used to knockdown endogenous miR-762, and we observed that anta-762 dramatically decreased endogenous miR-762 levels both in cardiac cytosol and mitochondria (Fig. 2a). In addition, knockdown of endogenous miR-762 by the antagomir remarkably inhibited the expression of endogenous miR-762 induced by A/R treatment (Fig. 2b). Mitochondria are the center of metabolic signals. In the mitochondrial matrix, tricarboxylic acid circulating enzymes produce electron carriers that form electron transport chains located in the mitochondrial inner membrane to oxygen, which can produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. MiRNAs were shown to act as regulators of mitochondrial function. For example, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-195 and miR-424 have been shown to regulate ATP levels. Thus, we further explored whether miR-762 also acted as a regulator of ATP levels. Our results revealed that knockdown of miR-762 significantly attenuated the decrease in intracellular ATP levels induced by A/R treatment (Fig. 2c). In addition, our results showed that knockdown of miR-762 attenuated the increase in ROS levels in response to A/R treatment (Fig. 2d). Defects in complexes I-IV, including inefficient electron transfer, produce toxic ROS, which lead to loss of energy metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction and even human disease. MiRNAs regulate mitochondrial complexes; for example, mitochondrial complex III was downregulated by miR-210 in mitochondria; mitochondrial complex IV was downregulated by miR-181c, miR-210, and miR-338. To determine whether the enzyme activity of the mitochondrial complex could be affected by miR-762, we examined the enzyme activities of mitochondrial complexes using a microplate assay kit and found that knockdown of miR-762 apparently repressed the decrease in mitochondrial complex I enzyme activity induced by A/R treatment (Fig. 2e). The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) is an important feature of mitochondrial function, reflecting the mitochondrial respiration rate and energy production. Next, using a Seahorse XFp apparatus, we examined miR-762-mediated responses in cardiomyocytes after miR-762 silencing by anta-762. Our results revealed that A/R treatment induced a significant decrease in basal OCR in cardiomyocytes (supplementary Fig. 1a). And knockdown of miR-762 significantly attenuated the decrease in percentage of ATP-linked OCR in response to A/R treatment (supplementary Fig. 1b). In contrast, knockdown of miR-762 markedly inhibited the increase in percentage of proton leak OCR in response to A/R treatment (supplementary Fig. 1c). Thus, these data further demonstrated that miR-762 exhibits a negative effect on complex I enzyme activity and knockdown of miR-762 may raise efficiency in OXPHOS. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-762 markedly suppressed the increase in A/R-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2f). Overall, these data suggest that miR-762 regulates mitochondrial function and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. MiR-762 regulates myocardial infarction and cardiac function Apoptosis plays an important role in post-infarct myocardial remodeling and failure. Preventing myocyte apoptosis contributes to ameliorating cardiac function and cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction. We showed that miR-762 was involved in regulating A/R-induced myocardial apoptosis (Fig. 2f). Thus, we detected miR-762 expression in the myocardial area at risk in response to I/R injury. As expected, miR-762 was elevated in response to I/R injury (Fig. 3a), suggesting that miR-762 has a potential role in promoting myocardial infarction. To explore the pathophysiological role of miR-762, I/R injury was carried out in mice injected with miR-762 antagomir (anta-762) or its control (anta-NC). Our results showed that knockdown of miR-762 by delivery of the antagomir in vivo remarkably attenuated the decrease in complex I enzyme activity (Fig. 3b) and the increase in apoptotic cells, which was induced by I/R injury (Fig. 3c, d). Likewise, myocardial infarction size in anta-762-treated mice significantly decreased compared with the anta-NC-treated group following I/R injury (Fig. 3e). These results suggest that knockdown of miR-762 contributes to reduced myocyte apoptosis and myocardial infarction. Thus, we further explored whether cardiac function was regulated by miR-762. Our results showed that cardiac function was ameliorated in the anta-762-treated group (Fig. 3f), indicating that knockdown of miR-762 ameliorated myocardial I/R injury in mice. Thus, these findings further support our conclusion that miR-762 regulates myocardial infarction and cardiac function. MiR-762 participates in the regulation of ND2 expression The mitochondrial genome contains 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNAs and 22 tRNAs. To determine the mitochondrial targets of miR-762, we performed qRT-PCR experiments to investigate whether the transcripts of all 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes were altered in response to enforced expression of miR-762 by transfection with mimic-762. Our results showed that there was no distinct effect of enforced expression of miR-762 on the transcript levels of 13 mitochondrial protein coding genes (Fig. 4a and supplementary Fig. 2a). Subsequently, we determined the protein levels of all 13 mitochondrial protein coding genes by western blot analysis. We found that compared with the mimic-NC-transfected group, there was a significant reduction in the protein expression of ND2 but no significant effect on other mitochondrial DNA-coded proteins in the mimic-762-transfected group (Fig. 4b and supplementary Fig. 2b). As expected, knockdown of endogenous miR-762 had no striking effect on the transcript levels of endogenous ND2 (Fig. 4c) but effectively increased the protein expression of ND2 (Fig. 4d). Similarly, knockdown of endogenous miR-762 attenuated the reduction in the protein expression of ND2 upon A/R treatment (Fig. 4e). We further carried out the bioinformatic analysis using the RNAhybrid program. Indeed, we noticed that the CDS of ND2 contains a potential binding site for miR-762 (Fig. 4f). Therefore, we investigated the inhibitory mechanism on ND2 translation using a luciferase assay system. We produced a luciferase construct of the wild-type CDS of ND2 (ND2-CDS-wt) and a mutated form (ND2-CDS-mut). The results of the luciferase assay showed that enforced expression of miR-762 significantly inhibited the translation of the luciferase gene containing the wild-type CDS of ND2, indicating that miR-762 directly binds with the wild-type CDS of ND2 (Fig. 4g). Moreover, our results revealed that enforced expression of miR-762 exhibited no distinct effect on the expression of ND2-CDS-mut (supplementary Fig. 3a). In contrast, enforced expression of miR-762 prominently inhibited the expression of ND2-CDS-wt (supplementary Fig. 3b). We further determined intracellular ATP levels, and our results revealed that enforced expression of miR-762 dramatically reduced intracellular ATP levels in the ND2-CDS-wt-transfected group compared with ND2-CDS-mut-transfected group (supplementary Fig. 3c). These findings further support our conclusion that miR-762 directly binds to the CDS of ND2. Collectively, these findings suggest that ND2 is a specific downstream target of miR-762 in the mitochondria. ND2 prevents cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ameliorates cardiac function To explore the role of ND2 in apoptosis under pathological conditions, we observed that A/R dramatically reduced the protein levels of ND2 (Fig. 5a). In contrast, enforced expression of exogenous ND2 significantly attenuated the reduction in ND2 expression induced by A/R treatment (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, we found that enforced expression of ND2 remarkably repressed the decrease in complex I enzyme activity (Fig. 5c) and the reduction in ATP levels, which was induced by A/R treatment (Fig. 5d). In addition, enforced expression of ND2 significantly attenuated A/R-induced apoptotic cell death (Fig. 5e, f). To further explore the function of ND2 in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction, I/R injury was carried out in the animal model. Our results showed that enforced expression of ND2 by delivery of an adenovirus harboring ND2 in vivo resulted in a significant reduction in myocardial infarction sizes following I/R injury (Fig. 5g). In addition, myocardial function was ameliorated in the mice treated with adenoviral delivery of ND2 in response to I/R injury (Fig. 5h). In general, these data suggest that ND2 plays protective roles against I/R injury-induced apoptosis and ameliorates cardiac function. MiR-762 regulates mitochondrial function and apoptosis by ND2 Knockdown of miR-762 significantly attenuated the decrease in ND2 induced by A/R treatment (Fig. 4e). Thus, we further explored whether miR-762 regulates mitochondrial function and apoptosis by ND2. Our results showed that the inhibitory effect of miR-762 downregulation on ND2 protein levels was attenuated by ND2 knockdown (Fig. 6a). As expected, knockdown of miR-762 significantly repressed the decrease in mitochondrial complex I enzyme activity and intracellular ATP levels, which were induced by A/R treatment (Fig. 2c, e and Fig. 6b, c), and the inhibitory effect of miR-762 downregulation was attenuated by ND2 knockdown (Fig. 6b, c). Our results also showed that knockdown of miR-762 significantly inhibited the increase in apoptotic cell death induced by A/R treatment (Fig. 2f and Fig. 6d),and the inhibitory effect of miR-762 downregulation was attenuated by ND2 knockdown (Fig. 6d). Taken together, these data suggest that miR-762 regulates apoptosis and mitochondrial function by ND2.",2211
34336093,"1. Background Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been reported in many diseases such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, maternally inherited deafness, aminoglycoside-induced Deafness, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Mitochondria are the main site of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in eukaryotic cells. Each cell contains 100 to 1000 mitochondria, each containing an independently encoded double-stranded circular DNA. Human (mammalian) mtDNA has 16 569 base pairs with 37 coding genes, including 22 mitochondrial transport RNA (tRNA) genes, two ribosomal RNA (12r RNA and 16r RNA) genes, and 13 peptides associated with the OXPHOS respiratory chain complex. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been proved to be associated with many common human diseases, including diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cancer; neurodegenerative changes; and aging OXPHOS contains approximately 90 proteins, and there is a close association between genes that transcribe and translate OXPHOS-related proteins, including nuclear and mitochondrial genes, to maintain and regulate the metabolic processes. Further research found that the gene defect encoding OXPHOS protein directly leads to impaired OXPHOS function, further leading to a series of problems such as metabolic disorders, and is one of the important causes of various diseases. In our previous study, we found that there is a heteroplasmy level of m. 5178C>A mutation between essential hypertension (EH) and normotensive controls. The heteroplasmy level of MT-ND2 m. 5178C>A in EH patients is much lower than that in control subjects. The MT-ND2 m. 5178C>A polymorphism of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) 237Leu/Met was first reported to be associated with longevity. Recently, the MT-ND2 m. 5178C>A mutation has been found to have protective effects in a variety of diseases such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism of how MT-ND2 m. 5178C>A mutation associated with lots of diseases has not been elucidated. Therefore, we enrolled five cases from the EH group without MT-ND2 m. 5178C>A gene mutation and control groups with m. 5178C>A gene mutation. The gender, age, body mass index, and laboratory indexes were matched in two groups. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were immortalized by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus from the peripheral whole blood of each participant. Then, we investigated the mechanisms of the MT-ND2 m. 5178C>A gene mutation in cell and mitochondrial functions of lymphocyte lines to explain the protective effect of MT-ND2 m. 5178C>A gene mutation in the mechanism against EH. 2. Results 2.1. Clinical Characteristics Basic clinical characteristics were compared between mutant and control groups. Triglyceride, SBP, and DBP were lower in the mutant group than in the control group (Table 1). 2.2. Lymphocyte Line Viability and Proliferation Mitochondrial gene sequence analyses revealed that the mutation group carried the MT-ND2 m. 5178C>A gene mutation (Figure 1(a)). A previous study showed that this site mutation leads to amino acid substitution in the ND2-encoding gene from leucine (Leu) to methionine (Met). To further investigate whether ND2 gene mutations affect cell proliferation, we used the Epstein-Barr virus to infect lymphocytes.  Figure 1(b) shows the proliferation of the two groups after infection. The nucleuses of the mutant lymphocytes were more obvious under high magnification, and the cell membrane boundaries were blurry (Figure 1(b)). Proliferation of the mutant group was significantly higher than that of the control group (34.67 ± 4.16 vs. 20.67 ± 3.06, P = 0.009, Figure 1(c)). 2.3. Lymphocyte Line Proliferation CCK-8 was used to compare the cell viability of mutant and nonmutated lymphocyte lines. Luciferin, the nonluminescent peptide, was transferred to luminescent luciferase and ATP under the action of Caspase 3/7, and the value of Caspase 3/7 is recorded by a Centro LB90 microplate luminometer. The activities of the mutant cells and control group were linearly related to the number of cells. At the same cell number, the activity of the mutant group was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05, Figure 1(d)). 2.4. Lymphocyte Line ATP Synthesis Mitochondria are a cell's powerpacks. To determine whether mitochondrial gene mutation affects the ability of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to synthesize ATP, we measured ATP production by a luciferin/luciferase luminescence assay. There was a linear correlation between ATP production and the cell number in both mutant and control cell lines. ATP production of the mutant cells was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05, Figure 2(a)). 2.5. Lymphocyte Line ROS Synthesis Mitochondrial oxidative stress damage is the most important mechanisms of which mitochondria regulate cell apoptosis. In our study, we measure the intracellular ROS production through fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. The ROS production in the mutant cell line was significantly lower than that in the control cell line (39 ± 13.79 vs. 112.66 ± 23.13, P = 0.001, Figure 2(b)). 2.6. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) means the proton electrochemical gradient of mitochondrial membrane, which is reflective of the functional metabolic status of mitochondria. This assay uses the ratio of red/green fluorescence of JC-10 Ex/Em = 540/590 and 490/525 nm (FL590/FL525) to reflect ΔΨm. The ΔΨm value of the mutant cell line was significantly higher than that of the control group (0.0587 ± 0.0187 vs. 0.0469 ± 0.0165, P = 0.001, Figure 2(c)). 2.7. Apoptosis Protein Caspase 3/7 Activity Another important function of mitochondria is to regulate cell apoptosis. Caspase 3/7 is a specific molecular marker of apoptosis. There was a linear correlation between Caspase 3/7 expression and the cell number in both mutant and control cells. At the same cell number, the expression level of Caspase 3/7 in the mutant group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05, Figure 3(a)). 2.8. The Expression of Proliferation and Apoptosis Genes and Proteins To evaluate the mechanism implicated in the MT-ND2 m. 5178C>A gene mutation decreased apoptosis, we measured the genes of apoptotic signal pathway through transcription and the protein expression. The mutant group showed increased Bcl-2 gene transcription compared with control group (1.58 ± 0.063 vs. 1.00 ± 0.036%, P = 0.0014) (Figure 3(b)). And mutant cells also showed increased Bcl-2 protein level than the control group (Figure 3(c)). 2.9. Apoptosis Assay The apoptosis rate was detected by the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit. Cells that are in early apoptosis are FITC Annexin V positive and PI negative, and cells that are in late apoptosis are both Annexin V and PI positive. The living cell ratio of the mutant group was higher than that of the control group (94.9 ± 4.9% vs. 74 ± 3.20%, P = 0.0229, Figure 3(d)) when the total cell number was almost the same. The early apoptosis and late apoptosis in the mutant group are significant decreased than those in the control group (3.6 ± 0.75% vs. 22.9 ± 3.00%, P = 0.0229; 0.76 ± 0.27% vs. 2.89 ± 0.42%, P = 0.0125, Figure 3(d)). 2.10. Mitochondrial OCR Assay To assess whether the MT-ND2 m. 5178C>A gene mutation affects mitochondrial respiratory functions, we calculated OCR curves of mutants and control cell lines after administration of various inhibitors. Basal OCR refers to the difference in OCR after treatment with rotenone and antimycin A before oligomycin treatment, reflecting the basic OCR of mitochondria. The basal OCR of the mutant group was increased by 42.3% compared with that of the control group (104.39 ± 8.7 vs. 60.6 ± 8.14, P < 0.01, Figure 4). ATP-linked OCR refers to the difference in OCR between oligomycin treatment and posttreatment, reflecting the OCR of mitochondrial OXPHOS coupling. The ATP-linked OCR of the mutant group was increased by 37.7% compared with the control group (50.1 ± 5.65 vs. 35.6 ± 5.03, P < 0.01, Figure 4). The maximum OCR value refers to the difference between the OCR when treated with FCCP and the nonmitochondrial OCR when treated with rotenone and antimycin A, reflecting the buffering capacity of mitochondrial oxygen utilization. The maximal OCR of the mutation group was increased by 50.38% compared with the control group (233.68 ± 35.5 vs. 115.94 ± 16.18, P < 0.01, Figure 4). Proton leak OCR refers to the remaining OCR after treatment with rotenone and antimycin A, reflecting the rate of oxygen consumption not used by mitochondria. The proton leak OCR of the mutant group was increased by 78% compared with that of the control group (45.16 ± 5.65 vs. 9.9 ± 6.27, P < 0.01, Figure 4). Reserve OCR is the difference between maximum and base OCRs, reflecting the buffering capacity of mitochondrial oxygen utilization. The reserve capacity of the mutation group was increased by 57.2% compared with that of the control group (129.41 ± 32.33 vs. 55.33 ± 16.47, P < 0.01, Figure 4). Nonmitochondrial OCR refers to the remaining OCR after treatment with rotenone and antimycin A, reflecting the consumption rate of oxygen that is not used by mitochondria. The nonmitochondrial OCR of the mutant group was increased by 28.2% compared with that of the control group (17.17 ± 7.65 vs. 12.33 ± 4.68, P = 0.149, Figure 4). 2.11. Mitochondrial Complex I Activity To investigate whether C5178A gene mutation influences Mitochondrial Complex I function, we calculate the activity of Mitochondrial Complex I through measuring the oxidation rate of NADH. The activity of Mitochondrial Complex I of the mutant group was increased than that of the control group (2.312e − 005 ± 1.775e − 006 vs. 1.361e − 005 ± 6.19e − 007, P = 0.0369, Figure 5).",1540
32083134,"1. Introduction Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a serious condition which is widespread in China, affecting upwards of 10% of the adult population. This disease is multifactorial in nature, arising in a heterogeneous fashion owing to interactions between both genetic and environmental factors. As T2DM is a serious metabolic disease, and mitochondria serve as invaluable metabolic regulators within cells, these organelles are thought to be central to T2DM pathogenesis. As multiple studies have found that T2DM risk can be transmitted in a matrilineal fashion, this further supports the potential for a mitochondrial role in the development of this serious disease. Indeed, some studies have proposed that mutations within mitochondrial tRNA sequences are key factors influencing the development of T2DM and other metabolic diseases. The 3243A>G, m.3264T>C mutations in the tRNALeu(UUR), m.4291T>C mutation in the tRNAIle, m.14709T>C, m.14692A>G mutations in the tRNAGlu, and m.10003T>C mutation in the tRNAGly have all been identified as potential mutations affecting T2Dm disease predisposition. Exactly how these mutations ultimately contribute to disease onset, however, remains poorly understood, and as such, there is a clear need for additional research into how mitochondrial dysfunction can act to mediate the onset or progression of T2DM. During a T2DM genetic screening effort among 100 Chinese subjects, we were able to detect a G-to-A transition at position 15897 in individuals with a familial history of matrilineal T2DM transmission, as well as a set of variants belonging to the Asian haplogroup D4b1. This mutation is likely to disrupt normal base pairing (10G-25C) for the tRNAThr DHU-stem, thereby resulting in its abnormal functionality and structure, thus likely resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, we should be to explore the function of this m.15897G>A mutation using cybrid cell lines in order to observe the effects of this mutation on mitochondrial functionality, with a particular focus on processes such as mitochondrial tRNAThr levels, protein synthesis and assembly, membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. 3. Results 3.1. Familial T2DM Presentation in a Han Chinese Family We identified a Chinese family SZDM012 that had visited the Diabetes Clinic at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (as shown in Figure 1). This patient underwent full physical examinations in an effort to identify any clinical or genetic factors associated with this instance of familial T2DM. All patients had been diagnosed with T2DM based on standard diagnostic criteria: (1) fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7 mmol/dL, (2) oral glucose tolerance ≥ 1.11 mmol/dL (200 mg/dL), or (3) ≥6.5% glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Patients were diagnosed as having an elevated diabetes risk if they did not have a history of diabetes and met the following criteria: (1) fasting plasma glucose from 5.5-7 mmol/L, (2) 2-hour plasma glucose levels from 0.78-1.11 mmol/dL (140-199 mg/dL), or (3) a HbA1c concentration of 5.7-6.4%. When a total of 10 matrilineal relatives were surveyed, a total of 6 were determined to have T2DM (3 males and 3 females; as shown in Table 1). T2DM symptoms were first diagnosed in these patients at the average age of 57 (range: 43-72), and other matrilineal relatives exhibited an elevated risk of diabetes based on the diagnostic criteria. We did not observe any other significantly abnormal clinical conditions in these related individuals, such as cardiac, muscular, or neurological diseases. No other surveyed members of this family exhibited T2DM, leading to our determination that this family exhibited matrilineally inherited T2DM. 3.2. Identification of T2DM-Associated Mitochondrial Mutations We next sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of the proband SZDM012-III-14 patient in an effort to determine whether there were specific mitochondrial mutations underlying the observed matrilineal T2DM pattern of inheritance. After comparing our sequences from this patient to the Cambridge consensus sequence, as shown in Table 2, we detected a total of 46 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the mitochondrial genome and additionally determined their mitochondrial haplogroup to be the Eastern Asian haplogroup D4b1. Of these 46 mutations, 13 were previously described D-loop variants, 2 were known 12S rRNA gene variants, 2 were known 16SrRNA variants, one was the newly characterized m.15897G>A mutation in the tRNAThr gene (as shown in Figure 2), 27 variants (5 novel and 22 known) including 19 were to be silent variants, and 8 were missense mutations affecting protein-coding genes which were as follows: m.5178C>A(Leu>Met) in the ND2 gene, m.7270T>C(Val-Ala) in the CO1 gene, m.8701A>G(Thr>Ala) and m.8860A>G(Thr>Ala) in the ATP6 gene, m.10398A>G(Thr>Ala) in the ND3 gene, m.14256T>C(Ile>Val) in the ND6 gene, and m.14766C>T(Thr>Ile) in the CYTB gene. These variants were evaluated for the pathogenicity using the following criteria: (1) present in <1% of the controls, (2) evolutional conservation, and (3) potential structural alterations. We next performed phylogenetic comparisons of these variants to known sequences of these same genes in 16 additional primate species in order to establish to what extent they were conserved. The known missense variants were reported polymorphic variation sites. The two novel variants, CO1 m.7270T>C and ND6 m.14256T>C, revealed lowly evolutionary conservation. Therefore, these two variants were likely to be polymorphic. However, the m.15897G>A mutation in the tRNAThr gene exhibited highly evolutionary conservation. We also did not detect this m.15897G>A mutation in 100 Chinese control subjects, and we thus found no evidence that any detected mutation other than m.15897G>A was evolutionarily conserved. 3.3. Altered Conformation and Stability Level of tRNAThr We tested the conformation of tRNAThrin vivo by native polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Figure 2(c), electrophoretic patterns demonstrated that the tRNAThr in three mutant cybrid cell lines carrying the m.15897G>A mutation migrated much slower than those of the control cybrid cell lines. In contrast, the levels of the tRNAIle and tRNAHis were similar with the control cybrid cell lines. Furthermore, we found that mutant cell lines exhibited significantly decreased tRNAThr levels as compared with controls, with the 5S RNA used for normalization within cells (as shown in Figure 3). Indeed, mutant cells exhibited tRNAThr levels which were 51.53% (P < 0.05) of those in control cells following normalization. For comparison, these mutant cells had steady-state tRNAIle, tRNAHis, tRNAGln, and tRNAAla levels of 99.19%, 97.45%, 98.30%, and 101.78%, respectively, relative to control cybrid cell lines (as shown in Figure 3). 3.4. Perturbed Aminoacylation of tRNAThr We investigated the aminoacylation properties of carrying m.15897G>A mutation cybrid cell lines. As shown in Figure 4, the efficiencies of aminoacylated tRNAThr in the mutant cell lines reflected 11.42% decrease, relative to the average values of control cell lines. However, the levels of aminoacylation in tRNAIle and tRNAHis in mutant cell lines were comparable with those in control cell lines. 3.5. Reduced Mitochondrial Protein Levels We next assessed the levels of respiratory complex subunits encoded by the mitochondrial DNA via Western blotting, using VDAC to control for equal protein loading. As shown in Figure 5, we found that levels of four proteins generated by mitochondrial translation in mutant cells were present at average levels 71.71% relative to control cybrid cell lines (P < 0.05). Cells bearing the m.15897G>A mutation also exhibited significant 66.78%, 74.30%, 80.74%, 63.78%, and 35.31% reductions in levels of the proteins ND4, ND1, ND6, ATP6, and CO2, respectively. In contrast, the levels of the CYB protein were not significant with the control cybrid cell lines. However, the levels of polypeptide synthesis in mutant cells showed no significant correlation relative to those in control cells with either the number of codons or the proportion of threonine residues. 3.6. Imbalances in OXPHOS Complexes We measured the steady-state levels of five OXPHOS complexes by Blue Native gel electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 6, the levels of complex I, complex IV, and complex V in the m.15897G>A mutation cell lines were 52.85%, 70.39%, and 54.93% of the levels observed in control cybrid cell lines, respectively. However, the levels of complexes II and III in the mutant cell lines were comparable with those of three control cell lines. 3.7. Mutation Led to Decreased Complex I and IV Activity We further assessed the consequences of this m.15897G>A mutation on oxidative phosphorylation using isolated mitochondrial from our mutant and control cybrid cell lines. As shown in Figure 7, we found that complex I and IV activity in the m.15897G>A mutant mitochondria was 70.63%, and 85.68% of the activity observed in control cybrid cell lines (P < 0.05), whereas no changes in complex II/III activity were observed. 3.8. ATP Generation Is Reduced in Mutant Cells We next assessed how this m.15897G>A influences ATP generation in the mitochondria of affected cells via a luciferin/luciferase assay system. Cells were combined with media containing glucose, with or without oligomycin (to inhibit ATP synthase and promote glycolysis) or a combination of pyruvate and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (to inhibit glycolysis and promote oxidative phosphorylation). As shown in Figure 8, we found that glycolysis activity was comparable between mutant and control cells, whereas ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation was significantly reduced in mutant cybrid cell lines relative to control cybrid cell lines, with ATP production on 70.99% and 75.68% (average 73.37%) that observed in control cells (P = 0.009). 3.9. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Changes We next assessed how m.15897G>A mutations altered mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) with the help of the JC-10 fluorescent probe. As shown in Figure 9, we observed decreased ΔΨm values in mutant cells bearing the m.15897G>A mutation, with decreases averaging 64.04% of control (63.45% and 64.69%) (P < 0.05). We found that ΔΨm in mutant cells treated with FCCP were similar to values in control cells. 3.10. Elevated ROS Production We used flow cytometry to assess ROS production by mutant and control cells but upon H2O2 stimulation and at baseline. As shown in Figure 10, we found that mutant cells bearing the m.15897G>A mutation exhibited increased ROS production, with an average increase of 124.37% (122.45% and 125.67%) relative to control (P < 0.05).",1608
31842766,"Background Different Cardiovascular diseases remain the most prominent cause of death globally, with coronary heart disease (CHD) remaining a highly complex and heterogeneous disease the onset of which is typically influenced by a range of environmental and genetic factors, although in some cases single gene mutations can drive disease. While many studies to date have sought to identify nuclear genomic factors linked with CHD incidence, relatively few studies have specifically investigated CHD risk arising as a consequence of mitochondrial mutations. Such investigations are important, as abnormal mitochondrial functionality has been found to be a potential driver of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Multiple previous studies have identified linked between specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and hypertension, including the tRNAIle 4295A > G mutation, as well as the tRNAIle 4263A > G, tRNAMet/tRNAGln 4401A > G, and tRNAMet 4435A > G mutations which were specifically linked to hypertension in Chinese individuals. To explore additional mutations linked with CHD pathogenesis, we are conducting ongoing systematic screening efforts assessing mtDNA mutations among Chinese CHD patients. As a part of this effort, we have identified one three-generation family presenting with evidence of CHD transmitted matrilineal, with 6/24 analyzed adults in this family exhibiting CHD of varying severity. When we analyzed their mtDNA, we detected the presence of a tRNAThr 15910C > T mutation of the M7b’c haplogroup. This mutation occurred in the stem region of this tRNA (conventional position 25) a site that is highly conserved and the mutation of which is predicted to result in structural and functional changes that have the potential to disrupt normal mitochondrial functionality. After identifying this mutation we followed up on its biological significance in cybrid cell lines bearing this mutation, measuring the effects of this15910C > T mutation on tRNAThr levels, enzymatic activity of electron transport chain complexes, membrane permeability, and the mitochondria-mediated generation of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Results Clinical presentation The proband (Q5-III-3) was first diagnosed with CHD upon presenting at the Cardiology Clinic of affiliated hospital of Qingdao university, after which he underwent a full medical evaluation. The patient was diagnosed with hypertension (159/99 mmHg), significant ischemia (65% narrowing was evident upon coronary angiography), and high cholesterol (LDL-C = 159 mg/dL, TC = 232 mg/dL). The patient was not affected by any other comorbid conditions such as diabetes or neurological disease. When family members of this patients were evaluated for these same conditions, 5 were diagnosed with all three of these conditions (Fig. 1a and Table 1). In each case, any fathers with CHD had not transmitted it to their children, whereas mothers did transmit it, suggesting matrilineal inheritance consistent with mitochondrial involvement in this inherited CHD risk.  Analysis of mitochondrial mutations To explore potential mitochondrial mutations linked with inherited CHD risk, we sequenced the mitochondrial genome of this proband patient Q5-III-3. A total of 45 mutations were evident in their mitochondrial genome upon comparison with the revised Cambridge consensus sequence (NC_012920), and the mitochondrial haplogroup for this patient was identified to be M7b’c (Fig. 2). As shown in Table 2, of these 45 variants, 19 were known silent variants, 14 were known D-loop variants, 8 were known missense mutations affecting protein-coding genes, 2 were known 12S rRNA variants, 1 was a known 16 s rRNA variant, and one was a novel homoplasmy 15910C > T mutation in the tRNAThr gene (Fig. 1b). The detected missense mutations were as follows: 5460G > A (Ala331Thr) in the ND2 gene, 7853G > A (Val90Ile) in the CO2 gene, the 8701A > G (Thr59Ala) in the ATP6 gene, the 10398A > G (Thr114Ala) in the ND3 gene, 12,811 T > C (Tyr159His) in the ND5 gene, the 14766C > T (Thr > Ile), 14978A > G (Ile78Val), and m.15326A > G (Thr > Ala) in the CYTB gene. We compared the variance at these mutated RNA residues phylogenetically across 16 different primate species, revealing this tRNAThr 15910C > T mutation to have a 100% conservation index across species, making it more likely to have functional significance when mutated as in this patient. Moreover, this mutation was also not detected when other 79 unrelated patients and 113 Chinese control subjects were analyzed.  Mutation leads to decreased mitochondrial tRNAThr levels We next assessed how this 15910C > T mutation altered the metabolism of tRNAThr, subjecting cybrid cell lines bearing this mitochondrial mutation to Northern blotting using probes specific to this and 3 other tRNAs. We found that tRNAThr levels in these mutant cybrid lines were significantly reduced relative to control wild type cells (Fig. 2), with baseline tRNAThr levels in these mutant cells being 65.25% of those in control cells, with 5S RNA used for normalization purposes. In contrast, baseline tRNAHis, tRNAAla, and tRNAGlu levels in these mutant cell lines were unchanged relative to control cells (102.13, 98.89, and 107.91%, respectively). Mutation leads to reduced mitochondrial protein levels We next performed Western blotting to assess levels of the mtDNA-encoded components of the respiratory complex in cells bearing the 15910C > T mutation or controls. As shown in Fig. 3, e found that mutant cells expressed mitochondrial protein levels that were 19.31 to 31.55% of those in control cells (average was 24.96%; P < 0.05). These mutated cells also showed clear reductions (18.71, 26.56, 37.52, 33.00 and 39.48%) in 5 polypeptides (ND4, ND1, ND6, CYTB and ATP6), while CO2 levels were not significantly reduced (0.15%) relative to control cells.  Mutation led to decreased complex I and III activity We further assessed the consequences of this m.15910C > T mutation on oxidative phosphorylation using isolated mitochondrial from our mutant and control cybrid cell lines. We found that complex I and III activity in the 15910C > T mutant mitochondria was 66.72, and 75.48% that of the activity observed in control cells, whereas no changes in complex II/IV activity were observed(Fig. 4a).  Mutation leads to reduced mitochondrial ATP generation We further assessed the generation of ATP by wild type and mutant cells in an effort to better gauge how this mutation influenced oxidative phosphorylation. To test this, either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation were selectively induced in cells via culture with glucose, glucose + oligomycin, or 2deoxy-D-glucose + pyruvate. When cells could only engage in oxidative phosphorylation, mutant cells bearing the 15910C > T mutation,exhibited ATP production that was 65.68–67.98% (average: 67.37%) of that in control cells(Fig. 4b). Mutation leads to increased ROS production We next assessed ROS production in our mutant cybrid cell lines via flow cytometry, comparing baseline staining intensity for each cell line to that upon oxidative stress in order to obtain a ratio corresponding to ROS generation. We observed somewhat increased ROS generation for our mutant cybrid cell lines bearing the 15910C > T mutation, with ROS production 118.45–123.98%, (average: 121.04%) that of control cells (Fig. 4c).",1066
27260124,"Background Coffee is an increasingly popular beverage worldwide, and coffee intake has been reported to have beneficial effects on health. Recently, Saab et al. published a systematic review of studies on the effects of coffee consumption on liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and hepatocellular carcinoma. They recommend daily coffee consumption to patients with chronic liver disease. Their systematic review also summarized epidemiological surveys reporting the inverse association between coffee consumption and elevated levels of serum liver enzymes, namely serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Mitochondrial DNA 5178 cytosine/adenine (Mt5178 C/A) polymorphism (rs28357984), also known as NADH dehydrogenase subunit-2 237 leucine/methionine (ND2-237 Leu/Met) polymorphism, is associated with longevity in the Japanese population. The frequency of the Mt5178A genotype is significantly higher in Japanese centenarians than in the general population. Japanese individuals with Mt5178A are more resistant to lifestyle-related adult onset diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disorders, than those with Mt5178C. Mt5178 C/A polymorphism influences the effects of coffee consumption on the risk of hypertension, those of abnormal glucose tolerance, those of hyper-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterolemia, and those of anemia. Moreover, this polymorphism modulates the effects of cigarette smoking on elevated levels of serum liver enzymes. However, there has been no research on the gene-environment interactions between Mt5178 C/A polymorphism and coffee consumption on elevated levels of serum liver enzymes. The objective of this study is to investigate whether there is a combined effect of longevity-associated Mt5178 C/A polymorphism and coffee consumption on abnormally elevated levels of serum liver enzymes in male Japanese health check-up examinees. Results Except for the AST/ALT ratio, no significant differences in clinical characteristics were observed between the Mt5178C and Mt5178A genotypes (Table 1). The AST/ALT ratio was significantly higher in subjects with Mt5178C than in those with Mt5178A (P = 0.004). Although the difference did not reach significance (P = 0.089), the frequency of subjects under antihypertensive treatment was higher in Mt5178C genotypic men than in Mt5178A genotypic men.  For subjects with Mt5178C, elevated levels of serum AST may depend on coffee consumption (P for trend = 0.026) (Table 2). The OR for elevated levels of serum AST was significantly lower in subjects with Mt5178C who consumed ≥3 cups of coffee per day than in those who consumed <1 cup per day (OR = 0.366, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.142–0.942, P = 0.037). After adjustment for age, BMI, alcohol consumption, habitual smoking, antihypertensive treatment, and antidiabetic treatment, elevated levels of serum AST may also depend on coffee consumption (P for trend = 0.013). The OR for elevated levels of serum AST was significantly lower in subjects with Mt5178C who consumed ≥3 cups of coffee per day than in those who consumed <1 cup per day (OR = 0.242, 95 % CI 0.081–0.730, P = 0.012). On the other hand, the association between Mt5178A genotype and elevated levels of serum AST does not appear to depend on coffee consumption.  In the case of elevated serum ALT levels, as defined as >30 U/L, for either Mt5178 C/A genotypes, no significant relationship between coffee consumption and elevated levels of serum ALT was observed (Table 3). However, in the case of elevated serum ALT levels, as defined as ≥25 U/L, for subjects with Mt5178C, elevated levels of serum ALT may depend on coffee consumption (P for trend = 0.015). The OR for elevated levels of serum ALT was significantly lower in subjects with Mt5178C who consumed ≥3 cups of coffee per day than in those who consumed <1 cup per day (OR = 0.409, 95 % CI 0.202–0.828, P = 0.013). After adjustment for age, BMI, alcohol consumption, habitual smoking, antihypertensive treatment, and antidiabetic treatment, elevated levels of serum ALT may also depend on coffee consumption (P for trend <0.001). The OR for elevated levels of serum ALT was significantly lower in subjects with Mt5178C who consumed ≥3 cups of coffee per day than in those who consumed <1 cup per day (OR = 0.198, 95 % CI 0.077–1.129, P < 0.001). On the other hand, the association between Mt5178A genotype and elevated levels of serum ALT does not appear to depend on coffee consumption.  In the case of elevated levels of serum GGT, as defined as ≥60 or >51 U/L, for subjects with Mt5178C, elevated levels of serum GGT may depend on coffee consumption (P for trend = 0.049 and P for trend = 0.015, respectively) (Table 4). The OR for elevated levels of serum GGT, as defined as ≥60 or >51 U/L, was significantly lower in subjects with Mt5178C who consumed ≥3 cups of coffee per day than in those who consumed <1 cup per day (OR = 0.488, 95 % CI 0.240–0.993, P = 0.048 and OR = 0.418, 95 % CI 0.209–0.837, P = 0.014, respectively). After adjusting for age, BMI, alcohol consumption, habitual smoking, antihypertensive treatment, and antidiabetic treatment, elevated levels of serum GGT, as defined as ≥60 or >51 U/L, may also depend on coffee consumption (P for trend = 0.002 and P for trend <0.001, respectively). After the aforementioned adjustment, the OR for elevated levels of serum GGT, as defined as ≥60 or >51 U/L, was significantly lower in subjects with Mt5178C who consumed ≥3 cups of coffee per day than in those who consumed <1 cup per day (OR = 0.313, 95 % CI 0.110–0.640, P = 0.003 and OR = 0.231, 95 % CI 0.095–0.561, P = 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, the association between Mt5178A genotype and elevated levels of serum GGT does not appear to depend on coffee consumption. ",878
23300652,"Introduction Mitochondria provide most of the energy in a cell by a process called oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), where carbohydrates and fats are oxidized by oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Although the majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA and imported into the mitochondria, these multi-functional organelles also contain their own DNA (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA). Twenty-four genes of the mtDNA code for components of the mitochondrial translational machinery (2 ribosomal RNAs and 22 transfer RNAs) and 13 genes provide essential subunits of the energy-generating enzymes of the OXPHOS pathway, namely complex I, III, IV and V. Only succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) is completely composed of nuclear encoded subunits. Mitochondrial function declines with age, and both mtDNA alterations and oxidative damage accumulate. Oxidative damage is produced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and most of the cellular ROS, such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, are generated in mitochondria from single electrons escaping the mitochondrial respiratory chain and reducing molecular oxygen. An electron leak is produced either when OXPHOS is inhibited and electron transfer is defective or when an overload of nutritional intake in combination with tightly coupled mitochondria causes electrons to accumulate. During evolution, the human population accumulated a high number of mtDNA base substitutions along radiating maternal lineages, where specific combinations of polymorphisms constitute what are referred to as mitochondrial haplogroups. Researchers have used and continue to use these population-specific polymorphisms to elucidate long-ago human migrations and human pre-history. It is believed that mtDNA variants and mitochondrial haplogroups differ in their OXPHOS performance, energy consumption and heat production, differences which may have allowed humans to adapt to climatic and nutritional changes. However, mitochondrial haplogroups have also been shown to be associated with multifactorial diseases. In our laboratory, mitochondrial haplogroup T was found to be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetic retinopathy. Haplogroup Twas also found to correlate with reduced spermatozoa motility, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to be negatively associated with the status of elite endurance athletes. A study by Baudouin et al. revealed that individuals with haplogroup H have a two-fold increased chance of survival after sepsis compared to individuals with other haplogroups. Haplogroup H was also discovered to be significantly more abundant in individuals with normal sperm motility, in healthy subjects compared to patients with CAD, and in healthy subjects compared to patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and to be associated with a reduced prevalence of age-related maculopathy. However, there are also studies showing that mitochondrial haplogroup H is associated with illness and haplogroup T is associated with protection. For instance, in epidemiological studies on Alzheimer’s disease (AD), haplogroup T was found to be underrepresented in AD, whereas haplogroup H or its subhaplogroup H5 were detected to be risk factors. Mitochondrial polymorphisms defining mitochondrial haplogroups or definite combinations of such polymorphisms could slightly alter OXPHOS coupling and performance as well as ROS production. To exclude the influence of a nucleus–mtDNA genetic interaction, an excellent in vitro system to study functional differences of mtDNA variations is the use of cybrids. Transmitochondrial cybrids are produced by fusion of cells depleted of their mtDNA (ρ0 cells) with cells devoid of nuclear DNA (e.g. thrombocytes). This technique is very useful to discriminate the functional consequences of mtDNA variations from the nuclear background. Cybrids have already been successfully used to distinguish the consequences of mtDNA mutations and polymorphisms, and also to find dissimilarity between mitochondrial haplogroups. Our aim was to elucidate functional differences between the European mitochondrial haplogroups H and T. The activity of mitochondrial OXPHOS enzymes, mtDNA copy number, proliferation capacity as well as susceptibility to oxidative stress were compared between haplogroup H- and T-specific cybrids. Results Based on our previous observation that patients with mitochondrial haplogroup T have a higher risk of developing CAD, and because haplogroup H is the most frequent haplogroup in Europe, we decided to compare cybrid cells of haplogroups H and T in terms of their mitochondrial functions. Cybrids were produced by fusion of HEK293 ρ0 cells with thrombocytes of three healthy individuals with mitochondrial haplogroup H (HEK H cybrids) and with thrombocytes of three patients with CAD with mitochondrial haplogroup T (HEK T cybrids). MtDNA Sequence Variation of Cybrids Whole mtDNA sequencing of cybrids was performed and individual polymorphisms (compared to the Cambridge Reference Sequence) were used to construct a phylogenetic tree of sub-haplogroups, according to phylotree.org. HEK H cybrids were classified into the sub-haplogroups H5b, H6a1a and H10b and HEK T cybrids were classified into the sub-haplogroups T1a1, T2a1b1 and T2b3 (Figure 1). Comparison of the mtDNA sequences to the Cambridge Reference Sequence revealed eight non-haplogroup-defining polymorphisms, which were present in all cybrids (m.263A>G; m.309-m.310insC or m.309-m.310insCC; m.315insC; m.750A>G; m.1438A>G; m.4769A>G; m.8860A>G; m.15326A>G). Non-haplogroup-defining polymorphisms not present in all cybrids are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Most differences between haplogroup specific cybrids concern noncoding regions of the mtDNA. Seven polymorphisms were detected in D-Loop Regions. m.16519T>C and m.152T>C are very common polymorphisms, with frequencies of 59.7% and 21.2% in the population (www.genpat.uu.se/mtDB/,) and found in four out of six and three out of six cybrids, respectively. The D-Loop polymorphisms m.151C>T, m.16184C>T, m.16344C>T are also common, at a frequency of at least one percent in the population (www.genpat.uu.se/mtDB/,). Only two of the D-Loop polymorphism (m.573-m.574insC, m.16280A>G) have not been described in the Human Mitochondrial Genome Database. The insertion of cysteins in a poly-C stretch between position 568 and 573 (m.573-m.574insC, cybrid T2) is described to occur in 27 sub-haplogroups and position m.16280A>G (cybrid T3) has nine citations in Mitomap (www.mitomap.org,), without reported association to disease. The gain of one cystein at 5895–5899, in the short non-coding region between the tRNA tyrosine and MT-CO1 genes, detected in cybrid H1, was described in one subject with progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Four sequence variations were found in mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes. In the 16s rRNA, the heteroplasmic position m.2170G>A with 48% substitution rate, as well as the base substitutions m.2412A>G and m.1760G>A, have not been reported previously. Position m.1598G>A in the 12 s rRNA, found in cybrid T2, is occurring with a frequency of 2.5% in the Human Mitochondrial Genome Database. Position m.12696T>C (0.3%,) detected in cybrid T1, affects complex I subunit ND5, but is a synonymous mutation. It is described to be a haplogroup-defining polymorphism in sub-haplogroups L0d1a1, M33a1b, HV1b, H56b and U5b2b1a2. Only two polymorphisms in cybrids H2 and one in T2 lead to differences in the amino acid compositions. The amino-acid change at position m.14324T>C in the MT-ND6 gene found in cybrid T2 has already been described, however not as a disease associated mutation but to occur in haplogroup C1e. The relevant amino acid p.Asn117 is not conserved across vertebrates. The two heteroplasmic variants found in cybrid H2, m.6996A>C (approximately 50% heteroplasmy) in the MT-CO1 gene and m.15246G>A (approximately 25% heteroplasmy) affect conserved amino acids in the MT-CYB gene and have not been reported previously. Normalized Activities of OXPHOS Enzymes do not Differ between H and T Because mtDNA encodes subunits of the OXPHOS system, variations of mtDNA could primarily affect the activity of OXPHOS enzymes. We determined possible functional differences between mitochondrial haplogroup H and T in HEK293 cybrids by measuring the enzymatic activities of OXPHOS enzymes and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme citrate syntase (CS) as a reference. There were no significant differences between HEK H and T cybrids in the enzymatic activities of CS or of OXPHOS complexes (Table 1). MtDNA Copy Number is Higher in Haplogroup T Cybrids Because mtDNA copy number is a reliable indicator of OXPHOS activity, we further analyzed mtDNA copy number in haplogroup-specific cybrid cells. Due to the fact that the inter-assay variation associated with the determination of mtDNA copy number is lower than the variation associated with the determination of OXPHOS enzyme activities, we hypothezised that true variation in mtDNA copy number has a better chance to impart subtle but significant differences among haplogroup-specific cybrids. For determination of mtDNA copy number, the cells were cultivated in glucose or galactose medium. High concentrations of glucose in the cultivation medium frequently leads to inhibition of respiration (crabtree effect). Cultivation of cells in non-glucose containing galactose medium hence might increase respiration, and haplogroup dependent OXPHOS differences may be more prominent. As expected, cultivation of cells in galactose medium resulted in a significantly higher mtDNA copy number compared to cells cultivated in medium supplemented with glucose (Figure 2A). We detected a higher mtDNA copy number in HEK T cybrids compared to HEK H cybrids, with the difference being more pronounced in cybrids cultivated in galactose medium (Figures 2B and C). However, these differences were statistically not significant. Haplogroup T Cybrids have a Higher Growth Rate The proliferation capacity of cells mirrors their energy-producing capacity. Hence, we next investigated the proliferation rate of HEK H and T cybrid cells by two different methods. Growth curves Growth curves were determined by measuring the number of HEK H and HEK T cybrid cells using a CyQUANT® NF Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. The mean growth rate of the cybrid cells was higher on days three to seven for HEK T compared to HEK H cybrids when cultivated in glucose medium, and significant p-values were obtained on days three and four (Figure 3A). In galactose medium, the growth of HEK H and HEK T cybrids did not differ significantly (Figure 3B). Competitive mix experiments A more sensitive method of comparing the growth capability of different cells is a competitive mix experiment. The prolonged cultivation time and direct competition of cybrids within the same culture flask allows a direct comparison of growth rates. Each HEK H cybrid clone was co-cultivated with each HEK T cybrid clone at a 1∶1 mixture of cells. After 10, 20 and 30 days of co-culture, DNA was isolated and the proportion of each genotype was analyzed using TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) with probes specific for haplogroup H (7028C) or all other haplogroups (7028T, in our case indicative for haplogroup T). After 10, 20 and 30 days in glucose medium, a trend toward haplogroup T as the dominant genotype was observed (Figure 4A), whereas in galactose medium a trend toward dominance of haplogroup H was observed (Figure 4B). Mitochondrial Haplogroup T is Less Susceptible to Oxidative Stress Subtle differences between haplogroup-specific cybrids might only become apparent under stress conditions. Therefore, we challenged the cybrids with different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and measured susceptibility to ROS by determination of cell viability. Cells grown in galactose medium were more sensitive to H2O2 treatment than cells grown in glucose medium (Figure 5). Cell survival of HEK T cybrids was higher than that of HEK H cybrids. Statistically significant differences were found at all four concentrations of H2O2 in glucose medium as well as in the two highest concentrations (200 µM, 250 µM) of H2O2 in galactose medium (Figure 5A and B).",1813
16620376,"Background The human mitochondrial genome is a circular double stranded DNA of 16.6 kb encoding 13 respiratory chain protein subunits, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs. The mitochondrial mRNA contains no introns. There is a 1.2-kb hypervariable non-coding D-loop region that is susceptible to somatic DNA mutations. Each cell contains hundreds to thousands of mitochondria, and each mitochondrion contains 2–10 copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The major function of mitochondria is to produce energy to support cellular activities through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. During this process reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated. Due to the lack of protective histone proteins and the close vicinity, mtDNA is an easy target for oxidative DNA damage by ROS. In addition, the limited DNA repair mechanism allows mtDNA mutations to accumulate. Thus, the mutation rate of mtDNA is at least 10 times higher than that of nuclear DNA. The roles of mitochondria in energy metabolism, the generation of ROS, aging, and the initiation of apoptosis have implicated their importance in tumorigenesis. Neoplastic transformation is a multi-step process in that alterations in multiple nuclear genes have been extensively documented. Somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) changes during tumorigenesis have also been recognized in recent years. However, unlike the common mtDNA mutations in maternally inherited mitochondrial disease, the functional significance and pathogenic mechanism of somatic mtDNA mutations in cancer development remains unclear despite the vast evidence of their occurrence in various types of tumors. The identification of tumor suppressing functions of several genes that are involved in energy metabolism and the role of the mitochondria in apoptotic pathways, have suggested that mtDNA alterations might be an important integral of tumorigenesis and programmed cell death. Evidences of down-regulation of bioenergetic function of mitochondria have been documented. Extensive analysis of the mitochondrial genome using direct sequencing has revealed that approximately 30–70% of all types of tumors harbor mtDNA alterations. A majority of these studies focused on the analysis of hypervariable, non-coding D-loop region. Comprehensive mutational analysis of the entire mitochondrial genome achieved by direct sequencing of approximately 80% of the mitochondrial genome or by the use of TTGE mutation screening method with overlapping primers covering the entire genome was limited to only a few studies. Previous reports demonstrated that most of the somatic mtDNA mutations found in cancer were in the homoplasmic form. This observation led to the conclusion that mutant mitochondria gained a replicative advantage during tumorigenesis and became homoplasmic within a few generations. Our recent investigation of somatic mtDNA mutations in breast, oral, and brain tumors revealed that mutations in the coding region did occur and there were significant number of heteroplasmic alterations. Esophageal cancer is one of the most common and aggressive cancers in Central and Southeast China, including Taiwan. A high incidence rate of >1.25 per 1,000 and a cumulative mortality rate of 20–25% have been reported. Somatic mtDNA mutations in the non-coding D-loop region occurred in 5 and 34% of primary esophageal tumors reported by two Japanese studies. A similar investigation of Chinese patients from Shanxi province also reported D-loop mtDNA mutations in 33% of esophageal tumors. These studies were limited to the non-coding hypervariable region only. Results from others and our studies of various types of cancers suggest that the somatic mtDNA mutation spectrum may vary among different tissues. Furthermore, unlike the mutations in the non-coding region, novel missense and frameshift mutations in coding region may have pathogenic significance. In addition, changes in mtDNA content in tumors may have clinicopathological implication in tumorigenesis. In this report, we use TTGE mutation scanning method to study somatic mtDNA mutations in the entire mitochondrial genome of 20 esophageal tumors and their surrounding tissue. We also evaluated the mtDNA content in the tumor and its surrounding tissue and correlated the molecular findings with the clinicopathological profile of the tumor. Results Somatic mtDNA mutations in esophageal primary tumors To test if somatic mtDNA mutation is a general phenomenon in esophageal cancer and to characterize the mutation spectrum, the TTGE mutation detection method was used to screen the entire mitochondrial genome of tumor and surrounding normal tissues. Figure 1 depicts the four novel somatic mtDNA mutations. Panels A-C each showed single band to multiple band change from surrounding normal tissue to tumor tissue indicating a homoplasmy to heteroplasmy alteration, while panel D showed an alteration from a heteroplasmy to homoplasmy. Direct sequencing of the DNA fragment allowed the identification of the mutations as shown in Figure 1 and listed in Table 1. Eleven out of 20 (55%) tumors harbored somatic mtDNA mutations with a total of 14 mutations. Nine mutations were found in the D-loop region, one in 12S rRNA and four in mRNA. Eleven tumors were found to have somatic mutations (Table 1). All nine mutations in the D-loop involved an insertion or deletion within the poly C stretch of the nucleotide positions (np) 303–309 hot spot region. One of them, the T at nucleotide position 310 was changed to C, resulting a homopolycytidine stretch of 15 C's. The long stretch of poly C might increase the instability of this region. Two of the somatic mutations changed from the homoplasmic state in surrounding tissue to a mutant homoplasmic state in tumor. Three changed from heteroplasmic state in normal to homoplasmic state in tumor, and 6 changed from homoplasmic wild type to heteroplasmic mutant. Three had heteroplasmy in both the surrounding tissue and the tumor, but the proportions of the mutant mtDNA in the paired tissues are different. Germline sequence variations When the sequence of surrounding tissue was compared with revised Cambridge reference mtDNA sequence deposited in GenBank (accession No: NC_001807) and MitoMap , numerous germline sequence variations were found. A total of 185 distinct germline variations have been identified from the sequenced fragments. These do not represent all the sequence variations in the specimens analyzed since only the DNA regions that show somatic mutations, either homoplasmic or heteroplasmic, by TTGE were sequenced. Ten of these variations are novel (Table 2), and 175 (data not shown) of them have been recorded in the Mitomap database. Eight of these novel variations occurred in mRNA region, and five were missense variations (Table 2). Among them, the most remarkable is A11976C in NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) where tyrosine at amino acid position 406 is replaced by serine. Other novel missense variations are M47T in NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4L), S531T in NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5), S219N in ATP synthase subunit 6 (ATPase 6), and E109D in cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII). The reported polymorphisms are mostly unremarkable. Other frequent germ-line polymorphisms are C16233T, T16189C, T16519C in D-loop region, and C12705T in ND5, and T9540C in cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) are silent variations with no amino acid change. Significance of novel somatic and germline mutations The frameshift mutation, 10941del TAACAACCCCC, causing frame-shift and premature termination at amino acid 110 of ND4, is expected to be a deleterious mutation. It involves a homoplasmy to heteroplasmy change. G10500A somatic mutation changes a moderately conserved alanine residue to threonine in ND4L (Fig. 2A). The A9182G mutation in ATPase6 is a back change from asparagine to serine. The wildtype is serine, but it is asparagine in the patient's normal tissue and changes back to serine in the tumor. The amino acid is located in a moderately conserved region (Fig. 2B). One silent mutation G9377A in COIII (cytochrome c oxidase subunit III) does not change the amino acid. However, it does not exclude the possibility that the nucleotide substitution may cause impairment in RNA processing due to improper precursor RNA folding. Another mutation, A1544T in 12S rRNA occurs at a stem region. This mutation causes the disruption of a critical base pair. It may destabilize the rRNA structure. In addition to somatic mtDNA mutations, novel missense germline mutations may also cause affect on mitochondrial function. For instance, A11976C changes an evolutionary highly conserved hydrophobic tyrosine to hydrophilic serine at amino acid position 406 of ND4 subunit (Fig. 3A), would potentially cause functional effect. Another example is the E109D mutation in COII (Fig. 3B). Although it involves a conserved amino acid change, the shortening of hydrocarbon chain may have subtle effects on mitochondrial function. Accumulation of the subtle effect over time may increase an individual's risk of developing cancer. All five novel missense germline variations were not detected in 19 breast cancers, 31 neurofibromas, and 15 medulloblastomas, all of Caucasian origin in previous studies. They were also not present in 18 oral cancers and 20 liver cancers of Taiwanese patients. Molecular and clinicopathological characteristics To investigate if the down-regulation of mitochondrial function in cancers is due to regression of mtDNA biogenesis, the relative amount of mtDNA in tumor compared to that in the surrounding non-cancerous tissue was measured by real-time quantitative PCR analysis. Table 3 lists the results and clinicopathological characteristics of each tumor. The mean value of tumor/normal mtDNA ratio in the tumors with mtDNA mutation was 1.32 ± 0.31 and that of the tumors without mtDNA mutation was 1.45 ± 0.22. Thus, tumor with or without somatic mtDNA mutations show no significant difference (p value = 0.59 using non-parametric Mann-Whitney test) in mtDNA content change from normal to tumors. The majority (6 out of 11) of tumors with somatic mtDNA mutations have either elevated (>2) or reduced (<0.5) mtDNA content in tumors compared to surrounding normal tissue. However the p value (0.27) does not reach a statistically significant level as analyzed by Fisher's exact test. Analysis of a larger sample size will be required. The patient (case E18) whose mtDNA content is severely reduced in tumor harbored a frameshift deleterious mutation (10941 del 11bp). He was also the youngest patient (38 years of age). His tumor was at stage III and metastasized to lymph nodes. He expired 12 months after surgery. The patient (case E18) had a previous history of tongue cancer. The patient (case E05) who had the most reduced mtDNA content in tumor, harbored the A1544T novel mutation in 12S rRNA gene. His tumor was at stage III and had metastasized. He expired 4 months after the surgery. These two cases are consistent with the possibility that mtDNA mutations are associated with impaired biogenesis of mitochondrial genome. Four tumors had more than 2 fold increase in mtDNA content. Two of them (case E10 and E17) had 303–309 hot spot poly C mutation. Both patients had metastatic tumors, and died post-surgery. Two other patients had small non-metastatic tumors. The relationship of the mtDNA content changes in tumor with tumor size, and metastatic status is depicted in figure 4. The majority of tumors display an inverse relationship between tumor size and mtDNA content change (Fig. 4). Eight out of 11 tumors with mtDNA mutations became metastatic, whereas only 4 out of 9 tumors without somatic mtDNA mutations became metastatic. The analysis of odds ratio showed that the patients with somatic mtDNA mutation has 3.33 times higher risk of metastasis compared to patients without somatic mutations. However, due to a small sample size, it does not reach the statistic significant level (odds ratio: 3.33, 95% CI: 0.515–21.6). In order to reach statistical significance, the study of a larger sample size will be necessary.",1858
31479473,"Introduction Mitochondrial disease is highly heterogeneous in etiology, with more than 350 causal genes across both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorders can include point mutations, as well as single or multiple large-scale mtDNA deletions and duplications. Whereas multiple large mtDNA deletions are widely recognized to result from pathogenic variants involving a wide array of possible nuclear gene disorders, single large-scale mtDNA deletions (SLSMDs) have long been thought to occur sporadically in affected individuals or oocytes, since they were first discovered to cause human disease 30 years ago. Furthermore, SLSMDs have classically been thought to manifest as one of several discrete clinical syndromes that present in different individuals at specific ages. These classical clinical syndromes include: (1) Pearson syndrome, which presents with infantile sideroblastic anemia and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; (2) Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), which generally presents in the second decade with progressive multi-system disease including retinal dystrophy, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and a range of other possible features including ptosis, cerebellar ataxia, intellectual disability, dementia, sensorineural hearing loss, cardiac conduction block with sudden death, gastrointestinal dysmotility, endocrinopathies, muscle weakness, and exercise intolerance; and (3) Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), which manifests in adults with eye movement paralysis (ophthalmoplegia), ptosis, oropharyngeal weakness, and proximal myopathy with exercise intolerance. Leigh syndrome involving progressive subacute necrotizing encephalomyopathy, regression with illness, and a range of neurologic disabilities has also been seen in those with a SLSMD, although it manifests less frequently. Further, it is increasingly recognized that individuals with SLSMDs may present with a range of manifestations that cross classical syndrome boundaries. When SLSMDs are identified, they are typically thought to provide a definitive clinical diagnosis, with no need to pursue further diagnostic evaluation to discern their etiology. mtDNA is replicated by a core collection of proteins that includes the DNA polymerase gamma (composed of the POLG catalytic subunit and POLG2 accessory subunit), the Twinkle helicase, and the single stranded DNA binding protein (SSBP1) (Fig 1). Defects in POLG, POLG2, and TWNK are frequent causes of inherited forms of mitochondrial disease that include recessive and dominant forms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), ataxia-neuropathy syndromes, childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum disorders, and Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. Multiple mtDNA deletions or mtDNA depletion are commonly identified in these nuclear gene disorders that impair mtDNA replication. Single stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) bind and protect single stranded DNA (ssDNA) with very high selectivity and affinity during DNA replication. Without SSB, ssDNA would be vulnerable to attack by chemical damage, nucleases, and DNA binding by inappropriate proteins. SSBs also help prevent secondary structure formation in ssDNA regions. In mitochondria, given the heavy concentration of 22 tRNA genes in mtDNA, secondary structure can represent a road-block during replication of the displaced single-stranded heavy strand initiated from the light strand origin of replication (OriL). Mitochondrial SSB was initially identified in X. laevis oocytes, with subsequent cloning of Xenopus, rat, and human SSB, all of which show high homology with E. coli SSB. Deletion of the yeast mitochondrial SSB (RIM1) causes loss of viability on non-fermentable carbon sources and loss of mtDNA. Knock-down of SSBP1 expression in human cells causes loss of mtDNA and severely reduced synthesis of the 7S DNA. A 2.4 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of human mitochondrial SSBP1 in the absence of mtDNA reveals a tightly interacting tetramer formed by two dimers. Although no structure of SSBP1 with mtDNA has been determined, we have observed ssDNA wrapping once around the tetramer by using atomic force microscopy. Recently, two studies have reported pathogenic variants of SSBP1. The c.3G>A variant, which abolishes the SSBP1 start codon, co-segregates in one family with the m.1555A>G mtDNA variant underlying maternally inherited deafness. Three missense variants, c.113G>A (p.R38Q), c.320G>A (p.R107Q), and c.422G>A (p.S141N), were reported in two families and two singletons with autosomal dominant optic atrophy and varying levels of retinal degeneration. Here, we report a now 14-year-old Chinese boy who presented to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Mitochondrial Medicine Frontier Program for clinical evaluation of lifelong, severe, progressive, multi-system disease. Indeed, he had progressive clinical manifestations across the full Pearson, Kearns-Sayre, and Leigh syndromes spectrum. mtDNA genome sequencing by next generation sequencing in his blood identified a SLSMD, a novel 5,440 base pair deletion (m.8629_14068del5440), which was subsequently determined by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to be present at 68% and 16% heteroplasmy in the proband’s fibroblast cell line and blood, respectively. Muscle biopsy was refused by the family due to risk of anesthesia. Given the complexity of his disease, whole exome trio sequencing in blood was performed to exclude an additional nuclear gene disorder, which demonstrated the proband had a novel de novo heterozygous variant c.79G>A (p.E27K) in SSBP1. Detailed in silico modeling and functional biochemical validation of p.E27K SSBP1 were performed to determine whether the mutation disrupts SSBP1 tetramerization, thermostability, molecular dynamics, and mtDNA binding capacity. Results SSBP1 de novo dominant mutation identified in proband with SLSMD and complex mitochondrial disease phenotype A Chinese boy, presently 14 years old, was referred to the CHOP Mitochondrial Medicine Frontier Program for diagnostic evaluation at 11 years of age for progressive multi-system involvement suspected to be primary mitochondrial disease. While the mother had a normal pregnancy and the child showed normal early development except for delayed speech, he developed infantile-onset transfusion-dependent anemia and bone marrow failure, growth failure with frank growth hormone deficiency, and failure to thrive. He later developed progressive ataxia, ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia, followed by severe rod-cone dystrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, chronic kidney disease, cardiac conduction block, multiple endocrine deficiencies, and progressive neurologic decline including metabolic strokes consistent with Leigh syndrome (Fig 2). Laboratory testing revealed lactic acidemia (2.4–4.7 mM, normal <2 mM) as well as elevated CSF lactate (>2-fold increase) and CSF protein (>4-fold increase). Muscle biopsy was refused due to anesthesia concerns. Full clinical details are included in the supplement including full clinical history and laboratory testing results (S1 File), brain MRI images (S1 Fig), fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) image (S2 Fig), audiogram (S3 Fig), and growth parameters (S4 Fig). mtDNA genome sequencing by next generation sequencing in his blood on a clinical diagnostic basis at GeneDx identified a unique SLSMD, a 5,440 base pair deletion (m.8629_14068del5440) (Fig 3A). This mtDNA deletion was further confirmed by independent NGS analysis of the mtDNA genome at the CHOP Division of Genomic Diagnostics, with ddPCR analysis demonstrating this SLSMD was present at 68±3% and 16±5% heteroplasmy in the proband’s fibroblast cell line and blood, respectively. Given the severity and complexity of his disease manifestations, whole exome trio sequencing was performed to exclude additional nuclear gene disorders. mtDNA genome sequencing repeated by GeneDx at the time of exome sequencing again confirmed the presence in the proband of the same 5,440 base pair deletion (m.8629_14068del5440). Trio exome sequencing revealed the proband harbored a novel de novo heterozygous mutation c.79G>A in SSBP1 that was absent in both parents (Fig 3B). This mutation was not present in dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp), MSeqDR (https://mseqdr.org/), nor ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) databases for the human SSBP1 and results in a glutamate (E) to lysine (K) substitution at residue 27 of mitochondrial single stranded DNA binding protein (SSBP1). This mutation was also not found in over 4,500 healthy Chinese individuals from the Chinese Millionome Database (CMDB) at China National GeneBank, nor another 5,333 East Asians by WGS including the 3.5KJPNv2 whole-genome reference panel from 3,552 healthy Japanese individuals and the Northeast Asian Reference Database (NARD) derived from WGS data of 1,781 individuals from Koreans, Mongolians and other East Asians. Furthermore, no mutations were found in known nuclear genes involved in mtDNA maintenance including, but not limited to, POLG, POLG2, TWNK, RRM2B, DGUOK, TK2, SLC25A4, MPV17, MGME1, and others. While a muscle biopsy was not available for mtDNA copy number analysis, primary fibroblast cell line and lymphoblastoid cell lines from the proband and parents (as available) were analyzed for SSBP1 protein, oxidative phosphorylation capacity, and mtDNA copy number. As anticipated, no difference was observed in the level of SSBP1 protein between proband and father fibroblasts by Western blot analysis (S5A Fig). Mitochondrial respiratory capacity as measured by Oxygraph 2K (Oroboros) showed a 20% decrease in basal and maximal respiratory capacity of the proband as compared to fibroblasts from the father, and a 17% decrease in lymphoblastoid cells compared to the mother (S5B Fig). Coincident with this drop in mitochondrial respiratory capacity, a 50% decreased mtDNA copy number was observed in lymphoblastoid cells of the proband as compared to the mother using qPCR against mt-ND1 (not affected by the deletion) and mt-COXIII (affected by the deletion). In contrast to the lymphoblastoid cells, an increase was found in fibroblasts as compared to the father, probably as a compensatory increase (S5C Fig). SSBP1 E27 is conserved among higher eukaryotes and may participate in an inter-subunit salt bridge Multiple sequence alignment of the primary sequences of mitochondrial SSBs from several species reveals that E27 is invariant among higher eukaryotes (Fig 4A). SSBP1 forms a homotetramer, and E27 is found at monomer-monomer interfaces when mapped onto a tetramer modeled from the reported crystal structure of SSBP1 (PDB 3ULL) (Fig 4B). E27 resides at the edge of a positively-charged surface patch which may be involved in DNA binding. The patch also harbors two arginine (R) residues implicated in mitochondrial disease: heritable pathogenic missense variants of R38 or R107 to glutamine (Q) were recently reported. Importantly, E27 appears well-positioned to participate in an inter-subunit salt bridge with R38 in the neighboring subunit at each monomer-monomer interface (Fig 4B, inset), an interaction which may be structurally significant for the tetramer. Several testable hypotheses for a molecular mechanism of disease for E27K present themselves. First, the charge inversion from glutamate to lysine may break the putative inter-subunit salt bridge and destabilize the tetramer. Second, the loss of negatively-charged glutamate and addition of positively-charged lysine could strengthen DNA binding through the net increase of positive charge. Third, the replacement of glutamate with lysine might rearrange the adjacent positively-charged patch, altering DNA binding or protein stability. To investigate the biochemical consequences of the E27K charge inversion, we purified recombinant WT and p.E27K SSBP1 overproduced in E. coli. p.E27K SSBP1 remains a stable tetramer but is less thermostable than WT SSBP1 The simplest hypothesis for a molecular mechanism for disease is that the p.E27K variant breaks the SSBP1 tetramer. If this were the case, size exclusion chromatography would reveal multiple species of different sizes, representing tetramers, dimers, and monomers. However, size exclusion chromatography of WT SSBP1 showed a single symmetrical peak, consistent with the documented stability of SSBP1 as a tetramer (Fig 5A). p.E27K SSBP1 also eluted from this column in a single peak at the same elution volume, indicating that the E27K substitution does not destabilize the tetramer under these conditions (Fig 5A). Even with a stable tetramer, changes in the overall stability of p.E27K SSBP1 may point to a mechanism for disease. To test whether the overall thermostability of SSBP1, as a property of the protein, might be affected by the E27K substitution, both WT and p.E27K SSBP1 were subjected to differential scanning fluorimetry (Fig 5B). WT SSBP1 yielded a major melting temperature of 75.1°C, consistent with previous reports, while p.E27K SSBP1’s major melting temperature was shifted lower, to 71.1°C (Fig 5B, inset). Both proteins also showed a minor melting peak, observed for WT SSBP1 as a shoulder with a melting temperature of 61.6°C and for p.E27K SSBP1 as a small distinct peak with a melting temperature of 39.6°C (Fig 5B). These complex melt curves are unsurprising for tetrameric complexes, which pass through multiple stages during thermal denaturation. Further, both proteins are very stable at physiologically relevant temperatures. Intriguingly, the signal intensity for p.E27K SSBP1 was reproducibly low compared to that of WT SSBP1, regardless of salt or protein concentration, suggesting some fundamental difference in binding of the fluorescent dye employed in the assay. Overall, these data indicate small changes exist in the thermostability of p.E27K SSBP1 relative to WT SSBP1. E27K does not substantially weaken SSBP1 DNA binding, but may alter DNA binding behavior In the absence of a gross destabilizing effect of the p.E27K SSBP1, we next interrogated the biological function of SSBP1, ssDNA binding. Of the available methods for assessing DNA binding, fluorescence anisotropy has the advantage of permitting the observation of protein-DNA interactions in solution. This eliminates the potential for effects of the molecular environment encountered by the proteins and DNA during electrophoresis. Fluorescence anisotropy reflects the mobility of a fluorophore attached to the DNA substrate. An increase in anisotropy signals decreased mobility of the DNA substrate, indicative of a protein-bound state. Therefore, anisotropy should increase with protein concentration, reaching a final plateau at saturation of DNA-protein binding. An apparent Kd can be calculated from a quadratic fit of these data points. In the case of p.E27K SSBP1, three results were possible relative to WT: tighter binding (lower Kd), weaker binding (higher Kd), or no change in binding of ssDNA (the same Kd). When we measured fluorescence anisotropy of a FAM-labeled 50 nucleotide ssDNA substrate in the presence of increasing concentrations of SSBP1 tetramer, we determined an apparent Kd for WT SSBP1 of 2.3 nM (S.D. ± 0.82) (Fig 6). For p.E27K SSBP1, we determined an apparent Kd of 9.3 nM (S.D. ± 1.32). While there is a 4-fold difference between these apparent Kd values, they both reflect very tight binding and are consistent with no major defect in the affinity of p.E27K SSBP1 for ssDNA. Intriguingly, the maximum anisotropy values for p.E27K SSBP1 at its plateau are about 1.4-fold higher than those for WT. This indicates that at saturation, where every ssDNA is bound to SSBP1, the fluorophore on the ssDNA bound to p.E27K SSBP1 is less mobile than that associated with WT SSBP1. Control experiments confirmed that our 50 nucleotide ssDNA substrate binds only one tetramer of either WT or p.E27K SSBP1 (S6 Fig). Therefore, the simplest explanation for this observation is that the ssDNA end to which the fluorophore is attached may somehow be more tightly “tucked” against the protein in the case of p.E27K SSBP1 than in WT. In the absence of a crystal structure with DNA bound, any proposal about the nature of this “tucking” is purely speculative. Based on the collective biochemical data, no clear molecular mechanism for disease presents itself. With only modest differences in thermostability and DNA binding between WT and p.E27K SSBP1, it seems likely that a more elusive biological explanation exists. One tantalizing possibility is that the in vivo defect arises from the fact that the proband is heterozygous for the disease allele. This means that SSBP1 tetramers within the proband’s mitochondria would be a mixture of WT and p.E27K homotetramers, as well as an array of heterotetramers in various combinations. The biochemical studies presented have focused on the homotetramers, as the heterotetramers are biochemically impossible to reproduce. SSBP1 monomers are bound so tightly within each tetramer as to preclude disassembly of homotetramers and reassembly into heterotetramers in vitro. And while intricate purification strategies might make purification of heterotetramers possible, these heterotetramers would exist in mixtures of orientations of WT and p.E27K monomers within each tetramer, rendering experimental interpretation impossible. To circumvent this experimental obstacle, we turned to molecular modeling as a method for ascertaining differences between WT SSBP1 and variations of the tetramer with p.E27K SSBP1. In silico modeling of the WT and E27K SSBP1 confirms the stability of tetramers with various mutant monomer compositions Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have proven to be a useful tool in unearthing structure-function relationships in recent years, specifically in cases where mutations may alter structural and thermodynamic properties of proteins. In the present case, we can reliably use the existing structural information of mitochondrial SSBP1 available from the Protein Data Bank to predict solution structures of WT SSBP1 and to construct mutant solution structures to study changes in mutant proteins. Several solution structures were estimated for various selected systems including the WT tetramer (WT-abcd, where “a, b, c, and d” are the monomer identities used in the text hereafter), and five tetramer conformations with the E27K mutation introduced in only monomer a, monomers a and b, monomers a and c, monomers a, b, and c, and all monomers. First, we confirmed the stability of mutant tetramer structures through the root mean square deviations (RMSD) from our MD trajectories via the observation of the convergence of RMSD values during the last 100 ns of simulations (S7 Fig). We have noted that the two monomers reported in the X-ray crystal structure of human SSBP1 showed a RMSD value of 1.8 Å for their backbone conformations, and a segment of residues in the middle of each peptide was found to be disordered. All of our solution structures converged to yield RMSDs in the range of 3–4.5Å. This convergence indicates stable tetramers for WT and p.E27K SSBP1 in solution, consistent with our experimental size exclusion results. Observed RMSD values for structures of proteins of this size are generally smaller than those for both the crystal and solution structures of SSBP1. This suggests that SSBP1 is more dynamic in solution than other proteins of comparable size. This dynamic nature may potentially be required by the function of SSBP1 since ssDNA needs to be loaded preferentially and with high affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal constrained mobility in p.E27K SSBP1 tetramer Representative structures created using snapshots taken from the latter part of the MD trajectory of each system are shown in Fig 7. In all systems studied, the inner β-barrelBARREL scaffold is preserved and, as it does in the WT, seems to provide the necessary stability at the tetramer interface (Fig 7). The inter-monomer interaction free energy (S1 Table) predicts possible variations in the strength of inter-monomer interactions. Large shifts in free energy among various monomers are observed when some or all monomers contained mutated E27K, and certain combinations show strengthened interactions between some monomers without weakening of other interactions. This may be viewed as a gain of strength in tetramer formation in the presence of one or more mutant monomers. In contrast to this observation, mobility for all models is much more apparent in outer loops that may be in contact with ssDNA. This mobility can be visualized with heat maps representing the averaged deviations in alpha carbon (Cα) distances (Fig 7). Such Cα deviation maps convey the positional fluctuations of each amino acid residue at its base with respect to any other residue’s Cα, producing a summary of amino acid residue movements within a protein. In this case, Cα deviations were evaluated by averaging Cα distances of the tetramer configurations from the final 100 ns of each simulation and subtracting the initial Cα distances, to reflect only changes in Cα distances over the simulation. All systems exhibit combinations of stable (red) and dynamic (yellow or black) peptide regions; in short, these maps indicate a high degree of mobility. Regions with smaller deviations (red) are mostly the residues providing the stability in the fold of each monomer and in tetramer interactions. Solvent-exposed residues, loops, and β-hairpins in each monomer experiences larger deviations (yellow or black). This is further supported by the root mean square fluctuations of each residue calculated through normalized B-factors (S8 Fig). Large fluctuations are observed in the N-terminus and in all three β-hairpin loop regions (bracketed by residues 46–53, 67–81, 119–126). These data suggest that several regions have relatively large fluctuations, irrespective of the tetramer system, and individual monomers show variable degrees of fluctuation when homologous segments are compared. This also indicates that the symmetry shown in the X-ray crystal structures doesn’t hold for peptides in the outer loops. To further quantify these data, we calculated the percentage of residue pairs fluctuating within a given distance as a semi-quantitative measure of the mobility of each tetrameter system. Intra-monomer fluctuations reveal an important difference between residue mobility in WT and p.E27K monomers. In WT monomers, 71% of intra-monomer deviations are within 2 Å or less for each monomer in the tetramer. Interestingly, this number increases to 77% for monomers in the averaged mutant systems. The fact that only 23% of residue pairs in the mutant systems have larger than 2 Å deviations, as opposed to 29% of pairs in the WT, supports the interpretation that mobility of the mutant tetramers is constrained. When overall (intra- and inter-monomer) fluctuations are taken into consideration, similar differences are observed for WT (61%) and the mutants (69%), representing a 7% decrease in the deviations larger than 2 Å in the mutant systems. Net positive charges reflected in solvent accessible surface areas are significantly different in WT and p.E27K tetramer solution structures Our estimated solution structures also allow us to address the effect of the additional charge that is introduced by the E to K substitution. Whenever an E residue is mutated to a K, each monomer peptide increases its net electronic charge by +2e. This introduces +2e, +4e, +6e, and +8e additional charges on tetramer assemblies when one, two, three, and all four monomers are mutated, respectively. In the WT SSBP1 tetramer, there exists a net +16e charge due to the counter balancing of 68 positively-charged K and R residues by 52 negatively charged E and aspartate (D) residues. To study how this net positive charge is distributed on the molecular surface, we constructed electrostatic potential (ESP) maps for each system using the partial atomic charges available from the same force field used in MD trajectory calculations. Such ESPs serve as reasonable estimates for the interacting surface presented to negatively charged ssDNA. The ESP surfaces calculated on representative conformations are displayed in S9 Fig, and positively-charged (blue) patches that are potentially used in recruiting ssDNA segments can be readily observed on these surfaces. Additionally, a quantification of the charge distribution in a global sense is presented in Table 1. A slight reduction in total surface area is observed for the mutant systems. Unexpectedly, a reduction in the positively-charged area relative to WT is observed for tetramer systems with two or fewer mutant monomers, while this area is increased in the other two systems (tetramers with three or four mutant monomers). A significant reduction in overall positively-charged surface area is observed for the system with a single monomer mutant. In contrast, a substantial increase in the area with a net positive surface charge is observed when three or more monomers in the tetramer are mutants. Such variations in the area with a net positive charge might have a significant effect on DNA binding in vivo, where a mixture of tetramers would be available to bind mtDNA and variability from tetramer to tetramer could impact overall protection of ssDNA during replication.",3768

23001348,"Over 70 years ago Otto Warburg observed that cancer cells produce excessive lactate in the presence of oxygen, a state he termed ‘aerobic glycolysis’. Today, this high rate of glucose uptake by solid tumours is used as a diagnostic through 18F-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation detected by positron emission tomography. During the twentieth century considerable effort was expended to determine whether aerobic glycolysis was due to defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), with generally negative results. However, this failure was more a reflection of a lack of fundamental knowledge about mitochondrial biology than a lack of relevance of mitochondria to cancer. The mitochondrial bacterium is the 2 billion year symbiotic partner of the nuclear–cytosolic organism. Today, the mitochondrial genome encompasses between one and two thousand nuclear DNA (nDNA) genes plus thousands of copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that reside within the mitochondrion. The mtDNA retains the 13 most important OXPHOS genes, while the nDNA contains all of the remaining OXPHOS genes, as well as the genes for mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis (FIGS 1,2). The mitochondrion is a highly evolved system for coordinating energy production and distribution based on the availability of calories and oxygen and the demands for cellular maintenance and reproduction. In many cancer cells, bioenergetic reprogramming involves switching from the maximal ATP production by OXPHOS in quiescent, differentiated cells to the requirement for balancing energy needs with substrate generation for cellular biogenesis and reproduction in rapidly growing cells. Many vital cellular parameters are controlled by mitochondria. These include regulation of energy production, modulation of oxidation–reduction (redox) status, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), control of cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) levels, contribution to cytosolic biosynthetic precursors such as acetyl-CoA and pyrimidines, and initiation of apoptosis through the activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) (FIG. 3). Changes in these parameters can impinge on biosynthetic pathways, cellular signal transduction pathways, transcription factors and chromatin structure to shift the cell from a quiescent, differentiated state to an actively proliferating one. Although mutations in the mtDNA in cancer cells have been recognized for more than two decades, interest in the role of mitochondrial alterations in cancer came to general attention with the discovery of mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle gene mutations in cancer cells. Cancer cell defects are now well established in the genes for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), fumarate hydratase (FH), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 (FIG. 2). Analysis of the pathophysiological consequences of mitochondrial gene mutations is providing broad new insights into the importance and complexity of mitochondrial alterations in cancer. In this Review I discuss these observations in the context of how alterations in mitochondrial function can signal to the nucleus to change its developmental and replicative status (‘retrograde signalling’) and influence the metabolic status of the surrounding stromal cells (the ‘reverse Warburg effect’). Mutations that affect the expression of mtDNA ρo cells and tumorigenesis The requirement of cancer cells for functional mitochondria has been confirmed by the elimination of mtDNA from various cancer cells through growth in ethidium bromide (ρo cells). The resulting ρo cancer cells have reduced growth rates, decreased colony formation in soft agar and markedly reduced tumour formation in nude mice. The importance of functional mitochondria has been further demonstrated by the transmissible tumours of Tazmanian devils and dogs. These tumours have been transferred from animal to animal for tens of thousands of years and should have died out owing to the decay of their mtDNAs. However, this limitation has been circumvented by the periodic acquisition by tumours of normal mtDNA from host cells. mtDNA mutations and cancer Somatic and germline mtDNA mutations have been reported for a wide variety of cancers. These include renal adenocarcinoma, colon cancer cells, head and neck tumours, astrocytic tumours, thyroid tumours, breast tumours, ovarian tumours, prostate and bladder cancer, neuroblastomas and oncocytomas. Although technical and interpretive errors were common in early publications on mtDNA mutations in cancer, the identification of clearly deleterious mtDNA mutations in cancer tissues — such as an intragenic deletion or the common tRNALeu(UUR) A3243G MELAS mutation — validate the relevance of pathogenic mutations in neoplastic transformation. The importance of the mtDNA in cancer has been confirmed by the exchange of cancer cell mtDNA with pathogenic or normal mtDNA, resulting in alterations of cancer cell phenotypes. Ancient mtDNA population variants have also been correlated with cancer risk. For example, the macro-haplogroup N variant in the complex I, subunit ND3 gene (ND3; also known as MTND3) at nucleotide G10398A (resulting in a T114A amino acid change) has been associated with breast cancer risk in African American women, and the 16519 T to C mtDNA control region variant is associated with endometrial cancer. A mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1; also known as MTCO1) T6777C nucleotide variant has been linked with epithelial ovarian cancer, along with variants in several nDNA mitochondrial genes. Furthermore, the mtDNA control region variant C150 (REF.) has been associated with an increased risk of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer in Chinese women. A meta-analysis of many cancer-associated mtDNA mutations revealed that many cancer cell mtDNA mutations clearly inhibit OXPHOS. However, a significant proportion of the reported variants are the same nucleotide changes that have previously been reported as ancient adaptive mtDNA variants in human populations. Although some of these cancer ‘associations’ are clear misinterpretations of ancient polymorphisms, others may be valid cancer cell mutations. Consequently, there may be two classes of mutations in cancer cell mtDNA: mutations that impair OXPHOS and serve to stimulate neo-plastic transformation, and those that facilitate cancer cell adaption to changing bioenergetic environments. The importance of mtDNA mutations in neoplastic transformation is best illustrated by example. In one prostate tumour a de novo CO1 chain termination mutation was homoplasmic (pure) mutant in the tumour but homoplasmic wild-type in adjacent normal epithelial tissue. This abrupt change in the thousands of copies of mtDNA implies that the CO1 nonsense mutation was under intense positive selection in the cancer cell. In an oncocytoma, the tumour cells were homoplasmic for an ND5 gene frame-shift mutation, and the normal tissues of the patient and his two sisters harboured the same mutation, but at low frequency (low heteroplasmy). Hence, an ND5 frame-shift mutation transmitted through the maternal lineage at low heteroplasmy switched to high heteroplasmy in the tumour, again demonstrating positive selection for the mutant mtDNA. The mtDNA is condensed into nucleoids through the binding of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM; also known as mtTFA). Some colorectal cancers harbour heterozygous TFAM mutations that are associated with mtDNA depletion. TFAM has also been observed to be translocated into the nucleus in prostate cancer cells, and overexpression of TFAM can stimulate cell proliferation. In addition to TFAM, mtDNA nucleoids harbour multiple additional proteins that are involved in mtDNA replication and transcription, one of which is the nuclear-encoded RNA helicase, SUV3 (also known as SUPV3L1). Knockdown of SUV3 results in reduced mtDNA copy number, a shift in mitochondrial morphology, downregulation of OXPHOS enzymes, increased ROS generation, reduced membrane potential and reduced ATP production. Mice heterozygous for a Suv3 null mutation have a reduced lifespan and increased tumour incidence, both of which are associated with increased mtDNA somatic mutation levels and decreased mtDNA copy number. The reduced lifespan and increased tumorigenesis that is evident in a Suv3+/− mother can be transmitted to her Suv3+/+ (wild-type) daughters. Hence, reduced longevity and cancer predilection are the result of Suv3-induced maternally transmitted mtDNA alterations. Although functional mitochondria and mtDNAs are essential for cancer cell growth and tumori genesis, mtDNA mutations and/or reductions in mtDNA copy number that alter the OXPHOS physiology are common features of cancer. This implies that alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolism have a role in initiating and/or sustaining the transformed state. Mitochondrial enzyme defects in cancer In addition to mutations that directly affect mtDNA, mutations in nDNA-encoded mitochondrial enzymes have been found in specific cancers. Analysis of the physiological consequences of these mutations is providing insight into how changes in mitochondrial metabolism can reprogramme the nucleus. SDH mutations Homozygous null mutations in the genes of the various SDH subunits have been observed in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. SDH (also known as respiratory complex II) is an integral mitochondrial inner membrane protein complex that oxidizes succi-nate to fumarate and transfers two electrons to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) (FIG. 2). SDH is composed of four subunits: SDHA–SDHD. SDHA contains an FAD cofactor that binds the substrates succinate and fumarate; SDHB contains the iron–sulphur centre electron carriers; and SDHC and SDHD constitute the inner membrane cytochrome b and form the CoQ binding site. The assembly of SDH requires two factors, SDH assembly factor 1 (SDHAF1) and SDHAF2 (REF.). Initial reports of SDH mutations in paragangliomas involved SDHD, SDHC and SDHB. Subsequent research revealed that cancerous mutations can also occur in SDHA and SDHAF2, with SDH defects accounting for 10–30% of sporadic paragangliomas and 10–70% of familial paragangliomas. Inhibition of SDH increases mitochondrial and cytosolic succinate levels, which inhibits α-ketoglutarate-dependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), thus causing stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). The stabilized HIF1α is then translocated into the nucleus and causes a shift in energy metabolism from oxidative to glycolytic. HIF1α may also be stabilized by the inactivation of PHDs by ROS that have been generated by mitochondrial complex III, as SDH-deficient cells have increased mitochondrial ROS production and oxidative stress. Succinate and fumarate also inhibit other α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including the Jumonji-C histone demethylases (JHDMs) and the TET family of 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases, resulting in genome-wide alterations of histone and DNA methylation and epigenetic dysregulation. FH mutation Homozygous null mutations in the FH gene are associated with multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatas and aggressive forms of renal cell cancer. FH converts fumarate to malate, and cells harbouring FH mutations produce up to 100-fold more fumarate, sevenfold more succinate, and have a marked decrease in malate and citrate levels (FIG. 2). Fumarate has also been hypothesized to inhibit PHDs and stabilize HIF1α. However, in Fh−/− mice the additional knockout of Hif1a increased, rather than decreased, the formation of renal cysts, which are progenitors of papillary renal cell carcinoma. Assuming that the Fh−/− mouse approximates the situation in human tumours, this implies that the stabilization of HIF1α is not required for FH−/− tumorigenesis. Increased fumarate levels have been found to activate the stress response pathway that is regulated by NFE2-related factor 2 (NRF2; also known as NFE2L2). NRF2 is normally kept at low levels though degradation by the kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and the ubiquitin E3 ligase cullin 3 complex. However, excess fumarate can inactivate KEAP1 through succination of cysteines 151 and 288, thereby stabilizing NRF2. NRF2 binds to the antioxidant response elements (AREs) and turns on nDNA stress-response genes, one of which is haem oxygenase 1 (HMOX1). The induction of HMOX1 must be important to tumorigenesis because silencing or inhibiting HMOX1 in Fh−/− cells reduces colony-forming capacity. Inactivation of FH would not only increase fumarate and succinate levels but would also increase succinyl-CoA levels. The induction of HMOX1 could reduce the levels of these metabolites as haem biosynthesis involves combining succinyl-CoA with glycine to generate δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) by ALA synthetase (ALAS) to initiate porphyrin synthesis. Porphyrins are converted to haem, which is degraded by HMOX1 to result in the production and excretion of bilirubin (FIG. 2). This raises the question of why might it be beneficial to reduce succinyl-CoA levels? One possibility could be that when succinyl-CoA is converted to succinate by succinyl-CoA synthetase, GTP is generated. GTP hydrolysis is in turn coupled to the conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by mitochondrial PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK-M), and mitochondrial PEP is exported to the cytosol where it can be converted to pyruvate and ATP. If succinyl-CoA were in excess, this reaction could deplete the mitochondrion of OAA that is required for citrate synthesis and lipid biogenesis. Moreover, excess GTP might adversely affect the homeostasis of the mitochondrial nucleotide pool and compromise mtDNA transcription and replication. IDH1 and IDH2 Heterozygous missense mutations in the two NADP+-dependent IDH enzymes, cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2, have been observed in gliomas, astrocytomas, chondromas and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). A third IDH, NAD+-dependent IDH3, is the primary TCA cycle enzyme for decarboxylating isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (FIG. 2), yet this enzyme has not been found to be mutated in cancer. In gliomas, the common IDH mutations are IDH1-R132, IDH2-R172 (the analogous amino acid to IDH1-R132) and IDH2-R140. IDH2-R140 is also the most common IDH mutation in AML. Additional rare IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have also been reported. IDHs are homodimer enzymes, and the cancer cell mutations identified to date create a neomorphic function. Like IDH3, IDH1 and IDH2 can oxidatively decarboxylate isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. However, IDH1 and IDH2 reduce NADP+ instead of NAD+, and the NADP+-dependent reaction is reversible because NADPH can provide sufficient energy to drive the reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate to isocitrate (FIG. 4). However, the neomorphic IDH1-R132 and IDH2-R172 mutants use NADPH to reduce α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate ((R)-2HG). As a result, IDH1 and IDH2 mutant cancers produce 10–100-fold increased levels of (R)-2HG, which has been hypothesized to be an ‘oncometabolite’. Contrary to expectations, (R)-2HG has been shown to activate PHD1 (also known as EGLN2) and PHD2 (also known as EGLN1) resulting in decreased HIF1α, unlike the S-enantiomer, which inhibits PHD1 and PHD2. Furthermore, in IDH1-R132H-transformed astrocytes, knockdown of HIF1α increases cellular proliferation and cloning in soft agar, indicating that in this context HIF1α may act as a tumour suppressor gene. (R)-2HG is associated with alterations in cellular genomic methylation and transcription patterns and is a potent inhibitor of the α-ketoglutarate-dependent Jumonji-C domain histone Nε-lysine demethylases (JMJD2A, JMJD2C and JMJD2D (also known as KDM4D)). Hence, (R)-2HG may act by altering chromatin modifications. As human astrocytes transformed with IDH-R132H exhibit heightened proliferation at confluence after approximately 14 passages, this suggests that (R)-2HG causes a progressive change in the cellular epigenome. In fact, transduction of mutant IDH1 results in a rapid increase in trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and a subsequent increase in DNA CpG island methylation. Excessive CpG island methylation (the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)) is seen in a subset of glioblastomas, and CIMP correlates almost perfectly with IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. Glioblastomas with IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and CIMP exhibit striking changes in gene expression profile, with differential methylation of over 3,000 genes. The target genes showing marked changes include transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), RAS, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), WNT and genes in angiogensis pathways. As the WNT pathway, among others, has been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, such global changes in chromatin structure could accompany alterations in bioenergetics. Indeed, rendering cancer cells mtDNA-deficient (ρo) also results in alterations in CpG island methylation patterns. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may also alter the cellular redox state. Mitochondria produce NADPH by the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADH to NADP+. This reaction is mediated by the mitochondrial inner membrane enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT), with the energy differential between NADH at –250 mV and NADPH at –405 mV being supplied by the mitochondrial inner membrane electrochemical potential (FIG. 4). The importance of the mitochondrial production of NADPH is demonstrated by the multiple metabolic abnormalities that are observed in Nnt−/− mice. Whereas NADH is oxidized to produce energy, NADPH is used as a reductant for biosynthetic reactions, the glutathione-based detoxification of peroxides, and the regulation of thiol-disulphide enzymes and transcription factors. Using NNT-generated NADPH, mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate can be reductively carboxylated to isocitrate by IDH2 (REF.). Isocitrate can then be converted to citrate by mitochondrial aconitase. Citrate can be exported to the cytosol where it can be converted to isocitrate by cytosolic aconitase and to α-ketoglutarate by IDH1, generating cytosolic NADPH. α-ketoglutarate or glutamate can then be returned to the mitochondrion to complete the cycle (FIG. 4). As both the mitochondria and the cytosol require NADPH for antioxidant defences, the flux of NADPH from the mitochondrion to the cytosol must be regulated to retain NADPH when the mitochondrion is under increased oxidative stress. This may be accomplished by the acute sensitivity of the iron-sulphur centre of the mitochondrial aconitase to inactivation by oxidative stress, inactivation of which would stop the cycle and block the export of mitochondrial NADPH (FIG. 4). In heterozygous IDH1 and IDH2 cancer cells the altered IDH activity could generate a futile cycle, which wastes NADPH and α-ketoglutarate. The wild-type IDH1 or IDH2 proteins would generate NADPH from the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate but then the mutant IDH1 and IDH2 proteins would expend the NADPH to convert α-ketoglutarate to (R)-2HG (FIG. 4). The resulting decrease in NADPH levels would inhibit glutathione peroxidase, thus increasing H2O2 levels with heightened signalling effects. Decreased NADPH production would also inhibit the thioredoxins and the bifunctional apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1; also known as redox factor 1 (REF1)), thus perturbing the redox status of crucial transcription factors and favouring proliferation and tumorigenesis. Recently, a transgenic mouse has been reported in which an IDH1-R132H allele is expressed in haematopoietic cells. The NAD+, NADP+, NADH and NADPH levels in bone-marrow-derived macrophages of these animals were reported to be unchanged. However, these experiments seem to have been performed on the Jackson Laboratory C57BL/6j background, which is homozygous for deletion of Nnt. Hence, differential effects on the NADPH/NADP+ ratio may not have been apparent in this experimental system. Mitochondrial ROS production and redox biology NADPH is essential for the reduction of mitochondri-ally generated H2O2 and other peroxides by glutathione and glutathione peroxidases. When mitochondrial ROS production is too high, it is toxic to the cell and can induce apoptosis or necrosis. However, mitochondrial ROS are also important signalling molecules and potent mitogens, so if apoptosis is inhibited increased ROS production can contribute to neoplastic transformation. NADPH is also essential for the regulation of the protein function through reduction of thiols (-SH) (FIG 4). For example, when cysteine thiols in the FOS–JUN heterodimer, which constitute an AP-1 transcription factor, are oxidized to sulphenic acids, the affinity of AP-1 for binding sites in target genes is blocked. However, the FOS–JUN sulphenic acids can be reduced by the bifunctional APE1 protein, the reducing equivalents from NADPH being transmitted through the nuclear–cytosolic thioredoxin 1 (TRX1). APE1 also regulates NRF2, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), p53, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), oestrogen receptor (ER) and HIF1α by reducing cysteine residues in these proteins that are required for DNA binding. The mitochondrion has its own thioredoxin, TRX2, and also imports APE1, so protein redox regulation is also crucial for mitochondrial function (FIG. 4). Mitochondrial ROS production and redox balance are modulated by the mitochondrial inner membrane electrochemical gradient. The mitochondrial H+-translocating ATP synthase (known as ATP synthase or complex V) uses the proton gradient to produce ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) (FIGS 2,3). Inhibition of the ATP synthase by oligomycin results in the maximization of the mitochondrial inner membrane polarization, which stalls the electron transport chain (ETC) and reduces the electron carriers in complexes I and III and CoQ. The excess electrons can then be transferred directly to O2 to generate superoxide (O2•−). Mitochondrial matrix superoxide can be dismutated into H2O2 by Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD; encoded by SOD2) while intermembrane-space O2•−, which is primarily generated by complex III, is dismutated by intermembrane and cytosolic Cu/ZnSOD (also known as SOD1) (FIG. 3). H2O2 at increased levels then functions as a diffusible signalling molecule. Inhibition of the ATP synthase has been observed in various carcinomas. This can result from increased levels of the ATP synthase inhibitor protein IF1 or inhibition of the transcription or translation of the ATP synthase catalytic β-subunit. Knockdown of the increased levels of IF1 in carcinomas results in a decline in glycolysis and an increase in OXPHOS. As observed with oligo mycin, inhibition of the ATP synthase increases the mitochondrial membrane potential, stalls the ETC and increases ROS production. Alterations in bioenergetic metabolism in cancer The PI3K pathway The shift from oxidative to more glycolytic metabolism commonly involves activation of the PI3K–PTEN–AKT signal transduction pathway, which is one of the most common changes found in cancer. PI3K–PTEN–AKT pathway activation increases the cell surface expression of transporters for glucose and other nutrients, enhances the expression of glycolytic and lipogenesis genes, stimulates hexokinase and phosphofructokinase to drive glycolysis, and activates mTOR. Consistent with the importance of the PI3K–PTEN–AKT pathway in cancer, cancer cells use not only high levels of glucose but also convert over 90% of the resulting pyruvate into lactate by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). The PI3K–PTEN–AKT pathway also inhibits expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA, the rate limiting step for fatty acid oxidation, and phosphorylates hexokinase II, enabling it to bind to the mitochondrial outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC; also known as porin) (FIG. 3). There, hexokinase II captures mitochondrial ATP and uses it to phosphorylate glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, thus driving carbon flow into glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway. In Caenorhabditis elegans, insulin-like ligands bind to the DAF-2 receptor (the insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor analogue), which activates AKT. AKT phosphorylates DAF-16 (the FOXO analogue), resulting in the exclusion of DAF-16 from the nucleus. Inactivation of DAF-2 permits DAF-16 to enter the nucleus and upregulate antioxidant and stress defences, thus extending lifespan. In mammals, there are four FOXO proteins (FOXO1 (also known as FKBR), FOXO3A, FOXO4 and FOXO6) that bind to insulin-response elements (IREs). The mitochondrial transcriptional co-activator, peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)-co-activator 1α (PGC1α; encoded by PPARGC1A), has three IREs. These are bound by unphosphorylated FOXO1 and this increases PPARGC1A transcription. Expression of PGC1α induces many nDNA-encoded mitochondrial genes, including those for OXPHOS and antioxidant defences. Therefore, activation of the PI3K–PTEN–AKT pathway should remove the FOXOs from the nucleus and downregulate mitochondrial function and antioxidant defences. However, overexpression of FOXO3A has been reported to downregulate mitochondrial function. This occurs through the induction of MAX-interacting protein 1 (MXI1), which inhibits the transcriptional activity of MYC by binding the MYC partner protein MAX. As MYC can induce mitochondrial biogenesis by promoting the transcription of relevant genes, FOXO3A activation must decrease mitochondrial OXPHOS. FOXO3A has also been shown to induce SOD2, which can decrease mitochondrial ROS production. Furthermore, FOXO3A lowered ROS levels in the presence of hypoxia and prevented the stabilization of HIF1α. As HIF1 can repress mitochondrial biogenesis, its degradation would be expected to increase mitochondrial biogenesis. Hence, the bioenergetic effects of FOXO inactivation are complex and must be context-specific. Although glycolysis can rapidly produce ATP under low oxygen tension, it is also important for generating the precursors and reducing equivalents for cellular biogenesis and antioxidant defences. In glycolysis, pyruvate kinase (PK), which converts PEP to pyruvate, is the rate-limiting step for pyruvate synthesis. In cancer cells it is frequently argued that the common tissue isoform PKM1 is switched to PKM2. However, a recent proteomic analysis concluded that both PKM1 and PKM2 are expressed in normal and cancerous tissues, and that PKM2 is consistently the predominant isoform. PKM2 can be inhibited by Tyr105 phosphorylation by various tyrosine kinases including fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1. Phosphorylation disrupts the active tetramer form, thus releasing the cofactor fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. PKM2 can also be inhibited by oxidative stress through modification of Cys358 (REF.). Inhibition of PKM2 redirects carbon from oxidation to the anabolic pathways that emanate from glucose-6-phosphate. These include the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates both ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH for redox control, and glycolysis, which generates glycerol-3-phosphate for lipid synthesis. When oxidative stress is low, PKM2 is active and glucose is metabolized to pyruvate and lactate to generate ATP, but when oxidative stress is high PMK2 is inactive and glucose- 6-phosphate is shunted into the pentose phosphate pathway to generate NADPH for antioxidant defences. Acetyl-CoA regulation Mitochondrial and cytosolic acetyl-CoA can be hydrolysed by the mitochondria to generate ATP. Acetyl-CoA is also required for cytosolic lipid synthesis and is the co-reactant in the acetylation of proteins that modulate the signal transduction pathways and epigenome. Much of the cellular acetyl-CoA is generated within the mitochondrion from pyruvate and fatty acid oxidation. Cytosolic pyruvate is imported into the mitochondrion by the pyruvate carrier and converted to acetyl-CoA by mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH is inactivated through phosphorylation by PDH kinase (PDHK) and is reactivated by PDH phosphatases. When reducing equivalents in the ETC are limited, the mitochondrial inter membrane space contains a signalosome complex encompassing protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), retinol, cytochrome c and p66SHC that increases acetyl-CoA flux into the mitochondrion from pyruvate by inhibiting PDHK2 (REF.). Acetyl-CoA is also generated within the mitochondrion by the oxidation of fatty acids. Fatty acyl-CoA molecules are imported into the mitochondrion via carnitine: the transfer from CoA to carnitine is mediated by carnitine palmitoyltransferases. The carnitine palmitoyltransferase isoform 1C is upregulated in lung cancer, indicating the importance of mitochondrial energy and precursor production for this type of cancer cell. Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is essential for fatty acid bio-genesis. One important source of cytosolic acetyl-CoA is the export from the mitochondrion of citrate. In the cytosol citrate is then cleaved by the cytosolic ATP-dependent lyase to OAA and acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA can then be used to synthesize fatty acids, sphingomyelin, cholesterol and isoprenoids, and can also be used in other acetylation reactions. MYC and glutaminolysis Citrate production requires not only acetyl-CoA but also OAA. However, the appropriation of citrate for macromolecular synthesis depletes mitochondrial OAA, thus impeding the TCA cycle. This deficiency can be compensated by the expression of the MYC oncogene, which induces glutaminolysis to feed α-ketoglutarate into the TCA cycle to regenerate OAA, a process known as anaplerosis. Increased expression levels of MYC are seen in many aggressive tumours and have been found to upregulate mitochondrial oxygen consumption and mitochondrial biogenesis. This is associated with transcriptional induction of TFAM, as well as the genes for subunits of complex I, uncoupling proteins, mitochondrial membrane proteins and genes involved in intermediary metabolism. MYC upregulation of mitochondrial function is associated with induction of glutaminase, which converts glutamine to glutamate. MYC also inhibits the expression of the microRNAs miR-23a and miR-23b, which are translational inhibitors of glutaminase. Glutamate is converted to α-ketoglutarate by mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase, and α-ketoglutarate progresses around the TCA cycle to OAA. Hence, MYC activation of mitochondrial function and glutaminolysis renders cancer cells glutamine-dependent. p53 and mitochondria The tumour suppressor p53 (encoded by TP53) can mediate growth arrest and initiate apoptosis. However, it can also be phosphorylated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in response to energy limitation, thus activating cell cycle checkpoints. p53 also favours ATP production by OXPHOS and the decrease of cellular ROS production by inducing TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR). TIGAR negatively regulates glycolysis by degrading fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which is an allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase 1 (REF.). This shifts carbon flux away from glycolysis and into the pentose phosphate pathway, which increases NADPH production and thus heightens antioxidant defences. p53 also negatively regulates phosphoglycerate mutase and AKT, thus further inhibiting glycolysis and upregulating OXPHOS complex IV by the induction of the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) Cu2+ chaperone, SCO2 (REF.). Because the inhibition of glycolysis can redirect glucose-6-phosphate into the pentose phosphate pathway, this could increase antioxidant defences in conjunction with increased OXPHOS. Thus, the inactivation of p53 should decrease OXPHOS in favour of glycolysis, increase ROS production and inhibit apoptosis. In other contexts, p53 activation can also induce cellular senescence. Excessive shortening of chromosomal telomeres activates p53, which then inhibits the transcription of PGC1α and PGC1β. This results in diminished mitochondrial function, increased ROS levels and senescence. HIF and mitochondria The transcription factor HIF1 induces glycolysis under low oxygen tension through the upregulation of genes encoding glucose transporters, glycolytic proteins and angiogenic factors (such as erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), and the inhibition of mitochondrial function. HIF1 affects mitochondria by various mechanisms: it induces PDHK1, thus inhibiting PDH and retarding the conversion of pyruvate to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA; it induces the low oxygen tension subunit of complex IV, COX4-2; it upregulates the mitochondrial LON protease to degrade the normoxic subunit, COX4-1; it activates mitophagy to degrade existing mitochondria; and it inhibits MYC signalling. HIF1 also upregulates the transcription of miR-210, which downregulates mitochondrial metabolism by inhibiting expression of the ISCU1 and ISCU2 genes — which encode proteins involved in iron sulphur centre synthesis — and genes for subunits of complex I (NDUFA4), complex II (SDHD) and complex IV (COX10). Mitochondria also regulate HIF1. Mitochondrial ROS from complex III has been shown to inactivate PHD2 and thus to stabilize HIF1α. Mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) also modulates HIF1α through mitochondrially generated ROS. Additionally, mitochondria can stabilize HIF1α through the action of the coiled-coil–helix–coiled-coil–helix (CHCH) domain protein CHCHD4 isoforms, which are part of the mitochondrial protein disulphide relay system involving cytochrome c and complex IV. Finally, HIF1 mediates the transcription of PKM2, but not PKM1, and PKM2 also serves as a co-transcriptional activator of HIF1. This is mediated by PHD3, which hydroxylates prolines 403 and 408 of PKM2, thus enhancing the binding of PKM2 to HIF1α. Calcium, mitochondria and apoptosis Mitochondrial physiology is strongly regulated by Ca2+ (REFS). Mitochondria import Ca2+ through the Ca2+ uniporter, which is energized by an electrochemical gradient. Mitochondrially associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) bring the endoplasmic reticulum type 3 inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ release channels into juxtaposition with the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein resides in MAMs, and its inactivation leads to the AKT-mediated hyperphosphorylation of the IP3R3 channels and reduced Ca2+ flux. Because excessive Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria can activate the mtPTP and initiate apoptosis, inactivation of PML may limit apoptosis and increase cancer cell survival. Mitochondrial retrograde signalling As mitochondrial gene mutations are common in cancer, but mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS genes are essential for cancer cell survival and growth, mutations in mitochondrial genes must therefore be altering cellular bioenergetics and metabolism in ways that are important for neoplastic transformation. For SDH defects this involves the activation of HIF1 signalling; for FH defects, alteration of NRF2 signalling; for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, alteration of redox signalling; and for all four genes, alteration of chromatin methylation and of the epigenome. Thus, mitochondrial cancer mutations must serve to reprogramme the nucleus, a process called retrograde signalling. The importance of retrograde signalling has been clearly demonstrated for changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ signalling and in mitochondrial ROS production and redox control. The importance of mitochondrial Ca2+ regulation in retrograde signalling has been shown by transiently treating cells, such as mouse myoblast C2C12 cells, with either ethidium bromide (to reduce the mtDNA content 50–80%) or with the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Both treatments decrease the mitochondrial inner membrane electrochemical potential. These treatments convert the C2C12 cells from being nontumorigenic to having invasive growth patterns in transplantation experiments. A decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential reduces the energetic drive for mitochondria to import Ca2+, thus increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Cytosolic Ca2+ activates calcineurin, which activates IκBβ-dependent NF-κB to cause the nuclear translocation of the REL–p50 heterodimer. REL–p50 then associates with C/EBPδ, CREB and NFAT in a nuclear enhance-osome. Calcineurin also activates insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), which acts through PI3K to activate AKT. Phospho-AKT enters the nucleus where it phosphorylates and activates heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (HNRNPA2), which acts as a transcriptional co-activator of the enhanceosome. These changes result in the transcriptional upregulation of over 120 nDNA genes. Notably, affected genes include those for maintaining Ca2+ regulation and homeostasis (such as ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1), calsequestrin and calreticulin), glucose metabolism (such as IGF1R, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), GLUT4 and hexokinase), apoptosis (such as AKT1, PI3K, BCL-XS, BID, BAD and BAX), and tissue invasiveness and tumorigenesis (such as cathepsin L, AKT1, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), p53 and mouse melanoma antigen). The importance of ROS and redox signalling in cancer has been demonstrated for HIF1α stabilization, FOS–JUN activation, and activation of proliferation through regulation of the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPK pathway. Direct evidence that mitochondrial ROS are important in neoplastic transformation has come from the analysis of mtDNA mutations found in cultured cancer cells. For example, analyses of mtDNA in mouse L cells has shown that each cell harbours a functional mtDNA mutation and that these mutated mtDNAs increase mitochondrial ROS production and cellular proliferation. The mtDNA mutation ATP6 T8993G — which is found in patients with neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) and Leigh syndrome — results in increased ROS production and tumorigenicity when expressed in the prostate cancer cell line PC3 and HeLa cells. The growth stimulation of the ATP6 mutation can be inhibited by targeting normal ATP6 protein into the mutant mitochondria through allotropic gene expression. A human cell line with an ND5 frameshift mutation and low ROS production had low tumorigenicity, but when the frameshift mtDNA was mixed with wild-type mtDNA ROS production and tumorigenicity increased. Over 30 years ago, it was observed that the fusion of a nontumorigenic hamster cytoplast (an enucleated cell) with a more cancerous hamster cell could partially suppress tumorigenicity. Cytoplasts harbouring mtDNAs with either an ND6 missense or frameshift mutation produce high ROS levels in association with high tumorigenicity when fused with cells with low tumorigenicity, indicating that the constituent mitochondria can transfer these tumorigenic traits. The high tumorigenicity of the original tumour cells and their derived cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids) is associated with increased HIF1α and MCL1 expression. KRAS-transformed cells produce increased ROS from mitochondrial complex III and this is required for maintaining anchorage-independent growth. These effects of KRAS are inhibited in ρo cells, in cells in which TFAM has been knocked down, and in cells treated with mitochondri-ally targeted antioxidants, all of which inhibit mitochondrial ROS production. Carbon flow through glycolysis is also diminished in these cells, which redirect the carbon into the pentose phosphate pathway to generate NADPH and ribose. Although ROS are required for anchorage-independent growth, it follows that chronically increased mitochondrial ROS levels would severely damage mitochondria and mtDNAs. Perhaps to compensate for this effect, RAS-transformed cancer cells are addicted to autophagy, and inhibition of this function results in a decline of mitochondrial function. Proof of the importance of mitochondrial ROS production comes from the suppression of tumorigenesis by the genetic introduction of a mitochondrially targeted catalase (mCAT) into mice harbouring the polyoma middle T oncoprotein or the ApcMin/+;Tfam+/− genotype. Catalase is a peroxisomal enzyme that rapidly degrades H2O2 to O2 and H2O. In the mCAT transgene the catalase cDNA is modified to remove the carboxy-terminal peroxisomal-targeting sequence, which is replaced by an amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. Hence, removal of mitochondrial H2O2 can inhibit nDNA-oncogene-induced tumorigenesis. The reverse Warburg effect From the discussions above, it is clear that different types of tumours undergo different bioenergetic adjustments; tumours do not consistently inhibit mitochondrial bioenergetics as suggested by Warburg. Indeed, one study of the energy budget of various cancer cells under normoxic conditions concluded that most of the ATP in cancer cells comes from mitochondria, as is true for normal cells. If this is the case, then why can cancers be detected using FDG accumulation? The answer may lie with the interaction between the tumour cells and the adjacent stromal cells. It has been observed that stromal fibroblasts that are associated with breast cancer epithelial cells are glycolytic. The conversion of these fibroblasts from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism is induced by the H2O2 that is secreted from the adjacent cancer cells. This results in loss of caveolin 1 from the fibroblasts, and this in turn causes induction of mitophagy. Mitophagy reduces the number of mitochondria in the stromal fibroblasts, thus reducing mitochondrial function and switching the fibroblast metabolism over to glycolysis. The increased glycolysis due to mitochondrial turnover generates excessive stromal cell lactate and ketones, which are secreted into the intracellular space. The cancer cells then take up the lactate and ketones and use them to feed cancer cell mitochondrial energy production and to generate mitochondrial precursors for cancer cell biogenesis. This metabolic coupling between breast cancer epithelial cells and the stromal fibroblasts renders much of the surrounding tissue glycolytic, which would enhance an FDG signal. This intercellular cooperation has been designated ‘stromal–epithelial metabolic coupling’ or the ‘reverse Warburg effect’ and is analogous to the ‘neuron–glia metabolic coupling’ that is seen in normal brain tissue and in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease.",6017
30144423,"MITOCHONDRIA: THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL Mitochondria are essential organelles derived from endosymbiotic bacteria, necessary for cellular activity. They are an exceptional example of natural selection, as the host allowed their coevolution since most of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome. Mitochondria, however, retain a small 16 Kb DNA genome that encodes tRNAs, rRNAs, and proteins essential for respiration. Indeed, they are the powerhouse of the cell. These organelles are maternally inherited with 1 cell containing hundreds of mitochondria that can be wild-type (a state referred to as homoplasmy) or exist in mixtures of wild-type and mutant forms (heteroplasmy) dependently on the mtDNA. The system regulating turnover of mitochondria is known as mitophagy, a mechanism by which damaged or excess mitochondria are selectively eliminated. Mitophagy is accompanied by the balance of fission (the separation of long, tubular mitochondria into 2 or more smaller parts) and fusion (the combination of two mitochondria into a single organelle). As the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria are essential bioenergetic and biosynthetic factories critical for normal cell function. They use substrates from cytoplasm to drive fatty acid oxidation (FAO), the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the Krebs cycle, the electron transport chain (ETC), and respiration, to synthesize the molecules essential for the construction of macromolecules including amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, heme, and iron-sulfur clusters, and to regenerate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate for antioxidant defense. Reducing agents NADH and hydroquinone form of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2), produced by Krebs cycle, are indispensable and allow, by the ETC, generation of a proton gradient throughout the mitochondrial inner membrane (cristae) that generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by way of the H+-ATP synthase enzyme. This enzyme allows protons to cross the membrane in a single direction, according to the process of chemiosmosis. This metabolic pathway is called oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), in which cells oxidize nutrients to produce ATP. During this mechanism, electrons are transferred from electron donors to electron acceptors, such as molecular oxygen, in the redox reaction. The reduction of oxygen can potentially produce harmful intermediates called reactive oxygen species (ROS), like superoxide or peroxide anions. Cytochrome c oxidase, complex IV, can, however, ameliorate these by-products by reducing oxygen to water. The OXPHOS mechanism is highly efficient with 36 ATP molecules as the maximum yield from an initial glucose molecule. MITOCHONDRIA AND CANCER Tumor cell phenotypes are characterized by genetic alterations driving the expression of 10 main characteristics: genetic instability, sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, avoiding immune destruction, sustain promoting inflammation resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, deregulating cellular energetics, activating invasion, and metastasis. Warburg observed that cancer cells can reprogram their metabolism by switching from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and consequently to lactic acid fermentation, even in the presence of oxygen, leading to a state that has been termed “aerobic glycolysis.” Unlike the high energy yield of OXPHOS, the conversion of a glucose molecule into lactate leads to the low-energy yield with the formation of only 2 ADP molecules. However, although the energetic yield per molecule of glucose is much lower for aerobic glycolysis compared with OXPHOS, when glucose is in excess and flux through the pathway high, glycolysis has the potential to produce ATP in greater quantities and at a faster rate. Some cancer cells operate in this manner because glycolysis allows the production of intermediates that can be used in various biosynthetic pathways, such as the genesis of nucleotides and amino acids, necessary during cell proliferation. The so-called Warburg effect, indeed, is also observed in embryonic tissues cells in the proliferative phase. Moreover, embryonic tissues, as well as proliferating tumor cells are not deficient in nutrients, so they can “waste” glucose molecules with a respiratory mechanism that is not as efficient as that of OXPHOS. Therefore, Warburg’s hypothesis that cancer cells change their metabolism due to a mitochondrial defect cannot be a general rule. Functional mitochondria are essential for the development of tumor cells, and this has been confirmed by the creation of ρo cancer cells, deficient in mtDNA or knocking down mitochondria transcription factor (Tfam). Indeed, these cells have reduced tumor formation in nude mice. Mutations that damage bioenergetic system enzymes have been found in cancer cells, as well as mutations on mtDNA. Mitochondrial mutations have been described for some tumor cells: mtDNA control region variants are associated with endometrial and cervical cancer; mutation in NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 complex I (ND3) gene has been associated with breast cancer risk; a mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) nucleotide variant has been linked with epithelial ovarian cancer. We can divide carcinogenic mutations that involve energy system into two classes: (1) mitochondrial enzyme mutations that have a negative effect on the OXPHOS mechanism that leads to the tumor phenotype development; (2) mutations that facilitate the adaptation of tumor cell to the microenvironment constantly changing over the disease progression. Altered OXPHOS in cancer cells. Most of mitochondrial enzyme mutations lead to loss of functionality of enzymes with consequent stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). HIF-1α is a transcription factor that, when stabilized, is translocated into the nucleus and causes a shift in energy metabolism from oxidative to glycolytic. Inhibition of SDH (Succinate Dehydrogenase, an integral mitochondrial inner membrane protein complex that oxidizes succinate to fumarate and transfers 2 electrons to coenzyme Q10) increases mitochondrial and cytosolic succinate levels, which inhibits α-ketoglutarate-dependent prolyl hydroxylases, inducing stabilization of HIF1α. Mutations that lead to loss of SDH functionality have been found in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. Mutations in fumarate hydratase (FH) gene can stabilize HIF-1α transcription factor as well. FH converts fumarate to malate and lack of function of FH results in increased levels of fumarate and succinate. Fumarate, like succinate has also been hypothesized to inhibit prolyl hydroxylases and stabilize HIF-1α. Homozygous null mutations in FH gene are associated with multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatas and aggressive forms of renal cell cancer. Mutations in another family of mitochondrial enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), results in an energy shift in tumor cells and has been characterized as mutations that result in the generation of IDH1 and IDH2 variants. The wild-type form of these enzymes allows the conversion of isocitrate in α-ketoglutarate while mutant variations reduce α-ketoglutarate to R(−)-2-hydroxyglutarate (R)-2HG). Consequently, (R)-2HG has been shown to cause epigenetic methylation, know to alter expression of target genes. Among the genes that are targeted is WNT gene. Wnt signaling activates mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) gene expression. In conclusion, it is evident that mutations in mtDNA lead to mitochondrial dysfunction that consequently causes changes in nuclear gene expression, a mechanism called retrograde signaling. This mechanism likely permits tumor cells to adapt to stringent metabolic requirements and foster tumor progression. IMPACT OF CANCER ON STROMA METABOLISM, “THE REVERSE WARBURG EFFECT” Cancer cells can be viewed to adapt to unfavorable conditions such as altered and reduced energetic substrate, reduced oxygen tension, variation in environmental temperature, increased ROS toxicity, and exposure to conditions that induce apoptosis. The development of these adverse conditions can be attributable to the presence of the cancer cells and their impaired metabolism. An example that illustrates this phenomenon is observed in breast cancer cells. Stromal fibroblasts associated in breast cancer epithelial cells are glycolytic; this metabolism switch is induced by the H2O2 released by adjacent cancer cells. This results in loss of caveolin 1 by fibroblasts, which in turn causes induction of mitophagy in these stromal fibroblasts: this self-cannibalism reduces mitochondrial function and switches the fibroblast metabolism over to glycolysis. The lactate and ketones that are produced are utilized by cancer cells to feed mitochondrial energy production. This intercellular cooperation has been designated “reverse Warburg effect.” This study demonstrates that the metabolic alteration in the tumor cell is not always caused by a mitochondrial defect, but it can be born from mutations that favor the adaptation to a new environment. Paraphrasing Brandon et al “the tumorigenic mutations are analogous to human pathogenic mutations while the tumor adaptive mutations are analogous to the human regional adaptive variants.” MITOCHONDRIA AND METABOLISM IN IMMUNE SYSTEM There is no doubt that the cellular energy system, complex and finely regulated, is responsible not only for forming the fuel necessary for cells’ survival but also for other cellular processes, specific according to the cell type. Therefore, events that guide the plasticity of the mitochondria can cause consequences not only in terms of energy metabolism but also favoring a tumor microenvironment. In the following sections we will give some examples of how mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetic reactions, mitochondrial structures, and energy metabolites can cause changes in the immune system cellular activity and how the cells are affected in case they are defective. DEFECT IN T CELL MITOCHONDRIA BIOGENESIS REPRESSES ANTICANCER RESPONSES The presence of T cells within tumors, in a landmark study, was shown to correlate with improved clinical outcomes. Later the correlation was confirmed for many other tumor types including, for example, melanoma and breast cancer. T cells play a pivotal role in the antitumor immune response and as all other cells, needs a functional energy source to carry out its cellular functions. Therefore, it is necessary that T cells have an abundant supply of nutrients and the efficient machinery to generate energy. T cells, once activated, have an enormous demand for energy as they exponentially proliferate and synthesize inflammatory cytokines among other activities. Scharping et al observed that tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) display a phenotype of metabolic insufficiency, prominently characterized by persistent loss of mitochondrial function and mass. The hypothesis is that chronic activation, associated with the anticancer response, represses oxidative metabolism. Inflammatory-mediated activation in cancerous state and chronic viral infections lead to an augmented energy demand that T cells are unable to satisfy. Chronic activation may drive the T cells on sustained reliance on glycolysis in tissue sites where most of the available glucose is consumed by tumor cells. Scharping et al propose that sustained activation of T cells in cancer promotes a defect in mitochondrial biogenesis due to a defect in PPAR-gamma coactivator 1α (PGC1α)-programmed mitochondrial biogenesis. Indeed, metabolic reprogramming of T cells through enforced PGC1α expression rescued mitochondrial function and induced superior antitumor responses characterized by cytokine production and tumor control. PGC1a is repressed by protein kinase B (Akt) and Sharping et al showed increased AKT activation in CD8+ TILs. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)—phosphatase PTEN—AKT signal transduction pathway drives changes in metabolism to promote cancer cell growth and proliferation. Indeed, AKT pharmacologic inhibition enables TIL expansion. Growth factor-dependent activation of PI3K leads to the activation of downstream effectors including Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that coordinates metabolic activities that support cellular biosynthesis. In normal cells, PI3K activation is tightly controlled by dephosphorylation of PIP3 by the phosphatase PTEN, a potent tumor suppressor. Together, mutations in PI3K signaling constitute one of the most common mutations in human tumors. Enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling selectively gives tumors an advantage through several pathways, including (1) increased surface expression of nutrient transporters resulting in increased uptake of glucose, (2) Akt-dependent stimulation of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase to drive glycolysis, (3) enhanced transcription of genes involved in glycolysis, and (4) enhanced protein translation through Akt-dependent mTOR activation. Exhausted T cells fail to secrete cytokines and express high levels of coinhibitory molecules like Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). PD-1 and CTLA-4 signaling inhibit glycolysis, mechanism necessary to delineate an active phenotype for T cells. Distinctly, unlike CTLA-4 signaling, PD-1 signaling can promote fatty acid oxidation, commonly observed in memory T cells. Additionally, CTLA-4 interacts with protein phosphatase 2 a key enzyme that inhibits mTOR signaling, a crucial signaling cascade for T cell differentiation and function. THE IMPACT OF MITOCHONDRIAL MASS IN T CELL PHENOTYPE Since efficient metabolism is fundamental for normal cellular function, it is not surprising that an inadequate antitumor response is also caused by glitches in the gears of the cellular drivetrain, such as the reduction of the number of mitochondria as discussed. Not only in the number of mitochondria, but also the mitochondrial shape is involved in lymphocyte activity. Mitochondria are not inert during metabolic changes in T cells. Indeed, T lymphocytes can be differentiated into T naive, T effectors, and T memory based on the mitochondrial mass analysis. Naïve T cell have fragmented and round mitochondria and during activation in effector T cells (Teff) there is an increase in the fission rate and, therefore, the increase in the number of mitochondria, with looser cristae. Looser cristae may lead to the dissociation of ETC supercomplexes that may result in less efficient OXPHOS and promoting aerobic glycolysis. This could assist T cell activation and proliferation. Without tight cristae and efficient ETC activity, electrons may linger in the complexes resulting in the generation of ROS. In contrast, memory T cells (Tm cells) have greater numbers of mitochondria than Teff and are elongated as a result of decreased fission rate. Fused, elongated mitochondria have efficient ETC super complex formation and OXPHOS, which may assist in cell survival and functions. METABOLIC STATUS IMPACT T CELLS AND MACROPHAGES DIFFERENTIATION As we have mentioned, OXPHOS has been an intensely studied mechanism in recent years in the oncology field: OXPHOS inefficiency in favor of glycolysis in tumor cells is considered a hallmark characteristic. The metabolic switch toward glycolysis from OXPHOS leads to polarization toward a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment. Accumulation of the metabolite succinate leads to the stabilization of the HIF-1α and, subsequently, to the expression of a set of genes including genes that permit the switch toward a glycolytic metabolism. In the previous paragraph, we reviewed that, for Teff cells, the glycolytic metabolism is influenced by the mitochondrial conformation. Additional evidence includes the stabilization of the HIF-1α factor, which not only allows glycolytic metabolism, but also allows differentiation of cells with proinflammatory activity. HIF-1α enhances Th17 development through direct transcriptional activation of the RAR-related orphan receptor γT which upon upregulation attenuates regulatory genes involved in regulatory T cells development by binding forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) and targeting it for proteasomal degradation. HIF-1α expression in T cells can be induced both by hypoxic and nonhypoxic stimuli, including T cell receptor-triggered stimuli. In addition to Teff cells, HIF-1 also plays a role in the inflammatory response in macrophages. Macrophages exposed to hypoxia accumulate both HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and overexpression of HIF-2α in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is specifically correlated with high-grade human tumors and poor prognosis. HIF-1α stabilization by succinate occurs in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages, a process driven by signaling from Toll-like receptors TLR4. Stabilization of HIF-1α followed by upregulation of genes including IL-1B, which encodes IL-1β, allows the metabolic shift toward glycolysis. Although succinate and SDH activity are essential for the generation of a proinflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages, prolonged SDH activity and ROS production result in hyperinflammation state. To control this inflammatory response, macrophages use the metabolite itaconate, which can inhibit SDH function and the subsequent proinflammatory response. While M1 cells use aerobic glycolysis, M2 macro-phages use FAO for growth and proliferation. M2 macrophages have roles in the regulation of inflammation and tissue repair and FAO has been directly linked to their antiinflammatory phenotype. Indeed, inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), a rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, limits M2 activation in response to IL-4. CPT1 catalyzes the transfer of long-chain acyl group of the acyl-CoA ester to carnitine, thereby shuttling fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation. Induced changes in macrophage metabolism are IL-4-dependent due to the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 factor and the expression of PGC1β, associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. The fuel for the additional mitochondria is recovered from a futile cycle of CD36-dependent uptake of triglycerides, which increases the spare respiratory capacity (SRC). SRC is the extra capacity available in cells to produce energy in response to increased stress or work. With these examples, we suggest that glycolysis mechanism is observed during development of an inflammatory environment, with polarization toward M1, while the FAO mechanism dominates during development of an anti-inflammatory environment through polarization toward M2 macrophages (Fig 1). However, inhibition of CPT1 has little negative effect on IL-4-induced M2 polarization in humans, suggesting that there is an alternative pathway for M2 development. Fatty acid metabolism is similarly vital for Tm functions and T regulatory differentiation. IL-15, a cytokine that promotes CD8+ Tm cell development and maintenance, promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of CPT1a. Thus, as well as for IL-4 in M2 macrophages, IL-15 increases SRC and oxidative metabolism of CD8 + Tm cells. In contrast, in the plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), FAO is observed during the antiviral response. pDCs are a specialized subset of DCs that release high levels of Type I interferons (IFN-I) in response to infection. Stimulation of pDCs with CpG or recombinant IFN-α upregulates FAO and OXPHOS. Inhibition of CPT1 decreases CpG-induced OXPHOS and the production of IFN-α, TNF, and IL-6 in Pdc. DAMAGE OF MTDNA BY OXPHOS/ROS AND MUTATIONS Under normal conditions, the main source of mtDNA damage is generated by the OXPHOS process that generates ROS. Excess ROS such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals can damage mtDNA directly or serve as precursors of oxidants (such as 4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde, acrolein, and crotonaldehyde) that also induce mtDNA aberrations. ROS and oxidants not only affect DNA structures but also modify essential mitochondrial proteins and lipid membranes (Fig 2). Without external sources of oxidative stress, normal level of OXPHOS and ROS/oxidant generation is counteracted by enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants. The antioxidant system, consisting of a set enzymes and metabolites converting O2●‒ into H2O2 and H2O, is regulated by transcription factors sensitive to the redox state, therefore cells can quickly adapt to moderate oxidative stress. Types of mtDNA damage include single-strain breaks, abasic sites, oxidative base damage, and DNA cross-links. Repairing of abasic sites and oxidized/altered bases may lead to generation of SSBs that lead to stalled or blocked replication and transcription. Blocked replication/transcription processes as well as the double-strand breaks can induce mtDNA degradation. In turn, degradation of the aberrant mtDNA due to the presence of multiple functional mtDNA copies within the cell is a way of preserving mitochondrial genetic material from mutations, in addition to the repair tools. Cells survive and maintain the OXPHOS function with a high mtDNA mutation load: up to 80%−90% of the mtDNA can be mutant, up to 40% can be deleted; when the mutation load is above the threshold mitochondria undergo fragmentation (multiple fission events) and dysfunctional parts are eliminated. The mechanism of mtDNA degradation after severe damage with double-stranded breaks is not mediated by mitochondrial nucleases and is not yet known. Though both mtDNA damage and repair can be sources of mutations, most of the mtDNA mutations that accumulate with age are most likely the result of mitochondrial polymerase POLγ nucleotide misinsertion errors that occur just once per 500,000 nucleotides inserted. Indeed, the ROS/oxidants mostly induce transversion mutations G to T that do not significantly increase with aging, while older people accumulate the transition mtDNA mutations demonstrated by ultrasensitive sequencing analysis of point mutations frequencies in young (<1 yr) and old (>75 yr) individuals. The very high fidelity of POLγ and a small mitochondrial genome size (16,569 base pairs) make mtDNA mutations rare events. Accumulation of exclusively point mutations that cannot affect mitochondrial functions is explained by so-called “purifying selection” through autophagy of dysfunctional mitochondria. TURNOVER OF MITOCHONDRIA Mitochondria biogenesis and quality control. The “quality control of mitochondria” is the balance between several processes that aim to provide the cell with a functional mitochondrial system: mitochondria biogenesis, lysis of dysfunctional proteins, vesicular transport to the lysosomes, mtDNA degradation, fusion and fission, and mitophagy (autophagy of the mitochondria). To accomplish this quality control communication between the mitochondria and nucleus is essential. Mitochondrial biogenesis begins with the activation of signaling cascades and transcriptional complexes that promote the de novo synthesis of mitochondrial proteins and replication of mtDNA, recruitment and transport of the new proteins to mitochondrial compartments, and assembly of expanding mitochondrial structures. Therefore, growth of mitochondrial mass starts from enlargement of mitochondria, which later undergo fission (or division) events increasing the number of mitochondria. Known events that activate mitochondrial biogenesis include the lack of energy sensed as a high ADP/ATP ratio and cell functions activation sensed as the presence of growth factors, increase of cAMP or cytoplasmic Ca2+ ions. All these events are shown to lead to increased activity of PGC1a, with consequent increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus, low levels of ATP lead to increased activity of 5׳-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase AMPK that phosphorylates and activates PGC1α. Though AMPK downregulate functions of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), independent activation of mTOR by growth factors can also increase PGC1α activity. High levels of cAMP activate cAMP response element-binding protein, that inhibits the mitophagy-related LC3-II molecule and upregulates the expression of PGC1α. PGC1α activity also can be upregulated through p38 mitogen-activated kinase and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase activation upon increase of Ca2+ levels. PGC1α regulates major transcription factors regulating biogenesis of mitochondria: nuclear respiratory factors NRF1 and NRF2 (also known as NFE2L2). Both of them upregulate mitochondria-related genes, including proteins providing respiratory function, heme synthesis, mitochondrial transport, tRNA synthesis, ribosomal proteins, etc. Mitochondrial biogenesis is necessarily associated with proper functioning of protein transport complexes, given that more than 90% of these mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus of the cell. For effective protein turnover mitochondria use their separate proteolytic system: protein quality control proteases present in the mitochondrial compartments. Excess unfolded proteins in mitochondria induce the mitochondrial unfolded protein response mtUPR and includes upregulation of the chaperones HSP60, HSP10 and mtDnaJ, and protease ClpP expression in the nucleus, together with upregulation of mitochondrial proteases YME1L1, PMPCB, and other proteins. Outer membrane proteins can be degraded by the proteasome, dysfunctional proteins aggregates on the focal sides of outer membrane can form mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDV) that fuse with lysosomes. Damaged mitochondria can be removed through the acquisition of lysosomal markers or enveloped by autophagosomes via mitophagy. Vesicular transport of the MDVs to the lysosomes is a complimentary tool to the mechanisms of fission and mitophagy, allowing the cell to recycle small portions of mitochondria. The Parkinson’s disease-associated proteins Vps35, Parkin, and putative kinase protein 1 (PINK1) are involved in the biogenesis of a subset of these MDVs, linking this novel trafficking pathway to human disease. A working hypothesis of PINK1/Parkin-mediated MDV formation suggests that unfolded, oxidized proteins within the matrix (triggered by ROS or failure of the protein complex assembly) leads to protein aggregation. As an example, local oxidation of cardiolipin affects import channels and PINK1 accumulates at these failed channels to induce recruitment and activation of Parkin. After that, the ubiquitination activity of Parkin is required for the generation and release of MDVs. Another example of vesicular transport from the mitochondria is the recycling of the protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) after the mitochondria fission/division process. The mitochondria of a cell comprise a dynamic system that undergoes a series of fusion events between individual mitochondria and fission events—separation of mitochondria to smaller organelles. Fusion can help mutated mitochondria to recover the loss of function by utilizing the genetic material of fusion partner. Fission allows the cell to detect dysfunctional parts of mitochondria with low membrane potential, encapsulate, and eliminate them by mitophagy. In mammals mitochondrial fusion is mediated by proteins mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), Mfn2, and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1); Mfn1 and Mfn2 are involved in the merger of the outer membranes, Opa1 is responsible for the merger of inner membranes. Degradation of Mfn1/2, modified by ubiquitination, and cleavage of Opa1 are the factors that prevent fusion. Mitochondrial fission is a result of constriction of the site dividing mitochondria in 2 parts. Initial constriction is mediated by inverted formin 2 inducing polymerization of actin on the endoplasmic reticulum and later ER-mitochondrial interaction. Drp1, a cytosolic protein, is recruited to the mitochondrial membrane in which its conformational change promotes constriction and fission. Recently another protein shown to be a key player in the final fission is dynamin 2. Mitochondrial fission is an intricate process regulating both cellular and organ dynamics, including development, apoptosis, acute organ injury, and various diseases. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission prevents mitophagy, therefore both of these processes are essential for mitochondria quality control. Mitophagy. Mitophagy allows for the constant turn-over of mitochondria and helps to maintain their optimal number or to eliminate them (such as during red blood cell differentiation) and is associated with the elimination of paternal mitochondria after the fusion of a spermatozoon with the oocyte. Mitophagy can be activated via different pathways. One of the best characterized pathways is mediated by 2 key regulators: PTEN-induced PINK1 and Parkin, E3 ubiquitin ligase. Parkin-dependent mitophagy activation. PINK1 is constantly transferred to mitochondria and is constantly transported in the inner membrane by the TOM complex and degraded there by presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein in functional organelles. In unhealthy mitochondria, the inner mitochondrial membrane becomes depolarized. This membrane potential is necessary for the TOM complex mediated protein import and in depolarized mitochondria PINK1 is no longer imported to the inner membrane. PINK1 concentration in the outer mitochondrial membrane increases which lead to autophosphorilation and recruitment of cytosolic Parkin to the mitochondria, where PINK1 phosphorylates the Ubl domain of Parkin which activates its E3 ligase activity. Active Parkin ligates the ubiquitin chains to the mitochondrial outer membrane proteins (tethering itself also), PINK1 phosphorylates them, and this event can cause recruitment of new Parkin molecules (Fig 3). Parkin interacts with the adaptor protein, activating molecule in Beclin-1-regulated autophagy (Ambra1), which activates PI3K next to the mitochondria to assist in mitophagy, but the main role of Parkin in mitophagy activation, remain is formation of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains that promote substrates degradation, amplify the mitophagy activation by serving as the new substrates for PINK1, and together with PINK1, play major effector roles in mitophagy. Mitophagy effector stage. Ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins promote the recruitment of Ub-binding autophagy receptors such as p62 and optineurin, which in turn elicit the targeting of damaged mitochondria to LC3-positive phagophores for clearance in the lysosomes. PINK1 is bound by NDP52 and optineurin that not only interact with LC3, but also recruit autophagy factors ULK1, DFCP1, and WIPI1 to the mitochondria’s focal spots (Fig 3). Parking-independent mitophagy activation. Damaged mitochondria have elevated levels of Fundc1 and Nix on the surface; these proteins can directly recruit LC3-positive phagophores to the mitochondria. Mitochondrial depolarization also triggers ubiquitin ligases Smurf1 and Mul1 that promote mitophagy, presumably ubiquitinating the mitochondrial proteins. Other less studied mechanisms of mitophagy are: Atg-independent mitophagy, Ulk1-dependent and Atg5-independent macroautophagy, autophagy via the 15-lipoxygenase pathway and lysosomal invagination/direct interaction with mitochondria (microautophagy). Interestingly, growing body of evidence has shown the inactivation of Parkin in a broad panel of cancers. Indeed, Parkin has been shown to be downregulated in multiple cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Moreover, Parkin-deficient mice are more susceptible to tumorigenesis and the ectopic expression of Parkin restores normal phenotype suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for Parkin (for detailed review, see). As Parkin is often downregulated in tumors, recently Villa et al identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase (ARIH1/HHARI) that triggers mitophagy in cancer cells in a PINK1-dependent manner. They found that ARIH1/HHARI polyubiquitinates damaged mitochondria, leading to their removal via autophagy. Importantly, ARIH1 is widely expressed in cancer cells, notably in breast and lung adenocarcinomas; ARIH1 expression protects against chemotherapy-induced death. Mitochondria DAMPs and mtDNA mutations in innate and adaptive immunity Immune system constantly detects and destroys the cells that are mutated or transformed, this is what is termed cancer immuno-surveillance. Damage and mutations accumulated in mitochondria can drive both innate and acquired immune responses, thus contributing to immune surveillance. Additionally, mitochondria produce many of the danger-associated molecular patterns, DAMPs, (including mtDNA) therefore mitochondrial functions are linked to regulation of immune responses. Innate immunity. Mitochondrial but not genomic DNA of the tumor cells is found in abundance in the cytosol of tumor-infiltrating DCs. There it can upregulate the cross-priming function of DCs by activating the STING pathway. Lymphocytes (B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells) activated by CpG and non-CpG oligodeoxynucleotides of class C can release extracellular mtDNA; extracellular mtDNA can activate TLR9 or cGAS/STING pathways in the leukocytes and especially neutrophils, inducing proinflammatory and type I IFN responses. Extracellular mtDNA also binds IL-26 and this complex can be taken up by myeloid cells where it activates proinflammatory STING and P2Y1 receptor-cAMP pathways Inside the cells mtDNA released from the mitochondria can activate immune responses interacting with cGAS, TLR9 and inflammasome proteins NOD, LRR, Pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2). Adaptive immunity. Cells with damaged/mutated mitochondria have increased expression of MHC class I that may facilitate exposure of the neoantigens to immune system and clearance of the affected cells. Indeed the mutations of mtDNA are shown to be a possible source of immunogenic self-peptides initiating the T cell-mediated immune responses. Autophagy can produce the antigenic peptides conjugated with both MHCI and MHCII molecules, but antigen presentation mechanisms activated in mitophagy are different. Mitophagy activators PINK1 and Parkin do not activate, but in contrary, suppress mitochondrial antigens presentation (MitAP). This can be explained by PINK1/Par-kin-dependent suppression of MDVs production: the latter provide mitochondrial antigens transport to the lysosomes with consequent presentation of the antigenic peptides in MHC class I complex. Targeting mitochondria for cancer therapy. Mitochondria are responsible for cell energy metabolism, ROS production and induced cell death thus it is not surprising that functional defects can contributes to development and progression of cancer. The recent understanding of the crucial role played by the mitochondria in cancer has led to the development of different therapeutic approaches focused on this organelle. Agents that target this organelle has been extensively studied in the context of cancer. In this section, we discuss some of the most relevant mitochondrial targets in cancer therapy and give a few examples of drugs that are currently being tested in clinical trials. Targeting mitochondria metabolism. Mitochondria are defined as the powerhouse of the cell; they are the major source of ATP, control redox homeostasis, they are involved in oncogenic signaling, innate immunity, and cell death. Under physiological conditions, ATP is synthesized through oxidative phosphorylation by the mitochondria. However, cancer cells switch their energy metabolism into aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon known as the “Warburg effect.” Warburg hypothesized that this metabolic switch was due to defects in mitochondria, however, recent studies show that depleting mitochondria from cancer cells decreases tumor progression. Glucose is one of the main key players in cancer progression and is the promoter of tumor invasion and metastasis and glycolysis is a rapid way to produce ATP supplying ample energy for proliferation of malignant cells. This is likely why in both hypoxic and nonhypoxic conditions; tumor cells utilize glycolysis. Therefore, reversing the hyperglycolytic state of cancer cells in order to induce cell death is a possible therapeutic approach. The first attempt to reduce glycolysis is to block glucose uptake in malignant cells. For example, WZB117 a bis-hydroxybenzoate compound that acts as a fastacting, irreversible blocker of glucose transport by GLUT1, is a drug able to block Glucose Transporter 1 (GLUT1) activity reducing glucose transport inside the cell lowering glycolysis metabolism in the tumor. This effect is mediated by the reduction of ATP levels in the cell and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and eventually cell-cycle arrest. This drug has been tested in combination therapy with either paclitaxel or cisplatin displaying a synergistic effect in vitro and in vivo against lung and breast cancer cell lines. Another drug that is able to decrease glycolysis metabolism in cancer cells is 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG). 2-DG is a glucose analog that competes with glucose-6-phosphate to inhibit glucose metabolism. However, it has been observed that its 2-DG activity is not sufficiently potent to significantly reduce glucose uptake and thus induce cell death. 2-DG showed a significant increase in cytotoxicity of cisplatin in human head and neck cancer by enhancing ROS levels. Two different clinical trials have been performed to test 2-DG anticancer activity. However, there are concerns that 2-DG might compromise the glycolytic metabolism of the brain and of the heart. Another example is Dichloroacetate (DCA) which is a small molecule that inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. DCA is able to revert the hyperglycolytic state of cancer cells to normal glucose oxidation metabolism, in this manner, tumor cells become more sensitive to apoptotic signals and their proliferative capacity is impaired. DCA has been tested as a monotherapy in a Phase I study in patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors. Metformin is a biguanide hypoglycemic oral drug that is currently used to treat type 2 diabetes. Metformin also acts as an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain Complex I and activator of AMP-activated protein kinase, therefore metformin can reduce ATP production. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin to control their blood glucose levels have a reduced risk to develop cancer. Later this drug has been proven effective therapy against cancer in numerous cancer clinical trials on diabetic and nondiabetic cancer patients. Two mechanisms can explain the antitumor activity of metformin. Decreasing blood glucose levels lead to decreased levels of insulin, serving as a mitogen in some cancers. Another mechanism is inhibition of the respiratory complex I by metformin and its analogs. In low glucose availability metformin decreases ATP production and induces cell death; when glucose concentration is high metformin inhibits ATP levels and induces AMPK activation that reduces activity of mTOR necessary for proliferation. Despite the number of clinical trials assessing the positive effect of this drug, results are still to be considered inconclusive. Targeting ROS. Reactive oxygen species are important for the cell to perform normal functions; however, when mitochondrial metabolism is accelerated the result is a dangerous accumulation of ROS that can lead to neoplastic transformation. Mutations in nuclear (nDNA) and mtDNA in cancer cells may affect components of the ETC, leading to an increase of ROS levels. Moreover, malignant cells are able to escape apoptotic signals, thus there is an over-accumulation of ROS that triggers genomic instability and cancer proliferation. Not surprisingly, overproduction of ROS is also considered a hallmark of cancer. Elesclomol sodium (STA-4783) is an example of a drug targeting ROS levels in cancer cells. Its role is to inhibit electron transport flux and enhance ROS production inducing oxidative stress in both transformed and healthy cells. However, as tumor cells have already elevated levels of ROS, this drug will be able to induce cytotoxicity selectively in malignant cells, resulting in activation of apoptotic cell death. STA-4783 alone and in combination with paclitaxel showed promising data in phase I/II clinical studies in patients with refractory solid tumors. However, a phase III study in patients with melanoma has been discontinued for safety reasons. Lastly, β-phenylethylisothiocyanates (PEITC) is a thiol modifier that interacts with ROS regulators. PEITC targets CIII complex decreasing OXPHOS and inducing ROS production to trigger cancer cell apoptosis. PEITC has also been tested in vitro in combination with metformin in ovarian cancer tumors and significant anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effect have been observed. Recently a Phase II clinical trial has been completed in which PEITC was used as a lung cancer-preventing agent in smoking subjects. Targeting the permeability transition pore complex. The permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) is a highly dynamic supramolecular complex found on the mitochondria membrane and is responsible for mitochondria membrane permeabilization. PTPC is composed of different molecular components; voltage-dependent anion channel in the outer membrane, the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in the mitochondrial inner membrane and cyclophilin D in the mitochondrial matrix. Additional PTPC-interacting proteins include the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in the outer membrane and hexokinase (HK), which makes contact with the mitochondrial outer surface from the cytosol. HK is an inhibitor of the mitochondria membrane permeabilization. PTP opening normally occur in dysfunctional mitochondria and its occurrence starts a process that leads to cessation of ATP synthesis, Ca2+ release, inhibition of respiration and, in vitro at least, pyridine nucleotide depletion, matrix swelling, mitochondrial depolarization; mobilization of cytochrome c and eventually release of proapoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c itself, endonuclease G and AIF. To induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, 2 strategies can be utilized: a direct strategy that targets different components of the PTPC using drugs that either increase cytosolic levels of Ca2+ or trigger ROS production; or indirect permeabilization by depletion of endogenous inhibitors of PTCP like glucose, phosphocreatine, and glutathione. The most promising drug targeting ANT that efficiently triggers apoptosis is lonidamine or 1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1-H-indazole-3-carboxylic acid. Lonidamine is an ANT ligand that acts as a HK and induces a conformational change in the ANT leading to mitochondrial channel formation. It has been reported that lonidamine is able to target the respiratory activity of complex II, suppressing the formation of fumarate and malate leading to the accumulation of succinate in the treated cells. Lonidamine enhances the apoptotic response to cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, melphalan, and γ-irradiation both in vivo and in vitro. This drug has been tested in the early phase clinical trials but the study was terminated due to the lack of benefits for the patients. 4-(N-(S-glutathionylacetyl)amino) phenylarsenoxide (GSAO), a glutathione-coupled trivalent arsenical compound, has the ability to cross-link critical cysteine residues of ANT to inhibit the antiporter activity of ATP/ADP, ROS accumulation and cytosolic ATP depletion, mitochondrial depolarization, and apoptosis. GSAO targets preferentially proliferating cells due to the high Ca2+ levels and elevated respiration rates in mitochondria, which make them more susceptible to PTPC. However, a clinical trial on patients with solid tumors did not show any significant effect. PENAO (4-[N-[S-penicillaminylacetyl]amino] phenylarsonous acid) is a second generation ANT inhibitor that accumulates in the tumor cells more rapidly than GSAO, resulting in enhanced antiproliferative activity and increased anti-tumor efficacy in mice. There is currently a Phase Ia clinical trial ongoing using a continuous intravenous infusion of PENAO in patients with solid tumors. Targeting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is the process that mediates intrinsic apoptotic pathway in cells. Apoptosis impairment serves a critical feature of the tumor cells and makes them more chemotherapy resistant. MOMP is one of the most important mechanisms of apoptosis. Restoring normal apoptosis mechanisms in the tumor cells, including mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, is a logical approach to treat cancer. MOMP is under control of the Bcl2 family proteins, this family consists of BH3-only proapoptotic proteins and prosurvival proteins. Major proapoptotic players are Bax and Bak able to form the pores, they can be activated by other proapoptotic proteins of Bcl2 family; prosurvival family members are able to inhibit Bax and Bak. In cancer cells, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL antiapoptotic proteins are overexpressed and able to sequester BAX and BAK, inhibiting cell death. One of the best characterized drugs used to restore MOMP in cancer cells is ABT-737. This molecule binds to BCl-2, BCl-Xl, and BCl-w mimicking BH3-only proteins, antagonists of cell death. The drug induces cell death through the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and depends on expression of the BCl-2 family proteins. ABT-737 has been shown to enhance conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment in hematological and solid tumors. However, ABT-737 has presented delivery problems and moreover, when Mcl-1, another prosurvival relative, is expressed in cancer cells, this drug encounters resistance due to its inability to bind Mcl-1. An orally available derivative is known as ABT-263 (Navitoclax). Its activity has been observed in SCLC xenografts and in combination with chemotherapy agents this drug is in preclinical studies and phase I studies in B cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and SCLC. However, Phase II clinical trials showed a limited efficacy of this drug against advanced and recurrent SCLC. Gossypol (AT-101) is a natural phenolic compound that can simultaneously inhibit BCl-2, BCl-Xl, BlC-w, and MCl1. It has been reported to be active against prostate cancer in a Phase I/II clinical trials. Phase II clinical trial has just been completed to treat patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Apogossypol (NSC736630) is a semisynthetic advanced version of gossypol with superior antitumor activity and reduced toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Mitochondria drug delivery strategy. The challenge that comes with the development of mitochondria-targeting drugs involves the necessity to generate an appropriate way to deliver the desired molecule to its intended target. Different strategies have already been assessed; delocalized lipophilic cations are attracted by the negatively charged mitochondria matrix and thus are able to cross the membrane and accumulate within the mitochondria. The only concern when this delocalized lipophilic cations are used to deliver drugs to the mitochondria is that they can be toxic for the organelle when accumulated in high concentration also in normal tissues. Another strategy that has been considered is mitochondria targeting sequence (MTS)-containing peptides. They are nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins that contain an MTS of 20–40 amino acids recognized by receptors on the mitochondrial membrane. This delivery approach has been successfully used to transport chemical cargos to the mitochondria, however, the size and the solubility of MTS is a major limitation for this approach. Synthetic peptides and amino-acid-based transporters have been recently evaluated as an alternative drug delivery method. Lastly, vesicle-based carriers have been considered to bring large or impermeable cargos to the mitochondria. These strategies and many others have already been extensively discussed in the literature. Mitochondria and new approaches to cancer immunotherapy. The ability of the adaptive immune system to distinguish self from nonself is established during central tolerance development, during which time self-reactive clones of T and B cells are either eliminated or develop as immune regulatory cells. Other positively selected surviving cells recognize non‒self-entities, notably infectious agents and cancerous tissues that display mutated proteins, promising active immunotherapy approaches including cancer vaccines such as dendritic cell therapy and peptide vaccination, are as effective as the Tumor Associated Antigens (TAA) these vaccines target. Potential TAA selection for active or passive immunotherapy strategies such as vaccine and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy respectively, must meet a number of criteria. They must be immunogenic, abundantly expressed by tumor cells, not be expressed in normal tissue (to limit off-target effects) and (preferably) functionally important for the tumor (so that expression is unlikely to be lost). Chen et al suggested that somatically mutated self-proteins are involved in autoimmune disease development. To demonstrate their hypothesis, PBMCs were collected from healthy donors and autoimmune patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or ankylosing spondylitis, T cells were stimulated with either mitochondrial self-peptides or mitochondria-mutated peptides; T cells activated by the mutated self-peptide were cross-reactive with the self-peptide both in healthy and autoimmune patients as measured by IFNγ levels. This study suggests that somatic mutations may participate in the induction of autoimmune diseases by antigen presentation. Interestingly, many different types of cancers harbor somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations and consequently an increased immune response has been observed against mutated mitochondrial peptides; for example, mitochondrial cytochrome b peptide derived from melanoma cells of patients is recognized by CD4+ T cells. Mitochondrial antigen presentation has been proposed as a possible cause for autoimmune disease development. In 2016, Matheoud et al published a study in which they show how Pink1 and Parkin proteins are involved in adaptive immune responses and suggested the possibility of autoimmune mechanisms involved in Parkinson disease (PD) antigen presentation. Parkin is one of the most important players in the development of PD; this protein is an E3 ubiquitinase that is able to mediate mitophagy in conditions of stress or damage of the mitochondria. Parkin is activated by phosphorylation by Pink1, an outer membrane mitochondrial surface protein. In PD, Parkin is mutated and subsequently, Pink1 is impaired in the activation of Parkin ubiquitinase functions. The loss of Pink1/Parkin activity leads to a significant reduction of mitophagy. Interestingly, Matheoud et al observed that mitAP is enhanced in PD, likely as a response to the downregulation of mitophagy. MitAP relies on mitochondrial-derived vesicles which are able to transport the damaged mitochondria to late endosomes where peptides are loaded on MHC I molecule and presented on the surface of the cell. The conclusion that was proposed is that Parkin and Pink1 are able to inhibit the immune response in PD. This new finding may be the first step to link a neurodegenerative disease like PD to autoimmunity. Moreover, Voo et al provided the first example of a mitochondrial immune target for CD4+ T cells expanded from a melanoma patient. The tumor infiltrating T cells expanded, by high dose IL-2 from such patient, demonstrated recognition of a peptide translated from an alternative open reading frame of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b). With these studies providing the sound rationale that cancer patients bearing mutations in mitochondrial DNA and tumor-associated mitochondrial antigens (TAMAs) meet all of the criteria of an ideal TAA. Pierini et al developed a cancer vaccine based on using aberrant mitochondrial protein, isolated from the tumor, as an immunotherapeutic strategy. Syngeneic dendritic cells were pulsed with enriched mitochondrial protein extract derived from the RENCA cancer cell line or solid tumors and then administered in vivo to determine the vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Upon vaccine administration followed by tumor challenge (prophylactically), the vaccine rejected tumors in 70%−80% of the animals and delayed tumor growth in the remaining in a CD8+ cytotoxic T cell-specific manner. In a therapeutic setting, mice were challenged initially with tumor followed by administration of the TAMAs-based vaccine and similarly, tumor delay was observed. Subsequently, sequencing of the RENCA mtDNA found 2 mutated proteins (COX1 and ND5) which were then used to produce a tumor mitochondria vaccine. COX1 mutated peptide used as a vaccine resulted in delayed tumor growth and induction of T cell specific immune response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first vaccine based on mtDNA-mutated peptides derived from tumor cells that elicit an immune response specifically against the tumor.",7599
31484668,"The role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in cancer has been the focus of extensive study over the years. The Warburg effect, characterized by a preference for glycolysis, suggests that cancer cells become unreliant on oxidative phosphorylation for the generation of ATP. Given that the activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is required for the generation of pyrimidines, which are essential for the growth of rapidly dividing cells, a complete lack of ETC activity is incompatible with the growth of cancer. Compelling evidence for the necessity of mitochondria in tumor formation was provided by studies in which tumor cells depleted of mtDNA and engrafted in mice, only formed tumors after acquiring host mtDNA via whole mitochondria transfer. Using similar experimental systems, it was recently demonstrated that the acquisition of mitochondria by mtDNA depleted tumors cells is dependent on the acquisition of OXPHOS for pyrimidine synthesis, not ATP generation. Acquisition of mtDNA through exosomes or whole organelle transfer has also been shown as a resistance mechanism by breast, blood, and brain tumors in response to targeted, systemic, or radiotherapy. Further, the confusing nature of the role of mtDNA in cancer biology is in part due to the complexity of its genetics. As a result of their bacterial origin, the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells contain their own circular genome. In humans, mtDNA is 16.5 kb in length and encodes 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and 13 proteins. These proteins encode core subunits of complexes I, III, IV, and V of the ETC. The mitochondrial genome is found in multiple copies per mitochondrion and thereby hundreds to thousands of copies per cell. The numerous copies of mtDNA per cell confer mitochondrial genetics with a level of complexity that requires specialized nomenclature. Specifically, homoplasmy denotes when the same sequence of mtDNA is present in all strains of mtDNA in a cell. In contrast, heteroplasmy, refers to a state in which mixed mtDNA sequences or mutations are present. Heteroplasmy at a specific locus is defined as a percentage of abundance relative to the wild type sequence (Cambridge reference mitochondria sequence). The genetics of mtDNA are further complicated by the fact that mitochondria are dependent on genes encoded by the nuclear genome for their function. Many subunits of the ETC are encoded in the nuclear genome. Additionally, proteins necessary for the maintenance, replication, and transcription of the mitochondrial genome are encoded by the nuclear DNA. For example, transcription of the mitochondrial genome is dependent on POLRMT, a nuclear encoded polymerase found on chromosome 19. In fact, ~99% of the mitochondrial proteome is encoded by nuclear genes. To demonstrate the influence of the mitochondrial genome alone on a given process, it must be experimentally separated from the effect of the nuclear genome. However, the mitochondrial genome has proved difficult to edit genetically despite advanced using nucleases such as mitochondrial zinc finger nucleases (mtZFN) and mitochondrially targeted transcription activator-like effector nucleases (mitoTALENs). The current inability to effectively deliver exogenous RNA into mitochondria has prevented mtDNA engineering from benefiting from the CRISPR revolution. Many in the field are actively trying to adapt the CRISPR/Cas9 system for mtDNA editing with focus on the introduction of gRNAs into the mitochondria. Further development of the molecular toolkit to edit the mitochondrial genome has the potential to transform our understanding of mtDNA and the therapeutic interventions against mitochondrial diseases. Cybrids as a tool to test the role of mtDNA in cancer The challenges in manipulating mtDNA with the traditional approaches of molecular biology has led to the development of transmitochondrial cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) technology. This technique relies on the generation of ρ0 cells devoid of mtDNA by prolonged culture with ethidium bromide (Fig. 1A). The resulting cells serve as the donor of the nuclear genome. Donor cells of mtDNA are enucleated and the fusion of both creates cybrids with the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of experimental interest (Fig. 1A). Using cybrids, the Hayashi group was the first to demonstrate that mtDNA alone could impact the metastatic behavior of cells. In this seminal work, cybrids were generated between non-metastatic P29 and highly metastatic A11 murine cancer cells. In tail vein injections and spontaneous metastasis assays, highly metastatic A11 mtDNA imparted a metastatic phenotype in cybrids with P29 nuclei. Conversely, non metastatic P29 mtDNA blunted the metastatic nature of A11 nuclei. The authors ascribed this effect to mutations in ND6 (G13997A and 13885insC) present in the mitochondrial genome of A11 cells. However, while frameshift and missense mutations represent a possible mechansim to explain this phenotype, additional differences in the mitochondrial genomes of the two cells cannot be excluded. Following this original study, multiple others followed, providing countless examples of the effect of mtDNA on invasion and metastasis. Cybrids generated between invasive triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and fetal fibroblasts showed that the mtDNA of MDA-MB-231 confers metastasis. The authors postulated that the metastatic conferring capacity of MDA-MB-231 mtDNA is due to pathogenic mutations in ND4 (C12084T) and ND5 (A13966G). Cybrids with the mtDNA of MDA-MB-435 cells, which carry a pathogenic A12308G mutation in the tRNALeu(CUN) gene, were also shown to promote metastasis in vivo. Patient derived mtDNA with an A3243T mutation in tRNALeu(UUR) conferred invasive and metastatic properties to 143 osteosarcoma cells. Cybrids of A549 cells paired with the mtDNA of lung adenocarcinoma patients with missense and nonsense mutations in ND6, also showed enhanced invasion, migration, and mitochondrial superoxide production. In addition, mtDNA of highly metastatic B82M fibrosarcoma containing a ND6 13885insC mutation conferred cybrids with metastatic capacity in vivo. In this study, mtDNA sequencing of NADH dehydrogenase (ND) genes in 115 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) identified 14 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) computationally predicted to decrease complex I function. These SNVs in ND genes were significantly more abundant in patients with distant metastasis, providing evidence that mtDNA mutations are associated with metastatsis. Further supporting a mechanistic link between complex I function and metastasis, is the observation that manipulation of complex I activity by subunit overexpression or knockdown affected metastsis in vivo. Since the majority of proteins encoded in mtDNA are subunits of complex I, a large portion of the mitochondrial genome affects complex I function. Using cybrids, it was demonstrated that mild mutations in complex I (G3460A in ND1, G11778A in ND4, and T14484C in ND6) conferred enhanced tumorgenicity in nude mice compared to parental cells. Cybrids with the G8363A mutation tRNALys, a rare and severe mtDNA mutation clinically implicated in Leigh syndrome, cardiomyopathy, and MERRF-like syndrome, were also generated. Interestingly, of all ten cybrids and cell lines generated in this study, G8363A tRNALys cybrids had the highest levels of mitochondrial superoxide but were not tumorigenic in nude mice. These data suggest that mild mtDNA mutations may be more potent cancer drivers than severe mtDNA mutations. One potential explanation for these observations is that on one hand, severe mtDNA mutations may compromise mitochondrial function to an extent that is incompatible with tumor formation. Milder mtDNA mutations, on the other hand, do not severely compromise mitochondrial function but still result in elevated ROS, which act as a pro-tumorigenic signaling molecule. Clinical evidence supporting a role of mtDNA in cancer In addition to studies using cybrids, clinical evidence further supports the influence of mtDNA mutations on cancer etiology and progression. In a cohort of 1,675 tumor samples across 30 different cancer types, 1,907 somatic mtDNA substitutions were identified. Similarly, somatic mtDNA mutations were found in approximately three quarters of a cohort of breast cancer patients. The majority of mutations described in these patients were found in genes encoding subunits of complex I. In renal oncocytoma patients, loss of function mtDNA mutation of complex I was identified as a driver event that proceeds chromosome 1 loss and cyclin D1 overexpression. In response to complex I mtDNA mutations, cancer cells of these patients showed adaptive upregulation of glutathione biosynthesis. This metabolic rewiring may function to enhance oxidative stress capacity. The compensatory changes of nuclear gene expression in response to mtDNA mutation highlight the cross talk between the mitochondria and the nucleus. Using RNA sequencing data from 344 patients with breast cancer, some of whom had patient matched normal samples, 9,063 SNVs and 84 insertions or deletions (INDELs) were detected in tumor mtDNA. Of the identified somatic variants/mutations, 95% were typical of replication-coupled mtDNA substitutions. Further, the number of identified mtDNA variants/mutations was signficantly correlated with the age of patients, suggesting that replication induced mtDNA changes that accumulate with age are largely repsonsible for the mtDNA landscapes seen in breast cancer patients. In diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, tumor-normal pairs identified private constitutional variants and somatic mtDNA mutations in a mutational spectrum consistent with the replication associated mode of mutagenesis. In a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines, mtDNA mutations were found in 70% of samples. The majority of these somatic mutations were homoplasmic and were transtitions at purines, the preffered target of free radicals, indicating ROS induced mtDNA mutation. Therefore, oxidation and replication induced mutagensis may be considered to be the two main sources of mtDNA damage. Using whole-genome sequencing of 1,916 patients with matched normal and tumor samples across 24 different cancer types, a study identified distinct mutational patterns present in the mitochondrial genomes of tumor cells. This study identified 2,350 tumor-specific somatic mtDNA mutations present across both the coding and non-coding regions of the mitochondrial genome, though the majority resided in RNA coding regions. When metastatic or recurrent tumor samples were compared to primary tumors, there was a significant increase in the proportion of mutations residing in RNA encoding regions of the genome (91% metastatic, 96% recurrent, 87% primary). These data suggest a selection for mtDNA mutations in coding regions of the mitochondrial genome in cancer progression. Tumor specific mtDNA mutations were observed across all electron transport chain complexes, but a significant proportion of these mutations were found in genes encoding subunits of Complex I. Interestingly, several of these mutations in complex I were recurrent or mutually exclusive, suggesting certain mutations provide an adaptive advantage that promotes tumorigenesis. Analysis of the mitochondrial genomes of normal samples in this study identified 1,154 normal-cell heteroplasmies. The identified heteroplasmic sequences were found throughout the mitochondrial genome but the vast majority of the variants/mutations described were in the non-coding D-Loop, which is important for mtDNA replication and transcription. Compared to tumor specific mtDNA mutations, normal cell heteroplasmies were significantly less abundant in RNA encoding regions of the mitochondrial genome (69% normal, 87% primary tumor). Further, tumor mtDNA had significantly more nonsense mutations, missense mutations, insertions, and deletions than normal cells. Additional insight into the changes in the mitochondrial genomes of cancer cells during metastatic progression is gained from a rapid autopsy study of 10 prostate cancer patients with primary tumors, soft tissue metastases, bone metastases, and normal tissue analyzed by mtDNA sequencing. This study found that bone metastases had significantly more somatic mtDNA mutations than both the primary tumor and soft tissue metastases. In 70% of patients, a G10398A missense mutation in the ND3 gene of complex I was found exclusively in bone metastases. This observation argues that specific mtDNA mutations provide an adaptive advantage to form secondary lesions in particular target organs. In a epidemiological study, the 10398A allele was found to be an independent risk factor for invasive breast cancer in African-American but not Caucasian women. Significant increased risk of breast cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus was also seen with the 10398A in an Indian cohort with the mtDNA haplogroup N. Further studies using cybrids generated with the mtDNA of African Americans show that cells with the 10398A allele have resistance to apoptosis, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS production, enhanced colony formation capacity, and increased metastatic capacity in tail vein injection experiments. These data suggest that specific mtDNA mutations can significantly modulate cellular phenotypes resulting in enhanced tumorgenicity and disease progression. Other reviews discussing the influence of mtDNA in cancer provide further insight into the well-established, albeit confusing nature of this phenomenon. Are mitochondrial unfolded protein response activating-mtDNA landscapes rather than individual mtDNA mutations the answer? Our group recently performed mitchondrial DNA sequencing in order to determine whether common mtDNA mutations can distinguish invasive from non-invasive breast cancer cell lines. Specific missense mutations, A8860G in ATP8 and A15380G in CYB, were present in all cell lines at homoplasmic levels. However, no common mutations were exclusively seen in invasive cell lines. Additionally, neither the number nor location of mtDNA mutations/variations idenitfied invasive from non-invasive cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found that the only commonality in the mtDNA of invasive cells was the presence of at least one varaiant with high levels of heteroplasmy. As our laboratory has a long-standing interest in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), we hypothesized that perhaps the mtDNA mutational landscape of invasive cells differentially activates this pathway. The UPRmt is a multibranched signaling pathway that promotes mitochondrial fitness through induction of nuclear encoded protein quality control programs, antioxidant machinery, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitophagy and is activated by perturbations to mitochondrial homeostasis. Similarly, others have postulated that the ability of mtDNA mutations to promote cancer initiation and progression is mediated through adaptive nuclear gene expression patterns, as reviewed elsewhere in detail. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that activation of the UPRmt was a defining characteristic of invasive cell lines and inhibition of the UPRmt abolished invasion. Importantly, this observation was confirmed using a set of 143B/206 osteosarcoma cybrids and hybrids in which the mtDNA of CyB or COX1 cybrids was fused with mtDNA of another patient were also used in this study. mtDNA sequencing of cybrids and their respective hybrids reveleaded minor differences in heteroplasmy within the pairs. Despite sharing the same nuclear genome and having the same mtDNA mutation as their respective cybrid, both hybrid cells were significantly less invasvive and showed reduced activation of the UPRmt. These results suggest that the effects of a given ROS-generating mutation on UPRmt activation and invasion is dependent on the surrounding mtDNA lanscape in which it resides. This observation is consisent with the finding that the 10398A allele described above is only associated with cancer in certain ethnic groups. Human populations are characterized by mtDNA haplotypes which mirror our evolution out of Africa. A result of sequential accumulation of mtDNA variants through maternal lineage, these haplotypes differ in polymorphisms across the mitochondrial genome. The ethnic differences in the effect of a given mtDNA mutant on clinical phenotypes is a result of the mtDNA haplotype in which that mutation residues. The ability of mtDNA haplotype to influence cancer behavior is highlighted by a number of clinical studies. Patients with mtDNA haplotype M exhibited significant increased risk of breast cancer, with M sub-haplotype D5 having the most pronounced risk. Interestingly, despite increased breast cancer incidence, haplotype M had significantly lower rates of metastasis than haplotype N. This study also reported a significant increased risk of thyroid cancer in haplotype D4a. In hepatocellular carcinoma patients, polymorphisms in the D-Loop (315insC and 16263T) were independent predictors of increased tumor-free survival. In gastric cancer, mtDNA haplotype N is associated with better survival. In gastoenteropancreatic neuroendocine neoplasm patients, three SNVs in the D-Loop were significant predictors of survival with 16257A, 150T, and 151T alleles doing worse. It is not yet known how these alleles affect nuclear gene expression in these cancer types. It is likely, however that these alleles modulate nuclear gene expression. In an elegant study utilizing nuclear matched cybrids with different levels of heteroplasmy of a single mtDNA tRNALEU 3242A>G, it was demonstrated that nuclear gene expression was significnatly affected in phases corresponding to the heteroplasmic levels of the point mutant. These studies highlight the ability of mtDNA landscapes to infuence clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Collectively, this body of work suggests that mild differences in mtDNA landscapces can modulate the effect of specific mtDNA mutations. Mimicking the effect of haplotype using mice with mtDNA from different genetic backgrounds One of the most significant advances in dissecting the effect of mtDNA in cancer has arisen from the generation of mitochondrial-nuclear exchange (MNX) mice. Using pronuclear exchange, MNX mice are generated with the nuclear genome of an inbred mouse strain in the background of mtDNA from other inbred mouse strains (Fig. 1B). When crossed to mammary specific oncogenic drivers, MNX mice with FVB/NJ nuclear DNA and BALB/cJ or C57BL/6J mtDNA had significantly different tumor latency, metastatic tumor size, and metastatic tumor burden in comparison to wildtype FVB/NJ strain mice. mtDNA backgrounds also significantly affected spontaneous tumor formation in aged mice of 9 different MNX strains. Genomic analyses of MNX mice generated with different mito/nuclear pairings from FVB/NJ, C3H/HeN, C57BL/6J, and BALB/cJ mice also revealed selective differential DNA methylation and nuclear gene expression in strains with identical nuclear genomes but differing mtDNA. The observed epigenetic and transcriptional changes in MNX mice highlight the ability of mtDNA to influence nuclear gene expression. Considering the crosstalk between UPRmt activation and chromatin and epigenetic modification, it is possible that the UPRmt may underlie the reported changes in MNX mice. At the same time, activation of the UPRmt in the absence of underlying pathology prolongs lifespan and delays the onset of age related diseases. To reconcile the pro-longevity effect of the UPRmt and its potential ability to promote tumor progression, we hypothesize the following. In the setting of spontaneous tumor formation, MNX mice carrying mtDNA landscapes that activate the UPRmt may show a delay in aging and age related diseases, such as primary tumor formation. Once a tumor is established, however, activation of the UPRmt may inadvertently promote tumor progression, since the same beneficial effect of the UPRmt that confers longevity, may be highjacked by cancer cells to promote their growth and survival. Additional in vivo evidence of the ability of mtDNA to influence nuclear gene expression and complex disease phenotypes like aging and cancer have emerged from conplastic mice. Taking advantage of the maternal inhertiance of mtDNA, conplastic mice are generated by crossing female mice with a mitochondrial genome of interest to male mice with the nuclear genome of interest. Female offspring are continually backcrossed to male mice with nuclear genome of interest for a minimum of ten generations to create conplastic mice with mtDNA and nuclear DNA of interest (Fig. 1C). Conplastic mice with C57BL/6 nuclear genomes paired with C57BL/6 mitochondria (BL/6C57) or NZB/OlaHsd mitochondria (BL/6NZB) were used in a comprehensive study of healthspan. While the divergence of mtDNA genome between these mice is comparable to that seen between Eurasian and African human mitochondrial genomes, the authors found that BL/6NZB mice had a significant extension in median but not maximal lifespan. Interestingly, analysis of mitochondrial ROS between conplastic strains at a young age showed that BL/6NZB actually had higher levels. However, in older BL/6NZB mice, there was no age-related increase in ROS as seen in BL/6C57 mice. The observation that younger BL/6NZB mice have higher ROS levels than BL/6C57 is seemingly at odds with their more youthful aging profile. This observation, however, is consistent with the phenonemon of mitohormesis which has been shown to promote health and longevity in model organisms. The findings from MNX and conplastic mice and the studies describing the influence of human mtDNA haplotype suggest that different haplotypes have different susceptibilities to cancer. Mitohormesis regulates cancer metastasis Mitohormesis describes the paradoxical effect of moderate mitochondrial stress that activates persistent cytoprotective mechanisms and results in enhanced mitochondrial stress resistance. Mitochondrial ROS has been demonstrated to be an important inducer of mitohormesis and promote longevity and healthspan in C. elegans and yeast. The UPRmt is a key effector pathway of mitohormesis and is necessary for longevity induction by mitohormesis in worms and flies (Figure 2A, 2B). One possible consequence of increased ROS levels at young age in BL/6NZB mice is induction of mitohormesis and activation the UPRmt. In this scenario, mitohormetic activation of the UPRmt would protect against subsequent age related increases in ROS. However, while mitohormesis has been most extensively studied in lower model organisms such as flies, worms, and yeast, only recently has mitohormesis been demonstrated in mice. Most notably, the Shadel group generated an inducible and reversible SOD2 knockdown mouse (iSOD2-KD), and showed that mitohormesis is induced in mice by transient SOD2 knockdown during embryogenic development. Upon SOD2 knockdown, embryos experienced significantly more oxidative stress, which led to induction of mitohormesis that persisted when SOD2 knockdown was reversed. Mitohormetically primed mice were characterized by enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulation of antioxidant defenses, and reduced ROS. Significant overlap was seen between the signature of these mice and the mitoprotective outcomes of UPRmt activation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that mitohormesis does in fact occur in mammals and has profound implications for health and age-related diseases. Additionally, these studies implicate ROS and the UPRmt as important components of mitohormetic signaling in mammals. Given our interest in the UPRmt and cancer, we recently tested whether mitohormesis occurred in tumors and if so whether mitohormesis influences phenotypic cancer cell behavior or disease progression. Having demonstrated that activation of the UPRmt promotes invasion of cancer cells, we hypothesized that mitohormetic activation of the UPRmt may serve to promote tumor metastasis and disease progression. To test these hypotheses, the murine breast cancer model (MMTV-rtTA/NeuNT) was used. We found that primary tumors contain two sub-populations of cancer cells based on mitochondrial ROS levels. We isolated these two sub-populations and found that the ROS+ population is significantly more invasive in vitro and metastatic in vivo. The ROS+ population of cancer cells had significant activation of the UPRmt (Fig. 2B, 2C). Consistent with mitohormesis, basal activation of the UPRmt persisted in ROS+ cells and these cells were resistant to subsequent oxidative stress. These data suggest that oxidative stress in the primary tumor primes a subpopulation of cancer cells to upregulate the UPRmt through mitohormetic signaling. As a result, these cells are more invasive and metastatic. These observations were further validated in human breast cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, we showed that UPRmt activation was sufficient to promote invasion and that the SIRT3 axis of the UPRmt was necessary for invasion and metastasis. This axis of the UPRmt, mediated by the mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT3, is responsible induction of antioxidant programs, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitophagy (Fig. 2A). In this study, genetic knockdown of SIRT3 inhibited invasion and metastasis in in vitro and in vivo model systems. Using a 7-gene signature of the UPRmt we found that patients with UPRmt-HIGH tumors show significantly worse clinical outcomes including metastasis. Importantly, UPRmt-HIGH patients had gene expression programs consistent with mitohormesis. Collectively, these studies indicate that while mitohormesis promotes health and longevity in the absence of underlying pathology, it is perniciously used by cancer cells to promote tumor progression. SOD1 as an additional key mediator of the UPRmt Given the role of ROS in activation of mitohormesis and the UPRmt, we have shown that superoxide dismutases, SOD1 and SOD2, are upregulated by the UPRmt. The mitochondrial matrix localized SOD2 is part of the SIRT3 axis of the UPRmt and plays an important role in mitochondrial antioxidant capacity (Fig. 2A). The cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial intermembrane space localized SOD1 is upregulated by mitochondrial stress and is part of the UPRmt, though which axis it belongs to is currently unknown (Fig. 2A). In the context of cancer, SOD2 is initially downregulated upon tumor initiation and re-activated later during cancer progression and metastasis by the SIRT3 axis of the UPRmt. We previously proposed a SOD2 to SOD1 switch during tumor initiation. We found that SOD1 levels are increased in breast cancer cells with decreased SOD2 levels. We showed that the majority of the superoxide activity in a panel of breast cancer cell lines is due to SOD1 activity. In addition, we found that the mitochondrial fraction of SOD1 is increased in breast cancer cells. Moreover, inhibition of SOD1 led to a selective increase in mitochondrial superoxide levels in cancer cells compared to the normal mammary epithelial cells MCF10A. SOD1 inhibition also led to an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation and altered mitochondrial morphology. These findings suggest that SOD1 is essential for mitochondrial integrity in the presence of increased oxidative stress in cancer cells. We recently sought to better understand the role of SOD1 in cancer. To test the role of SOD1 in vivo, we crossed the SOD1 knockout mice with the inducible ErbB2 and Wnt transgenic models of mammary tumors. We found that in both models, SOD1 is necessary for oncogene-driven proliferation (Fig. 2D). Congruent with our previous findings that SOD1 inhibition does not affect normal mammary epithelial cells in vitro, we found that absence of SOD1 did not affect normal proliferation during different stages of mammary gland development in vivo. Additionally, SOD1 knockout mice do not have any phenotypic differences in other proliferative tissues such as the skin or the intestine. We hypothesized that the specific requirement for SOD1 in cancer cells but not normal highly proliferative tissues may be due to differences in mitochondrial superoxide levels. We found that the proliferation driven by pregnancy does not increase the level of mitochondrial superoxide, while tumors exhibit remarkably high levels of mitochondrial superoxide, and the high ROS sub-population from tumors show higher expression of SOD1. This correlated with SOD1 immunohistochemistry staining in which SOD1 was not detected in normal mammary ducts or proliferating mammary glands during pregnancy but was detected in tumors. Our results suggest that in the absence of SOD1, malignant cells are unable to cope with elevated superoxide levels associated with transformation and undergo oncogene-induced senescence and apoptosis. In addition, breast cancer patients with high SOD1 levels have poor clinical outcomes. Our findings concur with other groups that have demonstrated the efficacy of inhibiting SOD1. One of the first studies linking SOD1 to cancer demonstrated that SOD1 is important for the viability of leukemia cells. Following this finding, the Varmus group identified SOD1 as a selective therapeutic target in a high throughput small molecules screen of approximately 200,000 compounds in human lung adenocarcinomas. Their top small molecule, LCS-1 showed efficacy at killing only lung cancer cells, and had no effect on normal lung epithelial cells in vitro. We have shown that LCS-1 treatment also selectively inhibits the growth of mammary tumor cells . LCS-1 has also been tested in a model of neck and head cancer. Previously, SOD1 has also been pharmacologically inhibited with copper chelators, such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) and tetrathiomolybdate (TM). ATN-224, a TM derivative, and was shown to have efficacy in promoting cell death in lung cancer cells lines and an experimental model of non-small cell lung cancer. Collectively, these studies suggest that SOD1 is vital for cancer cells and may be a potential, selective therapeutic target.",4428
26230693,"1. Introduction Despite enormous investments in the areas of basic research and medical science during the past few decades, cancer remains a leading health threat worldwide. Today in the United States alone, it is estimated that one in four adult men and one in five adult women are at risk of dying from cancer. A resurgence of interest in the study of mitochondria has led to the discovery of several notable differences in the structure and function of this organelle between normal and cancer cells, and various attempts have been made to exploit these differences as novel and site specific targets for chemotherapy. Although a number of mitochondria-targeted compounds have shown some efficacy in selective cancer cell killing in pre-clinical and early clinical testing, the success of mitochondria-targeted therapeutic agents as a single modality treatment option for human cancers has been quite limited. This article presents an overview of mitochondria structure and function, especially as it relates to those differences found between normal and cancer cells, and highlights the progress made in exploiting this organelle as a target for chemotherapy. In addition, it summarizes three alternative treatment strategies that enhance the efficacy and selectivity of mitochondria-targeted anticancer agents in vitro and in vivo and offer the promise of therapeutic benefit. These include: mitochondria-targeted drug delivery systems; photodynamic therapy; and combination chemotherapy. 2. Mitochondria Structure and Function In living cells, mitochondria are dynamic organelles comprising a network of long, filamentous structures that can be seen extending, contracting, fragmenting and fusing with one another as they move in three dimensions throughout the cytoplasm. In electron micrographs of fixed tissue specimens, mitochondria appear as oval shaped particles similar in size to the bacterium Escherichia coli (1–2 microns long × 0.5–1.0 microns wide) and bound by two membranes. The outer membrane encloses the entire contents of the organelle. The inner membrane, which folds inward to form cristae, encloses the inner space, or matrix. Interestingly, the surface area of the inner mitochondrial membrane correlates with the degree of metabolic activity of the cell, and can vary considerably from cell type to cell type, or within a given cell depending upon its functional state. Mitochondria contain the enzymes and cofactors involved in a number of important metabolic reactions and pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid degradation, the urea cycle, and gluconeogenesis. In mammalian cells, the matrix also typically contains up to 10,000 copies of a 16.6 kb closed circular double helical molecule of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is compacted in vivo to form a nucleoprotein complex, or nucleoid. Although representing less than 1% of the total cellular DNA, mtDNA encodes two rRNAs, twenty-two tRNAs and thirteen highly hydrophobic polypeptide subunit components of four different respiratory enzyme Complexes (I, III, IV and V) that are localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria are considered the “powerhouse” of eukaryotic cells because of their central role in the process of aerobic metabolism. In carbohydrate metabolism, this begins when pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, is transported from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix to undergo oxidative decarboxylation via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. In lipid metabolism, this begins when fatty acids are transported into the mitochondrial matrix to undergo sequential rounds of oxidative decarboxylation via the β-oxidation pathway. In either case, the resultant metabolic product is acetyl coA, which is further oxidized in the mitochondrial matrix via the TCA cycle. The net metabolic yield of the TCA cycle includes two molecules of CO2, one molecule of GTP (the energetic equivalent of ATP), three molecules of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and one molecule of reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). NADH and FADH2 go on to serve as respiratory substrates for oxidative phosphorylation, which couples the oxidation of these high-energy electron donors to the synthesis of ATP. In this process, electrons are transferred from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen via four multi-subunit electron transfer complexes located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Complexes I, III and IV of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain assemble into functional supramolecular complexes, called respirasomes. These three respiratory complexes also serve as proton pumps at which the energy derived from the transfer of electrons down the electron transport chain (ETC) is coupled to the translocation of protons from the matrix space outward to the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (i.e., inter-membrane space). Under normal physiological conditions, the inner mitochondrial membrane is relatively impermeable to the backflow of protons and an electrochemical gradient is established across the membrane. The energy stored in this proton gradient, the proton-motive force, is then used to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi via the inner membrane bound enzyme, mitochondrial ATP sythetase (Complex V). Oxidative phosphorylation supplies the vast majority of ATP produced by a cell under aerobic conditions. Mitochondria are the main intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in most tissues. It has been estimated that under physiological conditions, 1%–2% of the molecular oxygen consumed is converted to ROS molecules as a byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation. ROS production can occur when a small fraction of reducing equivalents from Complex I or Complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain “leak” electrons directly to molecular oxygen, generating the superoxide anion O2−. Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase converts O2− to H2O2, which can then acquire an additional electron from a reduced transition metal to generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical ˙OH. There is increasing evidence that Complex II can also be a major regulator of mitochondrial ROS production under physiological and pathophysiological circumstances. ROS play an important role as signaling molecules that mediate changes in cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene transcription. Uncontrolled ROS activity, or oxidative stress, can damage intracellular protein and lipid components, and affect the integrity of biological membranes. High levels of ROS can also damage both nuclear and mtDNA. The mitochondrial genome is especially susceptible to ROS damage due to its proximity to the site of ROS production (i.e., the ETC), as well as the fact that it has no introns or protective histones and a limited capacity for DNA repair. Thus, oxidative stress can impair mitochondrial function directly at the level of mitochondrial enzyme complexes, or as a consequence of its genotoxicity to mtDNA. Severe or prolonged oxidative stress can lead to irreversible oxidative damage and cell death. Mitochondria also play a key role in mediating intrinsic apoptosis, an energy dependent cell death pathway regulated by numerous positive and negative signaling factors that exist in dynamic equilibrium. Distally, intrinsic apoptosis can be induced by a variety of physiological or pathological cell stressors, such as toxins, viral infections, hypoxia, hyperthermia, free radicals, and DNA damage. Proximately, the intrinsic pathway is induced by the loss of anti-apoptotic proteins, (e.g., Bcl-2 and Bcl-x) or by activation of pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax and Bak). Intrinsic apoptosis involves mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), the critical, irreversible step in the pathway that commits the cell to ultimate destruction. MOMP is followed by the release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic proteins from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space. Once released into the cytosol, these proteins activate a caspase cascade, which leads to the proteolytic cleavage of intracellular proteins, DNA degradation, formation of apoptotic bodies, and other morphological changes that are considered hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Both the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which involves cell membrane receptor-mediated interactions, play significant roles in normal development, tissue remodeling, aging, wound healing, immune response, and maintaining homeostasis in the adult human body. 3. Some Notable Differences between Mitochondria of Cancer Cells and Normal Cells Nearly a century has passed since Otto Warburg first observed high rates of aerobic glycolysis in a variety of tumor cell types and suggested that this phenomenon might be due to an impaired respiratory capacity in these cells. Warburg’s observations prompted many scientists to focus their investigative efforts on the mitochondria of cancer cells in an attempt to understand the underlying basis for the “Warburg Effect”, i.e., enhanced glucose uptake, high rate of glycolysis in the presence of sufficient oxygen, and an increase in lactic acid as a byproduct of the glycolytic pathway. It is now known that at least some cancer cells possess a normal capacity for oxidative phosphorylation and can, under certain conditions, generate a majority of their ATP from this process. In addition, recent evidence suggests that the enhanced glucose uptake and metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells is more likely due to their greater need for glucose metabolites, which serve as precursors for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids, amino acids, and lipids in these rapidly dividing cell populations, rather than to any specific impairment in respiratory function. In the years since Warburg’s initial observations, however, a number of notable differences between the mitochondria of normal and transformed cells have been identified. These include differences in the size, number and shape of the organelle, the rates of protein synthesis and organelle turnover, and the polypeptide and lipid profiles of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Metabolic aberrations specifically associated with mitochondrial bioenergetic function in cancer cells include differences with regard to preference for respiratory substrates, rates of electron and anion transport, calcium uptake and retention, and decreased activities of certain enzymes integral to the process of oxidative phosphorylation, such as cytochrome c oxidase, adenine nucleotide translocase, and mitochondrial ATPase. The mitochondrial membrane potential has also been shown to be significantly higher in carcinoma cells than in normal epithelial cells. Alterations in mitochondrial genome sequence have also been linked to a variety of cancers. Some are germ-line mutations. Among these, a human polymorphic variant in the NADH dehydrogenase 3 (ND3) gene at nt 10,398 (nt G10398A) that alters the structure of Complex I in the mitochondrial ETC was associated with an increased risk for invasive breast cancer in African–American women, the A12308G mutation in tRNALeu(CUN) was associated with increased risk of both renal and prostate cancers, and a variant in a non-coding region of mtDNA (16189T>C) was associated with increased susceptibility to endometrial cancer. Somatic mutations in the mitochondrial genome are more common and have been observed in a wide variety of cancers, including ovarian, uterine, liver, lung, colon, gastric, brain, bladder, prostate, and breast cancer, melanoma and leukemia. The displacement loop (or D-loop) region, a triple stranded non-coding sequence of mtDNA (np 16024-516) that houses cis regulatory elements required for replication and transcription of the molecule, has been shown to be a mutational “hot spot” in human cancer. However, mutations in genes encoding the polypeptide subunits of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation also occur and can be of functional significance. Some of these are thought to be adaptive mutations that confer a selective advantage under the harsh growth conditions of the tumor microenvironment. Others have been shown to be involved directly in tumor initiation and/or progression. For example, introduction of the pathogenic mtDNA ATP6 T8993G mutation into the PC3 prostate cancer cell line through cybrid transfer produced tumors in nude mice that were 7-fold greater in size than those produced by wild-type cybrids. Additionally, mutations in the mtDNA gene encoding NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) produced a deficiency in respiratory Complex I activity that was associated with an enhanced metastatic potential of tumor cells. In general, tumor cells also exhibit higher levels of ROS than normal cells, and oxidative stress has been suggested to underlie the development and/or maintenance of the malignant phenotype. As noted previously, oxidative stress can cause somatic mutations in mtDNA. Evidence suggests that the converse is also true, i.e., certain mutations in mtDNA, especially those in genes encoding ETC enzyme subunits, can cause ROS overproduction. Oncogene activation is also known to enhance the production of mitochondrial ROS, which has been implicated as a mechanism for K-RAS and MYC-mediated cell transformation. In tumor cells, oxidative stress activates signaling pathways that promote cell growth and metastasis. One such pathway involves hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which regulates the transcription of a large number of genes that facilitate cell survival at low oxygen pressures. Under the hypoxic conditions of tumor cell growth, mitochondria act as O2 sensors and further enhance ROS generation as an adaptive response. ROS overproduction stabilizes the HIF-α subunit, facilitating its dimerization with the HIF-β subunit. This activates a number of different genes, including those mediating a metabolic shift toward glycolysis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. ROS have also been shown to activate MAP kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways, which are important for cell proliferation and survival, and to up-regulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and Snail proteins, which are involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis, respectively. Inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is also observed in a number of hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors, and has been implicated in cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. This is thought to occur as a result of dysregulation of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins of the Bcl-2 family, and may involve overexpression or enhanced function of anti-apoptotic proteins, under-expression or loss of function of pro-apoptotic proteins, or a combination of both. For example, malignant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express high levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and low levels of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax. Interestingly, the progression of CLL is thought to be due to reduced apoptosis rather than increased proliferation in vivo. Overexpression of Bcl-2 has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in prostate, lung, colorectal and gastric cancers, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and breast carcinoma cells. An imbalance in the expression of the anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins is thought to stabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane, prevent MOMP and the release of cytochrome c, and ultimately, inhibit programmed cell death. This failure of normal cell turnover contributes to cell accumulation, transformation, and survival under extreme conditions, such as the hypoxic or acidic environments common in tumors. Interestingly, the inhibition of apoptosis that results from dysregulation of Bcl-2 protein expression has also been shown to underlie the development of drug resistance in cancer cells. For example, the overexpression Bcl-XL protects murine pro-lymphocytic cells from a wide variety of apoptotic stimuli and confers a multidrug resistance phenotype, and drug-induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells cultured in vitro is inversely related to Bcl-2/Bax ratios. 4. Mitochondria-Targeted Drugs that Show Selective Cancer Cell Killing During the past few decades, scientists have been exploring the possibility that certain structural and functional differences that exist between the mitochondria of normal and transformed cells might serve as targets for selective cell killing by novel and site-specific anticancer agents. Recently, the term “mitocan” (an acronym for mitochondria and cancer) has been proposed to classify mitochondria-targeted anticancer agents, especially those that induce mitochondrial destabilization. A number of these compounds have shown efficacy in selective cancer cell killing in pre-clinical and early clinical testing (see Table 1 for a representative sampling). Among the earliest known mitochondria-targeted anticancer agents are the delocalized lipophilic cations (DLCs). Due to their lipophilicity and positive charge, these compounds selectively accumulate in the mitochondria of carcinoma cells in response to a higher, negative inside membrane potential (e.g., approximately 160 mV in carcinoma vs. 100 mV in control epithelial cells). Several DLCs have exhibited efficacy in carcinoma cell killing in vitro and in vivo, including the class prototype Rhodamine 123 (Rh123), dequalinium chloride (DECA), and the thiopyrylium AA-1. Although all DLCs are taken up into mitochondria by a common mechanism and display dose dependent mitochondrial toxicity, their specific mechanism of action can be quite varied. For example, Rh123 and AA-1 inhibit mitochondrial ATP synthesis at the level of F0F1-ATPase activity, while DECA and certain DLC thiacarbocyanines interfere with NADH-ubiquinone reductase (ETC Complex I) activity. Another DLC, the water-soluble rhodacyanine dye analogue MKT-077, was shown to cause a more generalized deleterious effect on respiratory function through membrane perturbation and consequent inhibition of membrane-bound enzymes. MKT-077 was the first DLC with a favorable pharmacological and toxicological profile and showed great promise as a selective anticancer agent in preclinical studies. Phase I trials were undertaken to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of MKT-077, but were halted due to recurrent but reversible renal toxicity in about half of the patients treated. It was determined, however, that it is feasible to target mitochondria with rhodacyanine analogues if drugs with higher therapeutic indices could be developed. More recently, evidence suggests that the widely prescribed anti-diabetic biguanide derivative, metformin, may also be effective in the prevention and treatment of human cancer via inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory function. Retrospective analyses show an association between the use of metformin and diminished cancer risk, progression and mortality in diabetic patients. In vitro laboratory studies demonstrate that metformin has a direct and selective inhibitory effect on breast, colon, ovary, pancreas, lung, and prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, at doses that had no effect on the viability of non-cancer stem cells, metformin inhibited transformation and selectively killed cancer stem cells resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. In vivo, metformin inhibits the growth of spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors, and impacts tumor growth in mouse xenograft and syngeneic models. Furthermore, prospective studies investigating the therapeutic efficacy of metformin use in non-diabetic cancer patients suggest its promise for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer and treatment of early breast cancer. It has been postulated that the therapeutic effects of metformin may be associated with both direct (insulin-independent) and indirect (insulin-dependent) actions of the drug. However, results of a recent study showed that the direct inhibition of cancer cell mitochondrial Complex I by metformin was required to decrease cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. Interestingly, it has been shown that cancer cell lines harboring mutations in mtDNA encoded Complex I subunits or having impaired glucose utilization exhibit enhanced biguanide sensitivity when grown under the low glucose conditions seen in the tumor microenvironment. Metformin is a very safe and well-tolerated drug that is now prescribed to almost 120 million people in the world for the treatment of type II diabetes. Clinical trials using metformin alone and in combination with conventional anticancer agents in non-diabetic patients are ongoing and should clarify its potential use in cancer therapy. Mitochondria-targeted ROS regulators have also shown efficacy as anticancer agents. Although the generally higher endogenous levels of ROS in tumor versus normal cells contribute to the development and/or maintenance of the malignant phenotype, they also render cancer cells more vulnerable to irreversible oxidative damage and consequent cell death. Therefore, pro-oxidant pharmacological agents that either enhance ROS production or inhibit ROS scavenging activity have the potential to increase ROS level beyond the threshold of lethality in cancer cells while leaving normal cells viable. One such compound that targets mitochondria is elesclomol (STA-4783), an investigational, first-in-class small molecule that has been shown to enhance ROS production and induce a transcriptional gene profile characteristic of an oxidative stress response in vitro. Interestingly, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine blocks elesclomol induced gene expression and apoptosis, indicating that ROS generation is the primary mechanism of cytotoxicity of the drug. Comparative growth assays using the yeast model S. cerevisiae demonstrated that elesclomol interacts with the mitochondrial ETC to generate high levels of ROS and induce apoptosis. In the same study, elesclomol was shown to interact similarly with the ETC in human melanoma cells. Elesclomol was granted fast-track designation by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. A randomized, double-blind, controlled SYMMETRY study evaluating the combination of paclitaxel and elesclomol in patients with advanced melanoma was stopped after all patients were enrolled because the addition of elesclomol to paclitaxel did not significantly improve progression free survival in unselected patients. Studies are ongoing to determine the effect of elesclomol treatment alone and in combination with paclitaxel in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and ovarian cancer. Bezielle (BZL101), an aqueous extract from the herb Scutellaria barbata, is another ROS regulator that displays selective cytotoxicity against a variety of cancers in vitro and in vivo. Early studies showed that in tumor cells, but not in non-transformed cells, Bezielle induces ROS production and causes severe DNA damage followed by hyperactivation of PARP-1, depletion of the cellular ATP and NAD, inhibition of glycolysis, and cell death. It was later shown that treatment of tumor cells with Bezielle induces progressively higher levels of both mitochondrial superoxide and peroxide type ROS, and that Bezielle inhibits oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, tumor cells lacking functional mitochondria did not generate mitochondrial superoxide and were protected from cell death in the presence of Bezielle, supporting the hypothesis that mitochondria are the primary target of the compound. Bezielle has shown promising efficacy and excellent safety in the early phase clinical trials for advanced breast cancer. Mitochondria-targeted compounds that induce outer membrane permeabilization and intrinsic apoptosis in cancer cells also show potential as anti-cancer agents. As previously discussed, BCL-2 family proteins, which share one or more of the four BCL-2 homology domains (BH1–BH4), regulate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Anti-apoptotic members of the family (such as BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W and MCL-1), which are overexpressed in many cancers, function by sequestering the pro-apoptotic executioners of the MOMP (such as BAX and BAK). Inhibition of programmed cell death is antagonized by BH3-only proteins, a BCL-2 protein subfamily comprised of only the α-helical BH3 domain. These small proteins interact with anti-apoptotic molecules in their BH3-binding groove, causing the release and activation of BAX/BAK and inducing apoptosis. Certain small molecules mimic the effect of BH3-only proteins. Among these BH3 mimetics, the synthetically derived ABT-737 has been shown to induce BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines in vitro, and to display antitumor effects as a single agent in vivo. Navitoclax (ABT-263), a potent, orally bioavailable analog of ABT-737 with similar biological activity, was shown to elicit complete tumor regression in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenograft models. A phase I clinical study investigating the single-agent activity of navitoclax in the treatment of recurrent SCLC yielded encouraging preliminary safety and efficacy data. However, in a subsequent phase II study navitoclax treatment induced only a low positive response and was limited by a dose-dependent and clinically significant thrombocytopenia. Since both ABT-737 and navitoclax have been shown to potentiate the efficacy of standard cytotoxic agents against a variety of cancers, combinatorial regimens may ultimately prove a more promising therapeutic strategy for these compounds. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that several other BH3 mimetics, such as the natural polyphenolic compound gossypol, and the synthetic compounds GX15-070 (obatoclax) and HA14-1 (ethyl 2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate), also demonstrate anti-cancer activity, supporting the therapeutic potential of this class of mitochondria-targeted agents in the treatment of human cancer.",3730
23870510,"1. OXIDATIVE STRESS CHANGES THE BREAST TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT Cancer is one of the most common diseases in the United States. In 2012, breast cancer alone was expected to account for 29% (226,870) of all new cancer cases among women in the United States. It is known that one in eight women will develop breast cancer during their lives, and almost 40,000 will die because of breast cancer metastasis. Men are also at risk of breast cancer and it is estimated that in 2012, almost 2190 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 410 will die due to this disease. Breast cancer is not only an isolated group of mutated somatic cells, but it is also a microenvironment system comprising breast cancer cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, immune, and endothelial cells (Fig. 3.1). Close interactions between cancer cells and stroma are known to regulate breast cancer pathways. Among the many factors influencing development, progression, and metastasis, oxidative stress has an important role in the initiation and preservation of breast cancer progression. Oxidative stress results from an imbalance between unstable reactive species lacking one or more unpaired electrons (superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, reactive nitrogen species) and antioxidants. Oxidative stress can be generated by ultraviolet light exposure, ionizing radiation, or carcinogen exposure. One way in which cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) impact cell signaling is through their localized accumulation, if we consider ROS byproducts of the electron transport chain in mitochondria or activation of the NADPH oxidases (NOX). Induced pathways producing ROS function in all cell types, including both breast carcinoma and cancer stroma. Stromal-derived NOX4 ROS are able to stimulate migration of MCF-7 cells in a paracrine manner. Overexpression of NOX4 in normal breast epithelial cells results in cellular senescence, resistance to apoptosis, and tumorigenic transformation, as well as increased aggressiveness of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, several recent studies have confirmed that ROS, including hydrogen peroxide, alone are able to drive the differentiation of normal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which are able to generate high amounts of hydrogen peroxide themselves, increasing oxidative stress in the microenvironment (Fig. 3.2). Almost 80% of fibroblasts acquire an activated phenotype in breast cancer. Myofibroblasts are highly mobile and contractile cells that typically express mesenchymal markers such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), calponin, and vimentin. Additionally, type I collagen secreted by myofibroblasts causes higher breast density, which contributes to mammary tumor formation and metastasis. It has also been shown that type I collagen contributes to decreased chemotherapeutic agent uptake and altered tumor cell sensitivity to a variety of chemotherapies. Not only collagen deposition but also collagen degradation is required for the physiologic remodeling of connective tissue during breast cancer growth, development, and cancer cell invasion. Secreted metalloproteinases (MMP) such as MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 increase extracellular matrix turnover and are themselves activated by oxidative stress. Additionally secreted transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor 2, and stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1) are able to activate fibroblasts and increase cancer cell proliferation. Growth factors such as TGFβ, IGF, TNFα, or PDGF stimulate ROS production through NOX. Once activated, the tumor microenvironment network produces large amounts of ROS, initiating tumor growth. It would be clinically advantageous to detect this large ROS activity early enough to prevent further cancer progression. There is only one clinical study showing that such a possibility exists. The research involving an equal number of breast cancer patients and healthy controls showed increased levels of hydrogen peroxide in exhaled breath condensate from patients with localized breast malignancy, associated with increased clinical severity. 2. OXIDATIVE STRESS REGULATE CAVEOLIN-1 SIGNALING AND ENERGY METABOLISM IN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT Since 1920, the “Warburg Effect” has been the leading principle in understanding breast cancer development resulting from dysfunctional mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This mechanism was shown to be incomplete. Specifically based on the “Warburg Effect,” the recently proposed “Reverse Warburg Effect” underscores an important and supportive role for oxidative stress and the microenvironment in cancer progression. It was shown that aerobic glycolysis occurs in the adjacent stroma, rather than in cancer cells. Stromal autophagy drives cancer cell growth and progression by providing fatty acids, nucleotides, and free amino acids that are ready for use by cancer cells. Moreover, catabolites produced by stroma-associated fibro-blasts not only stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in breast cancer cells, they also protect them from autophagy and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Comparing mitochondrial metabolic activity revealed a difference between stroma and epithelial cells. While breast cancer epithelial cells appear to have increased mitochondrial oxidative activity, as shown by their elevated levels of NADH dehydrogenase, saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), and cyclooxygenase. Activated stroma fibroblasts, on the other hand, exhibit a low mitochondrial oxidative capacity, low translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20, yet high expression of monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) and the lysosomal protease—cathepsin B. Not surprisingly, breast cancer tumors that exhibit upregulation of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are prone to metastasize to the brain, which itself is a lactate-rich environment. This creates an ideal condition for tumor progression. A recent study has shown that cancer cells are able to induce drivers of oxidative stress, autophagy and mitophagy: HIF-1α and NFκB in surrounding stroma fibro-blasts. This process can lead to loss of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Cav-1 is highly expressed in differentiated fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells. Loss of Cav-1 in CAFs is consideNorthwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USAred to be a “lethal” breast tumor microenvironment, as it is linked with tamoxifen resistance, increased lymph node metastasis, early tumor recurrence, and poor overall outcome. In triple negative breast cancer stroma, the loss of Cav-1 in ~10%of cases was linked with a ≤5-year survival rate compared to approximately 75% of cases where Cav-1 stroma-positive patients had a 12 year survival rate. Interestingly, oxidative stress is sufficient to induce the loss of Cav-1 in fibroblasts due to lysosomal degradation of Cav-1. In support of this, knockdown of Cav-1 in immortalized human fibroblasts (hTERT-BJ1) results in increased hydrogen peroxide generation, which can further induce Cav-1 loss in neighboring fibroblasts. Studies show that loss of Cav-1 in adjacent breast cancer stroma fibroblasts can be prevented by treatment with N-acetyl cysteine, quercetin, or metformin. It was reported that overexpression of recombinant (SOD2) or injection of SOD, catalase, or their pegylated counterparts can block recurrence and metastasis in mice. Of note, mammary stromal cells fromCav-1 (–/–) null mice have upregulated myofibroblast markers (vimentin, calponin2, tropomyosin, gelsolin, and prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha), EF-1-δ (elongation factor 1-delta: which can drive cell transformation and tumorigenesis), signaling molecules (annexin A1, annexin A2, and RhoGDI), glycolytic enzymes (M2-isoform of pyruvate kinase-PKM2 and LDHA), secreted proteins (type I collagen and SPARC), and two peroxidases: catalase and peroxiredoxin-1 (Prdx1). Consistent with this premise, a study exam-ining mammary stroma from human breast cancer specimens using laser-capture microdissection and molecular profiling revealed that patients with Cav-1 negative breast cancer stroma had higher expression of genes associ-ated with oxidative stress, hypoxia, redox signaling, apoptosis, autophagy, lysosomal degradation, glycolysis aging, “stemness,” inflammation, DNA damage, and myofibroblast differentiation. The reduction of Cav-1 occurs in both subtypes of breast cancers: estrogen receptor positive ER(+), and estrogen receptor negative ER(–). However, it was shown to be significantly associated with ER(–) cancers, increased recurrence, and decreased overall survival, suggesting perhaps that hormone receptor negative breast cancers are linked to higher levels of ROS. Along those lines, when exposed to estrogenic polychlorinated biphenyls, the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 produced significantly higher amounts of ROS than the poorly metastatic T47D cell line. Moreover, treatment of breast cancer cells with physiologic levels of 17 beta estradiol induces ROS production and activates redox sensitive signaling pathways in neighboring cells, leading to angiogenesis, tumor growth, and invasiveness. Lowered expression of Cav-1 not only leads to myofibroblast conversion and inflammation but also seems to impact aerobic glycolysis, leading to secretion of high energy metabolites such as pyruvate and lactate that drive mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells. Pyruvate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that converts pyruvate into acetyl-coA, is decreased in stromal fibroblasts due to Cav-1 loss. Depletion of Cav-1 activates HIF-1α and creates a lactate-rich environment due to the forced conversion of aerobic pyruvate into lactate (; Sotgia et al., 2011b). It is widely held that HIF-1α function is dependent upon its location within the tumor microenvironment. It acts as a tumor promoter in CAFs and as a tumor suppressor in cancer cells. Oxidative stress generated by breast cancer cells activates HIF-1α and NFκB in fibroblasts, leading to autophagy and lysosomal degradation of Cav-1. Thus, the level of Cav-1 in the microenvironment serves as an ideal marker for oxidative stress, hypoxia, and autophagy. The close relationship between oxidative stress, Cav-1, and energy metabolism is further illustrated by the finding that loss of Cav-1 results in the expression of two monocarboxylate transporters: MCT1 and MCT4. MCT4 expression is only increased in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts, whereas MCT1 expression appears to be restricted to breast cancer cells. As this allows for proper import of lactate from fibroblasts into cancer cells, such findings again underscore the intimate relationship between these two compartments. In support of this, higher levels of MCT4 in the tumor stroma are associate with poor outcome in triple negative breast cancer, while MCT4 expression in breast cancer cells had no significant predictive value. In contrast, MCT1 expression in breast cancer cells was linked to p53 mutations, p53 loss, and poor outcome. Given that the prognostic value of MCT4 is restricted to breast cancer stroma and MCT1 to breast cancer epithelial cells, MCT4, and MCT1 in combination with Cav-1, may be functional markers of oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis, exclusively in tumor stroma. 3. OXIDATIVE STRESS CAUSES FIBROBLASTS TO UNDERGO SENESCENCE AND INDUCES MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION By the age of 40, breast cancer risk in women is 1 in 203, but it rapidly increases: for women over 40 years of age, it is 1 in 28 and by age 70, 1 in 15 females will develop breast cancer. Over the years, somatic mutations accumulate and increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Phenotypically, senescent cells partially resemble aging cells. For example, senescent fibroblasts are locked in a nonproliferative state, suffer multiple phenotypic changes and are able to secrete factors influencing endothelial cells, pushing them toward a carcinogenic pathway. Besides other stressors, including ionizing radiation, oncogenes, and environmental factors, hydrogen peroxide is one of the main factors that can push fibroblasts and cancer cells into senescence. It was reported that hydrogen peroxide- induced senescence and autophagy are closely linked processes that may be mutually induced. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is a crucial factor in initiating DNA synthesis during the mammalian cell division cycle. CDKs are regulated by CDK inhibitors such as p16 and p19, which also function as tumor suppressors. In CAFs, the CDK inhibitors p19 and smARF drive senescence and autophagy, resulting in increased angiogenesis and promotion of tumor growth. Fibroblasts expressing cell cycle inhibitors, such as p19 and smARF, are predisposed to hydrogen peroxide initiated senescence. In human ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS), increases in p16 are linked with a ninefold increased risk of recurrence. Recent data have revealed that cell cycle arrest, senescence, and autophagy are closely related biological processes, which can be induced by the same stimuli and can arise simultaneously in a given cell. Senescence can induce autophagy in CAFs and they undergo senescence-autophagy transition. It was shown that overexpression of autophagy inducers in fibroblasts leads to autophagy. Moreover, these fibroblasts express the active senescence markers β-galactosidase and p21 and they gain a senescence-associated secretory phenotype resulting in secretion of numerous growth factors, cytokines, and proteases that promote migration and invasion of cancer cells, independent of angiogenesis. Of note, selective induction of autophagy only in breast cancer cells inhibits tumor growth. Fibroblast senescence is able to attenuate the functional differentiation of cells and increases branching morphogenesis of normal mammary epithelial cells. Branching is a physiological process in which secretion of soluble factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), MMP2, and MMP3 by fibroblasts, induces epithelial cells to invade and migrate through collagen in a controlled manner. Therefore, during carcinogenesis, fibroblasts support branching but control of this process is lost. Moreover, in aging mammary glands, the number of senescent fibroblasts along with IL-6 and -8 secretion increases. This in turn promotes malignant processes such as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in premalignant epithelial cells. Recent studies show that in the breast cancer microenvironment, oxidative stress causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which manifests itself by the upregulation of numerous factors, such as the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), which was shown to be upregulated in cancer stroma due to oxidative stress. NRF1 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of genes regulating cellular growth, respiration, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and replication. Hydrogen peroxide was shown to increase levels of mtDNA absence sensitive factor—GOLPH3/MIDAS. This oncogene modulates mTOR signaling and is able to increase mitochondrial mass by regulating mitochondrial lipids in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. mtDNA is extremely sensitive to oxidative damage due to the lack of protective histones and efficient repair mechanisms located in the nucleus. This is the mechanism by which excess mitochondrial ROS promotes malignant cell transformation. It was recently demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing the human catalase gene (mCAT) in mammary tumors had reduced primary tumor invasiveness and decreased pulmonary metastatic tumor incidence compared to mice that lacked mCAT. The presence of mCAT in fibroblasts leads to altered phosphorylation of p38MAPK (downstream ROS signaling pathway) in response to hydrogen peroxide. This lowered oxidative stress and selectin expression and decreased the colonization ability and metastatic potential of cancer cells. Mitochondrial malfunction leads to oversaturation with ROS in cancer cells and thereby cancer risk. This detrimental process is comprised of numerous factors. For example, loss of mitochondrial transcription factor A results in compromised transcription of mtDNA. Persistent exposure to oxidative stressors or other DNA damaging agents eventually leads to accumulation of DNA mutations in every tissue. Therefore, increased cancer risk with aging can be attributed to somatic mutations or alterations of gene copy number in the adjacent stroma. Particularly in breast cancer, somatic mutations in TP53 and PTEN and gene copy number alterations at other loci in the adjacent stroma have been described. PTEN, a protein tyrosine and lipid phosphatase, is a crucial tumor suppressor in most cancers, including breast. PTEN belongs to a class of phosphatases known to be prone to inactivation induced by oxidative stress. Supporting this premise, we have recently shown that Prdx1 prevents PTEN oxidation-induced inactivation preventing H-Ras and human epidermal growth factor 2 (ErbB-2)-driven transformations. Over the last few years, an impressive body of work describing PTEN's tumor suppressive role in epithelial cells, including breast, has accumulated. However, a very recent elegant study defined PTEN's tumor suppressive role in mammary stromaassociated fibroblasts, enforcing the importance of oxidative stress promoting cancer through regulating the tumor microenvironment. mtDNA polymorphisms and oxidative stress sensitivity may be underappreciated factors in breast carcinogenesis. The mtDNA 10398A allele was reported to increase breast cancer susceptibility in African-American women, whereas the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) polymorphism (A10398G) is linked to sporadic breast cancer in Poland. It was also shown that mtDNA 10398G allele carriers have increased breast cancer risk due to alcohol consumption, perhaps as a result of the alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde, which increases oxidative stress-induced damage of mtDNA. Smoking not only increases oxidative stress, but also augments mtDNA copy number, which correlates with an increased risk for breast cancer. It was reported that oxidative stress leads to HIF-1α accumulation and junD gene inactivation in fibroblasts. This event likely activates fibroblasts that express elevated levels of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF1) and have expression profiles similar to carcinoma-associated fibroblast profiles. Not surprisingly, accumulation of SDF1 in ErbB-2 positive breast cancer is linked with increased numbers of activated fibro-blasts and increased lymph node metastasis. In addition, HIF-1α is known to regulate mitochondrial sirtuin NAD-dependent protein deacetylases 3 (SIRT3), a mitochondrial tumor suppressor, which maintains mitochondrial integrity and guards proper oxidative metabolism. Given the cancer preventive role of healthy mitochondria, it is not unexpected that loss of SIRT3 in fibroblasts would result in a tumorigenic phenotype and enhance breast cancer development. Healthy mitochondria are essential for maintaining energy, redox, and calcium balance. Impairments in mitochondrial function, and/or mechanisms controlling autophagy removal of damaged mitochondria lead to altered mitochondrial metabolisms and can promote cancer development. Another example of how oxidative stress may alter mitochondrial function to promote tumorigenesis through the microenvironment is via mammalian stanniocalcin 1 (STC1). STC1 has been found to be massively upregulated in mouse fibroblasts due to ROS accumulation. Examination of STC-1 mRNA levels in multiple tumor samples showed that this glycoprotein was upregulated in many cancer types and might serve as a marker of micrometastasis.",2783
24852434,"Introduction Mitochondria are the principal source of cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generated through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which is linked to the respiratory chain. In humans, thirteen OXPHOS proteins are synthesised from the 16.5 Kb mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). MtDNA has accumulated genetic variants over time, and being strictly maternally inherited, undergoes negligible intermolecular recombination. As a consequence, ancient variants extant in the human population define haplogroups that have remained geographically or ethnically restricted. Work on European haplogroups has shown that some polymorphic mtDNA variants affect mitochondrial function. Given emerging evidence that mitochondria play a key role in several common diseases, it is likely that variation of mtDNA could alter the risk of developing different human disorders. Early mtDNA genetic association studies were under-powered, and the vast majority have not been replicated. However, some recent large studies have found replicable associations with specific human diseases, most notably in sporadic Parkinson's disease. These observations implicate mtDNA as part of the “missing heritability” of complex human disease traits. Ultimately, mtDNA codes for a limited number of proteins that affect the same common pathway of energy production implicated in several human diseases. It is likely, therefore, that functional genetic variation of mtDNA will have impact on more than one disease – but this has not been directly studied before. To test this hypothesis, we analysed mtDNA SNP data from 51,106 subjects from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, comparing genotypes from 11 major diseases: ankylosing spondylitis (AS, n = 2,005), ischemic stroke (IS, n = 4,205), multiple sclerosis (MS, n = 11,377), Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 2,197), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n = 1,921), psoriasis (PS, n = 2,622), schizophrenia (SP, n = 2,019), ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 2,869), coronary artery disease (CAD, n = 3,215), hypertension (HT, n = 2,943) and type-2 diabetes (T2D, n = 2,975) to three independent control groups genotyped on the same platforms (WTCCC-58C, n = 2997, WTCCC-NBS, n = 2897 and WTCCC2-MetabaloChip, n = 5841). Results Common mtDNA variants are associated with common disease After applying stringent quality control measures (Supplementary Materials, Table S1 & S2), we initially compared the two healthy control groups using PLINK v2.050 (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1), and found no significant difference in allele frequencies. We therefore merged control groups genotyped on the same platform for all subsequent analyses as follows: WTCCC-Control-1, WTCCC-Control-2 and WTCCC-Control-3 (Supplementary Materials, Table S2). Cluster plots produced by principle component analysis (PCA) revealed no significant population stratification when comparing either: datasets from the same array or array-specific control datasets (Supplementary Materials, Figure S4). We then compared genotyped SNPs in each disease group to platform-matched control datasets using PLINK v2.050 ( Figure 1   & Supplementary Materials, Table S3). This confirmed previously reported associations at the low-resolution haplogroup level, endorsing the methodological approach. Phylogenetically-related mtDNA variants are associated with common disease Next we performed lexical tree building to identify new associations with phylogenetically related variants, but without basing our anlysis on any prior assumptions related to the published mtDNA haplogroup structure. This method uses fewer SNPs because individuals with missing SNP data cannot be used, but has greated power, and provides graphical summaries of the combinations of SNPs that are associated with increased or descreased risk of disease (Supplementary Materials, Table S4). Lexical tree analysis identified significant relationships between the mtDNA tree structure and schizophrenia, primary biliary cirrhosis, multiple sclerosis (each at p<10−6), ulcerative colitis (p<10−4), and Parkinson's disease (p = 0.004) ( Table 1   and Supplementary Materials Figure S3), independently confirming previous haplogroup based association associations, and revealing new mtDNA clades associated with several different diseases. The other case-control trees, and comparisons between the different control populations were not significant at the 1% level. Imputed mtDNA variants are associated with several different common diseases To determine the functional basis of the associations we imputed missing genotypes across the whole mitochondrial genome using 7,729 complete mtDNA sequences. Subsequent analyses were performed on 35,901 European cases and 15,302 European controls, and captured 40.41% of European mtDNA population genetic variation (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2). In keeping with our original hypothesis, specific variants with predicted functional consequences conferred either an increased risk ( Table 2a ) or decreased risk ( Table 2b ) across several different diseases. In addtion, we identified the same allelic-specific associations for different diseases compared to different platform-specific control groups, re-inforcing these findings. Functional variants associated with an increased risk in two or more diseases were limited to two structural genes: MTCYB (m.14793, m.15218) and MTCO3 (m.9477, m.9667). The only non-synonmous protien encoding variant consistently associated with a reduced risk of disease was in MTND3 (m.10398). We also found evidence of associations across multiple diseases within the non-coding region (d-loop) of mtDNA, and 16S ribosomal RNA subunit genes ( Figure 2  and  Table 2  and Supplementary Materials, Table. S3). Intriguingly, the same alleles were not associated with all of the diseases we studied, and for two variants (m.11299, m.16294), the same allele had opposite effects for two different diseases ( Table 2c ). Overall, the majority of disease-associated alleles conferred an increased risk (61/99), and not a decreased risk (38/99, P<0.001) (Supplementary Materials, Table S3).",833
33728047,"Introduction Mitochondria are the primary site of energy production via the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This process involves the transfer of electrons from reduced nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) to oxygen through highly conserved mitochondrial membrane-bound enzyme complexes (I-V) of the electron transport chain (ETC) to create ATP. Mitochondria are also an essential source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as by-products of normal mitochondrial metabolism. One of the mitochondria's unique features is that it contains its own genome (mtDNA), separate and distinct from the nuclear genome of the cell. Human mtDNA is a double-stranded and circular molecule of 16,569 bp and contains two regions. The coding region encompasses 37 genes, which encode 13 crucial protein subunits of the ETC, two ribosomal (r)RNAs, and 22 transfer (t)RNAs. The control or regulatory (D-loop) region consists of sites for replicating and transcribing of the mtDNA. Except for complex II subunits, which are entirely encoded by the nuclear DNA (nDNA), subunits of complex I, III, IV and V are encoded by both nDNA and mtDNA. Specifically, mtDNA codes for seven subunits (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5 and ND6) of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase of complex I, cytochrome b (CYTB) subunit of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase of complex III, three subunits (CO1, CO2 and CO3) of cytochrome c oxidase of complex IV and two subunits (ATPase 6 and 8) of ATP synthase of the complex. The mtDNA is particularly susceptible to oxidative damage and has a high mutational rate due to its proximity to the site of ROS production, the lack of protective histones, and low DNA repair capacity. Since mtDNA encodes essential components of the ETC, these mutations can disrupt the mitochondria's ability to generate energy for the cell. Indeed, mtDNA mutations are linked with a wide range of human diseases. Although primary mutations in the mtDNA have been observed in diseases of mitochondrial origin, secondary mutations and new variants are also involved in aging and may underlie the predisposition of several common diseases, such as neurodegenerative, metabolic and inflammatory conditions. It is therefore useful to sequence the complete mitochondrial genome to explore disease-related variants in the mtDNA. Psoriasis (Ps) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease characterized by hyperproliferative keratinocytes and the infiltration of the dermis by various immune cells. Ps affects ~3% of the population worldwide, and its incidence is also high in the Gulf countries, including Kuwait, where it affects around ~3% of people. Several studies have shown an association between Ps and metabolic syndrome, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), in which T2D was found to be twice as prevalent in patients with Ps. T2D is a progressive metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycaemia due to inadequate insulin secretion from the β-cells and insulin resistance. T2D is a leading cause of severe vascular complications, including cardiovascular disease, which is frequently observed in Ps patients. Whilst the nature of the relationship between Ps and T2D remains ambiguous, both of these diseases are multifactorial, involving an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Amongst the genetic factors that may explain the co-occurrence of Ps and T2D, variations in mtDNA have been suggested. In this context, studies have shown a potential role of mtDNA variants in the susceptibility or risk of T2D in different populations, including in Asian, European and other populations. Similarly, the role of mtDNA variants in Ps has been observed in a European population. However, these studies have demonstrated ethnic diversity in the distribution or the implications of mtDNA variants in Ps and T2D. To date, there are no studies that have investigated variations in the mtDNA in patients with Ps alone or in patients with Ps and T2D (Ps-T2D) in the Arab population, to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, this study aimed to sequence and compare whole mitochondrial genomes from Kuwaiti subjects with Ps, T2D, Ps-T2D and healthy controls to identify mtDNA variants in Arab individuals in Kuwait. Results Characteristics of the study subjects The study included 98 subjects, 34 patients with Ps, 15 patients with T2D, 29 patients with Ps-T2D and 20 healthy controls. Table I shows the characteristics of the study subjects. There was no significant difference in the mean age between the study subjects. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the sex distribution amongst the study subjects. The mean value of fasting glucose differed significantly between patients and controls and was higher in the T2D patients and the Ps-T2D patients compared to the Ps patients and controls (P<0.001). A significant difference in the mean triglyceride levels amongst the subject groups was observed (P≤0.001). The triglyceride levels were normal in the Ps patients, but were borderline high in the T2D patients and high in the Ps-T2D patients. In contrast, a significant difference in the mean value of total cholesterol was found between Ps patients compared with controls (P<0.05), but not between any of the other groups (P>0.05). Novel mtDNA mutations in patients Whole mitochondrial genome sequence analysis revealed several novel mutations that were not previously reported, were not associated with disease in the MitoMap, and are not listed in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database. These included synonymous and non-synonymous mutations detected in patients with Ps, T2D and Ps-T2D, which were not present in the controls. The identified mutations and their characteristics are displayed in Tables II-IV. The majority of the non-synonymous mutations were found in the mtDNA coding region. Most of these were observed in subunit genes of complex I, including ND2, ND4 and ND5. The remaining mutations were found in the CYB gene of complex III and ATP8 subunit gene of complex V. Additionally, the synonymous mutations were found in the mtDNA coding and control regions. In the Ps group (Table II), two missense mutations were found in the ND genes. These included G5262A in the ND2 gene and A12397G in the ND5 gene. The identified synonymous mutations in Ps patients (Table II) were A3711G in the ND1 gene, T5093C and C5303T in the ND2 gene, A10286G in the ND3 gene, A10816G in the ND4 gene, T10667C in the ND4L gene, A13101C in the ND5 gene and T6524C in the CO1 gene. (Fig. 1A; histograms show the A3711G synonymous mutation in the Ps group). In the T2D (Table III), five missense mutations were detected. The missense mutations included, C12084T, G4959A and A11930G in the ND genes, C14751T in the CYB gene, as well as T8951C in the ATP6 gene. Moreover, the T1822C and T2226TA insertion mutations were found in the 16S rRNA gene. The identified synonymous mutations in the group of T2D patients (Table III) were T11386C, G11887A, T12136C, C13077A, C13680T, T5196C, T14020C and A14500G in the ND genes, C7648T and T7783C in the CO2 gene, and T15310C in the CYB gene as well as the A16316G variant in the D-loop control region (Fig. 1B.; histograms show the T11386C synonymous mutation in the T2D group). In the Ps-T2D (Table IV), the C15735T missense mutation was found in the CYB gene. The identified synonymous mutations in the Ps-T2D were T5090C, T11050C, C10556T, C10628T, A13419T and A3720G in the ND genes (Fig. 1C; histograms show the T11050C synonymous mutation in PsT2D group). Several other variants that were previously reported as either missense polymorphisms or synonymous mutations were also found in all the patient groups and are shown in Table V. Known mtDNA sequence variations in patients and controls Analysis of whole mitochondrial genomes from Ps, T2D and Ps-T2D patients and controls revealed the presence of numerous known sequence variations in the coding and control regions of mtDNA (Table VI). When the frequency of these variants was compared between patients and controls, significant results (P<0.05) with odd ratios (OR)>1 were found. Specifically, the G15301A variant in the CYB gene was found at a higher frequency in the three groups of patients, and appeared in 32% of the Ps patients (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2-9; P=0.0001), 20% of the T2D patients (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.9-5; P=0.04) and 21% of the Ps-T2D patients (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1-5.3; P=0.04) compared with the controls (10%). Similarly, the C150T variant in the D-loop was also found at an increased frequency in the three groups of patients and appeared in 26% of the Ps patients (OR, 3; 95% CI, 1.4-7; P=0.003), 20% of the T2D patients (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.9-5; P=0.04) and 24% of the Ps-T2D patients (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-6.3l; P=0.008) compared with the controls (10%), whereas the C12705T variant in the ND5 gene was found at increased frequency in the Ps and Ps-T2D groups: 35% of Ps patients (OR, 3; 95% CI, 1.5-6; P=0.001) and 28% of the Ps-T2D patients (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1-4.4; P=0.03) compared with the controls (15%). The variant A1438G in the 12S rRNA gene was observed in 100% of Ps patients (OR, 11; 95% CI, 1.3-8.7; P=0.005) and 100% of the Ps-T2D patients (OR, 11; 95% CI, 1.3-87; P=0.005) compared with the controls (90%). Some of the identified variants appeared more frequently in specific patient groups compared with the controls (Table VI). In the Ps group, higher frequencies of variants (OR>1, P<0.05) were observed, namely C10400T and T10873C in the ND genes, T14783C in the CYB gene, T9540C in the CO3 gene, and A8701G in the ATPase 6 gene, as well as C16223T and T16519C in the D-loop control region. In the T2D group, increased frequencies of variants (OR>1, P<0.05) were found in the coding region, including A4769G, G11914A, C12633A, G13368A, G13590A and G14364A in the ND genes, G15148A and A15607G in the CYB gene, G15928A in the tRNAThr gene, T10463C in the tRNAArg gene, and G1719A and G1888A in the 16S rRNA gene. Variants in the D-loop control region, namely T195C, C16186T, G16274A, C16292T and C16294T were also found. In the Ps-T2D group, increased frequencies (OR>1, P<0.05) were observed for the T10410C variant in the tRNAArg gene and the G16390A variant in the D-loop region. When these variants' characteristics were analysed (Table VII), the majority of the identified variants were homoplasmic with no amino acid changes. However, the A8701G variant in the ATPase 6 gene, which was located at a higher frequency in 35% of the Ps patients (OR, 2; 95% CI, 1.1-4; P=0.01) compared with 20% in the controls, was identified as a missense mutation and exhibited a threonine to alanine alteration (Thr59Ala).",1714

23671572,"Introduction Cancer cells adapt to hypoxic conditions during progressive tumor cell growth by shifting the burden of energy metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, referred to as the Warburg effect. The regulation of nuclear gene expression by the mitochondrial genome, through ‘mitochondria retrograde signaling’, allows the organelles to coordinate their function with the nucleus. Tumor cells continue to utilize glycolysis as the major energy source even in culture under normoxic conditions, suggesting that possible stable genetic or epigenetic changes have occurred in cancer cells. In addition, cancer mitochondria without detectable genetic changes may transmit oncogenic signals to the nucleus and initiate mitochondrial retrograde regulation leading to the bidirectional communication between the two genomes. In order to investigate the specific mitochondrial contribution to tumor properties, the effect of nuclear genes must be excluded. Transmitochondrial cybrid system is an excellent approach to achieve this goal. Several studies used this exciting technology mostly to show the functional and pathogenic significance of specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations or variants. The mtDNA is known to mutate frequently in a variety of cancers but most of these mtDNA alterations, except a few, are without any known functional relevance and may simply reflect the genomic instability of tumor cells. Even without the presence of known deleterious mtDNA mutations, studies have shown that metastatic mitochondria can enhance the tumor property of a cancer cell and make them metastatic. However, from a therapeutic point of view, in order to target diseased mitochondria, it is important to know whether non-cancerous functional mitochondria can reverse the oncogenic property of metastatic cells. If so, targeting diseased mitochondria or rectifying the functional defect of normal mitochondria may provide a critical druggable area for cancer therapy. In this study, we have asked an interesting question whether non-cancerous mitochondria can reverse the oncogenic properties of an aggressive cancer cell. Under a defined cancerous nuclear background, we compared mitochondria from non-cancerous, moderately metastatic breast cells in a highly metastatic nuclear background with mitochondria from highly aggressive cancer cell as control. Even under the same nuclear background, mitochondria from non-cancerous cells could inhibit several oncogenic pathways, reverse the oncogenic properties and enhance therapeutic response of the cancer cells. This highlights the significance of mitochondria as a critical regulator of cellular cancer property and a potential target for anticancer therapy. Results and Discussion The cybrid technology described here allows the investigation of the effect mitochondria derived from cancer or non-cancer cells on mitochondrial function and oncogenic properties in a common nuclear background. Not all cells can survive under mitochondria depleted conditions. Here we used 143B TK- cells as nuclear donor, which is one of the most well characterized cell line for cybrid studies and the first established human ρ0 cell line. Non-cancerous Cells and their Cybrids Exhibit Better Mitochondrial Functional Properties Compared to Cancer Mitochondria We first analyzed the mitochondrial function of parental mitochondrial donor cell lines and their cybrids. Since the leakage of ROS is an indication of defective mitochondrial function, ROS production was analyzed in all parental cell lines using cell-permeable probe, DCFH-DA. Under metabolic stress, such as in the absence of glucose, cells are forced to solely depend on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy supply. Therefore, if there is defect in mitochondrial respiration, cells are expected to produce increased amount of ROS in the galactose medium. As expected both cancer cell lines (143B and MDA-MB-468) produced significantly higher (p<0.05) ROS in galactose medium compared to glucose medium. However, there was no significant increase in ROS production for MCF10A cells in the galactose medium (Fig. 1A). We then analyzed the cybrids and obtained a similar response as observed with the parental cells. For cybrids with mitochondria from benign MCF10A cells, there was no significant increase in ROS level in galactose medium. However, cybrids with cancer mitochondria showed significantly increased ROS level in galactose medium (Fig. 1B). To further investigate the site of failure in the respiratory chain responsible for the impaired oxidative phosphorylation, the ATP synthesis rates were measured in the presence of complex I substrates (glutamate plus malate), or complex II substrate (succinate). As shown in Fig. 1C, ATP synthesis rates were significantly higher in benign cells compared to the cancer cells in the presence of complex I (p<0.01) or complex II substrates (p<0.01). As expected, cybrid cells also showed similar results for ATP synthesis as observed with the parental cells. In the presence of either complex I substrates or complex II substrates, ATP synthesis rate was markedly increased in 10A/143B cybrids compared to 143B/143B and 468/143B cybrids (p<0.01) (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that cancer mitochondria probably have altered function affecting multiple complexes in the respiratory chain. Western blot analysis showed that compared to cybrids with cancer mitochondria, the mtDNA-encoded mitochondrial complex I ND6 subunit of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase protein was significantly increased in MCF10A/143 cybrids but no difference in nuclear encoded proteins like F1α, Core2 and Ip (Fig. 1E). Thus, introduction of mitochondria from non-cancerous MCF10A could at least partially increase the expression of mtDNA encoded respiratory chain proteins, thus, rectify the reduced mitochondrial function in 143B cancer cell. Non-cancerous Mitochondria can Reverse the Oncogenic Properties of Metastatic Cell To understand the functional significance of mitochondrial retrograde regulation from non-cancerous mitochondria on the tumorigenic properties of a metastatic nucleus, we compared the cybrids for different oncogenic properties. Cell Proliferation and Viability under Hypoxic Condition In solid tumors, cancer cells have the capacity to proliferate and maintain viability under hypoxic conditions due to the reduced vascularization and decreased blood supply in the tumor tissues. We compared the cell proliferation in cybrids under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, even under the uniform nuclear background, cybrids with non-cancerous mitochondria showed significantly decreased cell proliferation in hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2A).  In vitro Tumorigenic Properties The ability to invade cell matrix and to grow under anchorage independent conditions are some of the cancer traits. The nuclear donor 143B osteosarcoma cell line is highly tumorigenic and metastatic in nature. We first analyzed the invasion potential of cybrids using Matrigel invasion chamber. As shown in Fig. 2B, Matrigel invasion assay suggested significantly lower invasion index for 10A/143B cybrids compared to the cybrids with cancer derived mitochondria. We then analyzed the anchorage independent growth potential using in vitro colony formation assay in soft agar. Even under uniform metastatic nuclear background, cybrids containing non-cancerous mitochondria formed significantly less colonies compared to cybrids with cancer mitochondria. The number of colonies in cybrids with moderately metastatic MDA-MB-468 cells was in between the 10A/143B and 143B/143B cybrids (Fig. 2C and D). Resistance to Anticancer Drug Therapy Resistance to cell death from anticancer drug is one of the major causes of cancer treatment failure. Most of the conventional chemotherapeutic agents kill via the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Since doxorubicin is often used in the treatment of solid tumors, including breast, liver, and bone tumors, the cell viability after the anticancer drug treatments was analyzed in cybrids under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Cell viability analysis suggested that compared to 143B/143B and 468/143B cybrids with cancer mitochondria, cybrids containing non-cancerous MCF10A mitochondria had significantly increased cell death after anticancer drug treatment in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2E). The increased cell death after anticancer therapy was further confirmed by the increased expression of apoptotic markers activated caspase 3 and cleaved PARP in doxorubicin treated 10A/143B cybrids (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that mitochondrial characteristics play significant contribution to the response to anticancer drug therapy.  In vivo Tumor Growth The in vitro analyzes strongly suggested the inhibition of oncogenic properties of aggressive 143B cells by the introduction of non-cancerous mitochondria. These findings were further confirmed using an in vivo nude mice model. As expected, all cybrids formed tumors under the highly tumorigenic and metastatic 143B nuclear background. However, as observed with in vitro colony formation assay, the tumor growth was significantly inhibited in 10A/143B cybrids containing non-cancerous mitochondria compared to 143B/143B cybrids with cancerous mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Tumor weight and size were significantly lower in cybrids with mitochondria derived from benign MCF10A cells (Fig. 3B and C). As observed in the in vitro colony formation assay, the tumor size and growth in cybrids with mitochondria derived from moderately cancerous MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were in between the 143B/143B cybrids and 10A/143B cybrids. Altogether, our in vitro and in vivo studies strongly suggest that the mitochondria-nuclear cross talk from non-cancerous mitochondria can inhibit the tumor properties of a highly metastatic cell. Mitochondrial Retrograde Signaling from Benign Mitochondria Suppress Several Oncogenic Pathways Mitochondrial retrograde signaling is a pathway of communication from mitochondria to the nucleus under normal and pathophysiological conditions. To understand the mitochondrial retrograde regulation of nuclear genes by cancerous and non-cancerous mitochondria, we used microarray analysis. Gene expression profiles were compared and bioinformatically analyzed the oncogenic pathways for cybrids with mitochondria from benign breast epithelium (10A/143B) and breast cancer cell (468/143B). Interestingly, even under the same nuclear background, 6478 probe sets representing 4071 unique genes were significantly altered in 10A/143B cybrids compared to 468/143B cybrids (Fig. 4A). Among significantly altered genes, 4794 probe sets representing 2816 unique genes got up-regulated and 1684 probe sets representing 1255 unique genes down regulated in cybrids with MCF10A mitochondria. Further analysis of oncogenic pathways suggest that many oncogenic pathways including RAS, HER2, SRC and P53 pathways are down regulated in MCF10A/143B cybrids with non-cancerous mitochondria (Fig. 4A). Some of the tumor suppressor genes including RB1, PTEN and VHL significantly increased in MCF10A/143B cybrids with benign mitochondria. Microarray data for randomly selected genes were validated by q-RT-PCR analysis (Figure S1). Thus, the microarray analysis strongly suggests that even under a highly aggressive cancer nuclear background, mitochondria-nuclear cross talk from non-cancerous mitochondria can suppress several oncogenic pathways and make the cells less cancerous. Although for more than 3 decades, tumors are regarded as diseases of mutated oncogenes, alternative “metabolic” models also have been proposed to play a role in the development and progression of cancer. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered as one of the most common and consistent phenotypes of cancer cells. In recent years, a growing stream of documents is linking cancer genes with energy metabolism. Numerous differences in the molecular composition of the mitochondrial inner membrane between normal and cancer cells have also been reported. Analysis of the inner membrane lipid composition of various tumor mitochondria has indicated elevated levels of cholesterol, varying total phospholipid content, and/or changes in the amount of individual phospholipids relative to normal controls. Our results demonstrated that even though genes that encode most mitochondrial proteins are located in the nucleus, introduction of mitochondria derived from non-cancerous cell to a cancer nuclear environment resulted in suppression of oncogenic pathways and altered cancer properties. Several reports postulated that ROS might be the mediator of the defective mitochondria in cancer. However, factors other than ROS from cancer mitochondria may also play a role in the tumor characteristics. It is also possible that as observed with cellular reprogramming, mitochondria from different cellular environment may have been programmed in certain way and it can carry over some of its effect to the next generation regardless of the nuclear background. Recent studies have suggested that altered mitochondria can affect epigenetic modifications in nuclear genes including DNA methylation. Such epigenetic alterations including DNA and chromatin modifications and signaling through small RNA may contribute to the maintenance of mitochondria mediated oncogenic transformation for generations. Most of the cybrid studies focused on somatic mutations in mitochondria genome and its functional significance. Many experiments have been conducted to investigate the role of specific mtDNA mutations in cancer. Although somatic mtDNA changes are common features of cancers and some evidence suggests that certain mtDNA mutations do indeed play a function in the development of cancer, the effect of cancer mitochondria on tumorigenesis remains largely unclear. We did not observe any known pathogenic mutational difference between 143B and MCF10A cells. However, although most of the mitochondrial mutations are individually not deleterious, there is a possibility that combination of different levels of mutations collectively may contribute to the protein stability and/or retrograde signaling. Resistance to cell death from anticancer drug is one of the major causes of cancer treatment failure. Most of the conventional chemotherapeutic agents kill via the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis behaves as a critical phenomenon, in which there is a rapid, binary transition from a normally functioning cell to the rapid execution of a program of cell death. A recent exciting study suggested that the differences in response to chemotherapeutic treatment might be due to the differences of pretreatment in the readiness of tumor cells to undergo apoptosis, a measurable property that they call “mitochondrial priming”. According to their finding, differential ‘mitochondrial priming’ is an important mechanism underlying the therapeutic index of conventional chemotherapy. Anti-cancer agents specifically targeting cancer cell mitochondria are named as ‘mitocans’. These structurally distinct molecules that share one unifying feature: they all exert anti-cancer properties based on their ability to induce apoptosis in malignant cells by targeting mitochondria. For example, vitamin E analogues are potent novel anticancer drugs that target mitochondria and act through its pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer activity. Current developments in mitochondria research may provide novel mitocans or allow repositioning some of the already available mitochondria targets for cancer therapy alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs. To conclude, the present study clearly suggests that oncogenic properties of an aggressive cancer cell can at least partially reversed by the cross-talk from a non-cancerous mitochondria by suppressing several oncogenic pathways. The findings and pathways identified in this study open up new avenues to identify novel drug targets as well as to supplement currently available chemotherapeutic drugs with mitochondria targeting agents. Further studies are necessary using the pathways proposed from the microarray analysis and cybrids with non-cancerous or moderate breast cancer nuclear backgrounds.",2293
23304256,"1. Introduction A double-membrane structure and a circular mitochondrial genome with its own transcription, translation, and protein assembly systems support the endosymbiotic origin of the mitochondria. While most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA and imported into the organelle, 13 are encoded by mitochondrial DNA. Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a 16,568 bp circular double-stranded DNA molecule coding for 13 polypeptide components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery, 2 ribosomal RNA molecules, and a set of 22 transfer RNA molecules. More than 99% of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and selectively imported into the appropriate mitochondrial compartment.  Mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally, and each mitochondrion contains 2–10 mtDNA molecules. Mitochondrial DNA has a very high mutation rate and when a mutation occurs, normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA can coexist within the same cell, known as heteroplasmy. Mitochondrial DNA defects are linked with a wide range of diseases known as mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Over the last two decades, more than 100 pathologic defects of mtDNA have been characterized, many due to gross structural rearrangements (i.e., single or multiple deletions or duplications) or from point mutations in the mtDNA. Large-scale deletions of mtDNA in cancer cells imply that deficits in the mitochondrial genome can change cellular behavior similar to cross-talking with nuclear genome. Phylogeographic studies on human mtDNA have revealed a remarkable correlation between mtDNA lineages and the geographic origins of indigenous populations. Regional mtDNA lineages are groups of related individual mtDNA sequences (haplotypes) known as haplogroups. Unique sets of common SNPs define groups of mtDNA (mtDNA haplogroups) that have evolved from the same ancestors. Cann et al. found the mtDNA evolution originated from a common African ancestor, named “mitochondrial Eve”. Haplogroups L1, L2, and L3 are specific for the African population, whereas all non-African mtDNA haplogroups are descended from L3 and belong to either the M or the N superclades. European populations belong to nine haplogroups (i.e., H, I, J, K, T, U, V, W, and X) from the N superclades, while the haplogroups A, B, C, D, and E are specific to Asian populations.  Recently, mtDNA epidemiologic studies have shown that mtDNA haplogroups are associated with various phenotypes. There are significant epidemiologic associations between mtDNA haplogroup and longevity among the Japanese and Chinese, neurodegenerative psychiatric, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. An association between human mtDNA variants and diseases has also been reported. To further confirm the molecular pathogenesis and screen effective treatment for mtDNA-associated diseases, optimal cell models for reproducing the progress of diseases are valuable. A cybrid model that carries the same nuclear background and harbors variant mtDNA can exclude variations from the nuclear genome. Within analogous nuclear background, the physiologic function of mitochondrial genome can be reproduced in vitro, enabling the validation of epidemiologic observations. Thus, a complete set of cybrid cells carrying different mtDNA haplogroups are warranted to exclusively investigate the impact of mtDNA common variations on mitochondrial function. The present study successfully developed the most commonly occurring cybrids harboring mtDNA haplogroups from the Taiwanese population with ethnic Chinese background.  3. Results 3.1. Production of ρ 0 Cells from 143B Osteosarcoma Cells EtBr was bound to the double-helix DNA and inhibited replication. MtDNA was more susceptible to EtBr than nuclear DNA in an indicated concentration of EtBr. Low dosages of EtBr were used for long-term exposure to fully deplete mtDNA while maintaining cellular growth. The reversion of mtDNA in ρ 0 cell in the absence of EtBr was reported to be minimized by prolonged culturing. Thus, instead of shorter durations of EtBr exposure, 143B cells were grown in EtBr for 8 weeks to reduce the possibility of mtDNA reversion. In order to obtain stable clones, individual clones were further isolated. The reversion of mtDNA was examined in the absence of EtBr.  The mtDNA of 143B cells decreased to 0.93 copy/cell after 8 weeks (Table 2). However, mtDNA reversed to the level of the parental 143B cells after EtBr removal for 14 days. The possibility of mtDNA reversion was eliminated by isolating single clones, and six of 16 isolated clones maintained mtDNA; a level of less than one copy per cell after EtBr withdrawal for 50 days. Clone no. 38 was selected for another 60 days of culture without EtBr to confirm the irreversibility of 143B-derived ρ 0 cells (Table 2). The ρ 0 cells died within 4 weeks without pyruvate and uridine (data not shown). 3.2. Loss of Mitochondrial Oxygen Consumption and Defects in Respiratory Enzyme Complexes Since subunit 2 of cytochrome c oxidase (COX2) was mtDNA encoded, COX2 was examined for ρ 0 cells. Immunoblotting demonstrated undetectable COX2 of ρ 0 cells (Figure 1). In terms of oxygen consumption ability of the ρ 0 cells, mitochondrial complex I- and II-linked respiration monitored in the presence of glutamate/malate and succinate, respectively, were deficient in ρ 0 cells (Figure 3).  3.3. Production of Cybrids Harboring Different Haplogroups from Human Platelet Mitochondria Sixteen different haplogroups were selected from healthy volunteers for mitochondrial genotyping. Platelets from the 16 known mtDNA haplogroups were fused with ρ 0 cells, followed by selection. All of the transmitochondrial experiments contained negative control groups in which ρ 0 cells underwent the same fusion process in the absence of human platelets. All of the negative control cells died after selection, while cells fused with platelets survived (data not shown), suggesting that fusion was successful, and the mtDNA of ρ 0 cells were unable to revert.  3.4. Mitochondrial Respiratory Function and Mitochondrial DNA Content Reversed after Transmitochondrial Fusion The mtDNA copy number of parental 143B, ρ 0 cells and cybrids harboring human mtDNA suggested that the depleted mtDNA content in ρ 0 cells was reversed following transmitochondrial fusion (Figure 2). Because most cellular metabolisms relied on normal mitochondria, the respiratory function of the cybrids was examined. Parental 143B cells, ρ 0 cells, and cybrids harboring the B5 haplogroup assayed for oxygen consumption rate indicated that ρ 0 cells with depleted mtDNA demonstrated loss of respiratory function, whereas transmitochondrial fusion successfully restored the lost respiration (Figure 3).  3.5. Mitochondrial Polymorphisms Generated Cybrids Harboring Identical Mitochondrial Genomarkers as the Original Platelet Donors To verify the mtDNA haplogroup of the 16 cybrids, polymorphism sites were reexamined by Luminex 1000. All 16 cybrids had similar mtDNA haplogroups as their original donors (data not shown). To further verify the mtDNA haplogroup of these constructed cybrids, full-length sequencing for mtDNA was performed. Nonsynonymous sites in mtDNA genome caused amino acid substitution in the 16 cybrids (Tables 3 and 4), showing characterizations of the genetic aspect and corresponding features of the amino acid.  3.6. Cybrids with Various mtDNA Haplogroups Exhibited Differences in Oxygen Consumption Capacity and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Haplogroups N9a and D4a were reported to be protective against diabetes and promoted longevity, respectively. Haplogroup B4 was diabetes susceptible, while haplogroup D4 was diabetes-resistant. To clarify if mtDNA genetic variations among these haplogroups influenced mitochondrial respiratory capacity, cellular oxygen consumption rates were examined in cell lines created from these haplogroups. Cybrid-harboring mtDNA haplogroups N9a and D4a had significantly higher oxygen consumption rates compared to cybrid-harboring mtDNA haplogroups B4b, F1a, B5, and D5a in complex I- and II-linked respiration (Figure 4(a)). Moreover, compared to cybrid-harboring mtDNA haplogroup B4b, haplogroups F1a, B5, and D5a also exhibited higher O2 consumption rates in complex I-linked respiration.  Measuring mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) among these cybrid lines, the ΔΨm of cybrid-harboring mtDNA haplogroups B4b and F1a was significantly higher compared to those of B5, D5a, D4a, and N9a (Figure 4(b)). This was consistent with a previous report that a cybrid with higher oxygen consumption rate had lower mitochondrial membrane potential. 3.7. Cybrids Harboring Different mtDNA Haplogroups Exhibited Discriminating Tolerance against Oxidative Stress To assess whether differences in OXPHOS capacity affected cellular tolerance to oxidative stress, the viability of cybrid cells exposed to various doses of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was examined. Under higher H2O2 concentration, cybrids-harboring mtDNA haplogroups F1a, D4a, and N9a had significant resistance and higher cellular viability compared to B4b (Figure 5), suggesting that cybrid B4b was much more sensitive to oxidative stress induced by H2O2. Notably, cybrid-harboring mtDNA haplogroup N9a demonstrated superior viability under oxidative stress compared to those with B4b, F1a, B5, D5a, and D4a.",1372

25553469,"2. INTRODUCTION Mitochondria play a role in several cellular processes. They are important for buffering calcium and controlling the production of ROS. They can initiate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c, but arguably their most important function is in the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. To do this, mitochondria use four complexes, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I), succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex II), ubiquinone-cytochrome-c oxidoreductase (Complex III), and cytochrome-c-oxidase (Complex IV) to generate an electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane which is then used to power the conversion of ADP to ATP by ATP synthase (Complex V). The textbook model of these complexes as separate, free floating entities which use cytochrome c and ubiquinone as electron carriers between them has slowly been rethought in recent years. The mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) is now thought to contain functional supercomplexes (SCs) which are formed by individual complexes coming together in various ratios to form stable, supra-molecular structures. How these SCs are assembled and what their function is has been an intense debate. Though there is criticism that these SCs may just be an artifact that are only observed because of milder detergents like digitonin, this has largely been abated by evidence that these SCs are enzymatically active. The plasticity model envisions the MRC as a combination of free complexes and SCs which are able to adapt to changing conditions. It accounts for lower SCs (I/III and III/IV) which may act as intermediates to the I/III/IV SC or may have functions of their own. What this means however in terms of how the assembly of SCs is regulated and what roles they may play under different conditions has yet to be explored. 3. SUPERCOMPLEX ASSEMBLY Much of the work in recent years has focused on understanding the assembly of SCs and the discovery of SC assembly factors. It was determined that Complex I was dependent on both Complex III and Complex IV though neither complex was affected when Complex I was deficient. These evidences led to the theory that Complex I assembly was dependent on SC assembly and that SC assembly should therefore follow the assembly of individual complexes. This process has major biomedical implications and helps explain threshold effects seen in mtDNA mutations. When wildtype mtDNA of either Complex III or Complex IV is depleted there is initially no effect on respiration due to excess amounts of Complex III and Complex IV. When the reserves of these complexes are depleted however the I/III2/IVn SCs are unable to assemble. At this point respiration rapidly diminishes. The timing however of SC assembly has been a matter of contention however. In mouse fibroblast cells, (35S) methionine-labeled mtDNA subunits were observed to assemble into individual complexes and then into various SCs. In contrast, a study in Neurospora crassa observed that the III/IV SC can assemble separately from Complex I, that Complex III and Complex IV interact with the membrane arm of Complex I, and that this interaction is important for the full assembly of Complex I. Later work supported these observations by depleting the OXPHOS complexes with doxycycline treatment and then monitoring the assembly of complexes by blue-native gel electrophoresis. They observed that Complex I assembly occurred as previously reported up to an 830 KDa intermediate which they deemed the first SC intermediate. At this point Complex III and then Complex IV subunits begin to attach to the membrane arm of Complex I. The final step in this process involves the attachment of the catalytic subunits NDUFS4 and NDUFV1 of Complex I before activation of the I/III2/IVn SC (Figure 1). SC assembly factors have recently been the focus of most studies on SCs. Originally the existence of SC assembly factors was only theoretical. It was proposed that either SCs share assembly factors with the individual complexes particularly in the case of Complex I whose late stage assembly factor NDUFAF2 interacts with the 830 KDa subcomplex in the insertion of the N module or SCs may have their own exclusive set of assembly factors which when lost affect only the levels of SCs but not the levels of individual complexes. These two ideas may not be mutually exclusive in the sense that there may be a set of factors common to individual complexes and SCs as well as a set that is exclusive to SCs. In terms of classification though, it is simpler to keep the two separate and only label the second class as bona fide SC assembly factors. For the purpose of expanding current knowledge of SC dynamics the identification of true SC assembly factors is of paramount importance to allow researchers the ability to modulate SC assembly under various conditions. The biomedical significance of SC assembly factors is best exemplified by cardiolipin and its role in Barth Syndrome. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid which is primarily found in mitochondrial membranes. It is necessary for the maintenance of membrane potential, ATP synthesis, and mitochondrial function. Barth syndrome is an X-linked disorder which presents with cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and neutropenia and is caused by a mutation in the taffazin (TAZ) gene which is responsible for the remodeling of cardiolipin. It was known that cardiolipin is essential for electron transfer between Complex I and Complex III and that cardiolipin was necessary for the formation of the III/IV SC, but the link between cardiolipin, SCs, and Barth Syndrome was not established until a landmark study by McKenzie et al in 2006 which demonstrated that SCs particularly the I/III2/IV SC were destabilized in Barth Syndrome. Additionally it was biochemically determined that cardiolipin has binding sites for Complexes I, III, IV, and V. To compensate for the changes in the MRC, it was shown by electron microscopy that there is an increase in mitochondrial mass in Barth Syndrome which prevents a dramatic decrease in respiration, but there is also loss of intrinsic apoptosis signaling. Taken collectively these studies establish a precedent for understanding SCs in terms of their possible biomedical significance. In 2012, two proteins renamed rcf-1 and rcf-2 were shown in yeast to interact with Complex IV and indirectly with Complex III. Additionally this interaction is necessary for the formation of the III/IV SC (Figure 1). The function of these proteins was previously unknown except that they are important for maintaining mitochondrial function. This would suggest that rcf-1 and rcf-2 are SC assembly factors, but because rcf-1 is required for the assembly of Cox13 into Complex IV and for rcf-2 assembly into SCs, it may be more appropriate at least for rcf-1 to categorize them as general Complex IV assembly factors. The mammalian orthologs of these proteins are the hypoxia-induced genes HIG1A and HIG2A. Knockdown of HIG1A has no effect on the level of SCs, but loss of HIG2A reduced the levels of all SCs containing Complex IV without a reduction in the amount of free Complex IV. Therefore regardless of classification, rcf-1 and rcf-2 are important players in SC assembly. In contrast, the cochaperone MCJ/DnaJC15 was discovered to act as a negative regulator of mitochondrial respiration. MCJ localizes at the inner mitochondrial membrane where it interacts with free Complex I and inhibits the formation of SCs. When MCJ is lost there is an increase in ATP production, membrane potential, and Complex I activity possibly due to its incorporation into SCs. There is not however an increase in ROS which would normally accompany these increases which may be explained by the increase in SC formation. Interestingly under altered metabolic conditions such as fasting or high-cholesterol diets, the loss of MCJ prevents lipid accumulation and steatosis by favoring lipid metabolism and glycogenesis in the liver. This example provides evidence of the importance of SC assembly in response to altered metabolic conditions. The first true SC assembly factor identified in mammalian cells was identified by proteomic analysis of MRC bands on a blue-native gel. The protein Cox7a2l was present in I/III/IV SCs and III/IV SCs, but not free complexes. This protein was also found to be mutated in several common mouse lines. The mutation caused a short, unstable version of Cox7a2l which ablated the interaction between Complexes III and IV. The protein was renamed SC assembly factor 1 (SCAF1). Without SCAF1, Complex IV will not assemble into SCs; with SCAF1, Complex IV can assemble into the III/IV SC and the I/III/IV SC (Figure 1). This effectively creates three pools of Complex IV: one receiving electrons exclusively from NADH in the I/III/IV SC, one exclusively from FADH2 in the III/IV SC, and fee Complex IV which can receive electrons from either carrier. This segmentation may prevent competitive inhibition and allow the cell to maximize oxidation of multiple substrates by adjusting the SC composition of its MRC. To demonstrate this, mice with and without the SCAF1 mutation were subjected to 18 hours of starvation to activate fatty acid oxidation. In fatty acid oxidation the ratio between NADH and FADH2 decreases, creating a situation where the mitochondria would need to maximize their ability to utilize FADH2. Accordingly after starvation it was observed that the SCAF1+ mice had a reduction in the amount of Complex III associating with Complex I. Additionally pyruvate and malate driven respiration decreased while succinate driven respiration increased. These results indicate that when FA oxidation is activated, the NADH only I/III/IV SC is decreased allowing for maximized oxidation of FADH2 through the III/IV SC and free Complexes III and IV pathways. This study demonstrates that metabolic changes can affect the composition of SCs. It is worth noting however that in this model it is necessary for cytochrome c to demonstrate pool behavior acting both as a channeled substrate in SCs and as a free-diffusing substrate to interact with free Complex IV. This pool behavior is still under debate. Electron microscopy has revealed binding sites for cytochrome c with a diffusion distance less than 10 nm supporting the ability of cytochrome c as a channeled substrate. Evidence in yeast however demonstrated that the observed pool behavior of cytochrome c is artificially introduced by the use of chaotropic agents that disassociate the individual complexes from a single unit respiratory complex and thus does not exist under physiological conditions. 4. SUPERCOMPLEX PLASTICITY AND METABOLISM One important question that is only just starting to be answered is whether or not a cell’s SC composition is fixed or if it can change over time or in response to different stimuli. The “plasticity” of SCs may have biomedical implications in that the loss of SC plasticity may either be an indicator of or directly cause pathologies. Therefore study of the mechanisms and regulation of SC plasticity may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for treating mitochondrial dysfunction. The lipid content of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is especially important for maintenance of SCs. The OXPHOS proteins in the IMM are densely packed so that the average distance between complexes is only a few nanometers. At low integral protein concentrations, the proteins are randomly dispersed in the IMM. Counterintuitively as the protein concentration increases it becomes more entropically favorable for the integral proteins to aggregate into SCs because lipids bound to the proteins are able to return to the disorganized lipid pool. Outer membrane-inner membrane contacts and the tubular connections of cristae also favor immobilization of integral proteins. Additionally matrix enzymes are able to bind to respiratory chain complexes particularly Complex I which is known to interact with the NAD-linked dehydrogenases: pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and beta-hydroxyacyle-CoA dehydrogenase forming a “metabolome” where electrons can pass straight from the dehydrogenases through the ETC. Furthermore lipid peroxidation causes many changes in the lipid bilayer including the breakdown of lipid-protein interactions possibly decreasing the stability of SCs. As described previously, cardiolipin is important for the stabilization of SCs. It was biochemically determined that the formation of the I/III complex is determined by the concentration of phospholipids in that an increase in phospholipids beyond a certain threshold leads to more free complexes. In contrast, cardiolipin concentration is important to keep SCs stable. In a yeast mutant lacking cardiolipin the III2/IV2 SC was present but less stable than in the parent strain, and this instability couldn’t be rescued by an increase in other phospholipids including phosphatidylthanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol indicating that they could not substitute for cardiolipin. It was later determined that lack of PE actually stabilizes SCs. In yeast mutants lacking PE there was a loss of membrane potential, defects in protein import, a decrease in respiration and Complex IV activity, but lack of PE also increased the assembly of III/IV SCs. These studies indicate that lipid composition of the IMM is important for the formation and stability of SCs. Therefore it appears that there is a very delicate balance between the protein/lipid ratio and SCs in the IMM in that the overall concentration of lipids must be low enough to favor protein aggregation and thus SC formation but the concentration of cardiolipin specifically must be high enough (and therefore the concentration of other phospholipids low enough) to sufficiently stabilize SCs after their assembly. Membrane potential may also be responsible for regulating SC assembly. Studies on membrane potential control on respiration observed that in the uncoupled condition Complex IV has a low reserve capacity and a large control coefficient which is lost once the mitochondrial electrochemical potential is established. It was suggested that a high membrane potential would indicate a low energy demand for the cell. The respirasome would then break apart into individual complexes causing a decrease in oxygen consumption. As ATP is used, the membrane potential would decrease and the respirasome would reform to satisfy the requirement for a higher rate of respiration. Similarly low mitochondrial pH and hypoxia were shown in plants to induce Complex I to disassociate from the I/III/IV SC causing an increase in the III/IV SC. The changes observed under hypoxia are especially interesting in regards to cancer and the Warburg effect. It may be that during early stages of cancer, hypoxia causes a loss of SCs as the cell switches from OXPHOS to glycolysis based metabolism. On the macro level a few processes have been identified as necessary for SC stability. The fission/fusion cycle as well as mitophagy are important quality control mechanisms for the cell. Defects in these processes have been linked with pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease. During fusion, cristae reorganization requires that the SCs are disassembled and then reassembled. Two factors, OPA1 and mitofilin are required for maintaining tight cristae junctions. By modulating the expression of OPA1, it was discovered that SC assembly requires intact cristae junctions. Interestingly mutations in OPA1 can cause dominant optic atrophy, an optic nerve degeneration disease characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells. In a study of a mouse model of this disease, premature age-related axonal and myelin degenerations, increased mitophagy, and SC instability followed by degeneration and cell death were observed. Further research into the relationship between these quality control mechanisms and SC stability may therefore elucidate possible therapeutic targets for disease. Post-translational modification of proteins is an important process for quickly and transiently modifying the structure of a protein causing changes in enzyme activity as well as interfering or aiding protein-protein interactions. To date no work has specifically analyzed the role of post-translational modifications in SC assembly or function, but there is a large body of information on post-translational modifications of individual respiratory complexes and other mitochondrial proteins. Three NAD-dependent deacetylases; SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5; are localized to the mitochondria. SIRT3 in particular has been implicated in regulating metabolism by deacetylating the Complex I subunit NDUFA9 to maintain ATP levels as well as matrix proteins like the mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRPL10 to regulate protein synthesis and the SdhA subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II) demonstrating the role of acetylation/deacetylation in regulating oxidative phosphorylation. Phosphorylation modification of respiratory complexes provides an exciting link through kinase cascades between changes in a cell’s environment such as endocrine signaling molecules like insulin and glucagon and changes in the MRC. Kinases and phosphatases for both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues are present in mitochondria. The activity of Complex I as well as its ROS generating capacity have been linked to phosphorylation. Protein kinase A, a cAMP-dependent kinase, is known to phosphorylate the Complex I subunits NDUSF7, NDUFA1, and NDUFS4. Phosphorylation of NDUFS4 is required for import of this subunit into mitochondria. These phosphorylation events lead to stabilization of Complex I and a decrease in ROS generation. Phosphorylation of NDUSF7 by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase however has the opposite effect. Complex IV phosphorylation however has had conflicting results. The Complex IV subunit COX-I is phosphorylated at Tyrosine-304 after an increase in cAMP which causes a loss of COX activity. This residue is near the interaction of this subunit with COX-II and may enhance monomer-monomer interaction. This is the site of interaction between Complex IV and its partners in the I/III2/IV SC and may explain the prevalence of cAMP/PKA dependent phosphorylation in free Complex IV. Other PKA phosphorylation sites in Complex IV which may affect its ability to bind with other proteins were found in subunits II, III, IV, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIc, and VIII. Contrastingly phosphorylation of COXI and COX IVb was shown to increase respiration and reduce ROS. The study also identified a soluable-adenylate cyclase specific to mitochondria that is activated by bicarbonate produced by CO2 generated in the TCA cycle which when inhibited reversed the phosphorylation at these sites as well as the changes in mitochondrial function. Regardless of the conflicting results, it is clear that phosphorylation particularly by PKA is important for regulation of oxidative phosphorylation. Whether or not this regulation also acts on the level of SCs has yet to be explored. 5. SUPERCOMPLEXES, ROS AND AGING The mitochondrial theory of aging predicts that over time oxidative stress causes mtDNA mutations leading to a loss in the integrity of respiratory machinery. This loss of integrity inevitably causes an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn cause mtDNA mutations in a vicious cycle leading to an overall decline in mitochondrial function (Figure 2). This loss of bioenergetic function is predicted to be the cause of aging and age-associated degenerative diseases. The majority of ROS produced by the mitochondria comes from Complexes I and III with Complex I being the major contributor. ROS can have multiple damaging effects besides causing mtDNA mutations. They can oxidize the complexes themselves or cause peroxidation of phospholipids which leads to a dramatic loss of cardiolipin content. Additionally ROS has been shown to increase with age. It has been proposed that SCs help decrease the production of ROS by substrate channeling, which limits the amount of electron leakage, as well as the sequestering of vulnerable sites which protects the complexes from oxidative damage. A recent study discovered that mtSODs interact directly with the I/III/IV SC and may protect it from oxidative damage. SCs have been observed to decline with age in the rat heart. In rat skeletal muscle, the levels of CI, CIII, and CV in old rats was significantly less than in young rats, but though there was a decrease in lower molecular weight SCs, there was an increase in higher molecular weight SCs. This may be a compensatory mechanism to prevent further ROS generation and oxidative damage. Similarly a cytochrome b p.278Y to C mutation causes an increase in superoxide production and a decrease in the III2 and III2/IV SCs but an increase in the I/III2/IVn SCs. This switch to higher order SCs (SCs of higher molecular weights with greater stoichiometric ratios of complexes e.g. the I/III2/IVn is a higher order SC compared to the III2IV) may act as a way to contain Complex I which most likely produces more ROS in its free state. It is tempting to predict that over time with enough oxidative damage, it’s possible that these higher order SCs will become unstable and release Complex I thereby increasing ROS production (Figure 2), but further study is needed to determine if this process occurs and if the switch to higher molecular weight SCs is in fact a compensatory mechanism to reduce ROS or just a result of certain SCs being more susceptible to aging. In particular the main function of the I/III2 SC may be to limit the production of ROS from Complex I. A study in rat cortex observed an age-associated 40% decline in SCs containing Complex I which was predominately caused by the 58% decline in I/III2 SCs. Recently Maranzana et al investigated this relationship. The site of electron escape from Complex I is controversial, but two main sites have been proposed: FMN or the iron sulfur cluster N2. The N2 site may be predominant when CI is present in SCs while FMN may only become available after CI isolation when its loss of stability may cause the FMN site to become free to interact with oxygen. Maranzana et al investigated the I/III2 SC in two different systems, bovine heart mitochondria and reconstituted proteoliposomes composed of CI and CIII at different lipid: protein ratios. When the bovine heart mitochondria were treated with DDM, a detergent which causes the complexes in SCs to disassociate, there was a decrease in efficient energy transfer and an increase in ROS. Similarly proteoliposomes in a high lipid: protein ratio (30:1) which prevented I/III2 assembly had enhanced ROS generation compared to proteoliposomes in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment of the 1:1 ratio proteoliposomes with DDM caused an increase in ROS due to the disassociation of CI from the I/III2 SC. This study is the first of its kind to directly demonstrate the relationship between the loss of SCs and an increase in ROS production from CI. How this increase in ROS relates to aging and the possibility of modulating this process is an exciting area of research in the SC field.",3624

Introduction 1.1 Reactive Oxygen Species Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a group of radical or non-radical oxygen containing molecules that display high reactivity with lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Depending on the concentration, location, and molecular context, ROS can be beneficial or harmful to cells. Increasing evidence indicates that homeostatic and physiological levels of ROS are indispensable in regulating diverse cellular processes, including ion channel/transporter function, Ca2+ spark production, protein kinase/phosphatase activation and gene expression. A current view is that low levels of ROS production contribute to many essential intracellular signaling processes ranging from cell metabolism to ischemia preconditioning in eukaryotic cells. Conversely, excessive ROS generation often leads to apoptotic and necrotic cell death as well as to a panel of clinically distinct disorders, including neurodegeneration (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease), cardiomyopathies, diabetes and cancer. Accumulative and systemic ROS damages also underlie cell senescence and aging. In quiescent cells, ROS are primarily produced as byproducts of mitochondrial respiration when electrons leak from the electron transport chain (ETC) (Fig. 1). Superoxide anions (O2.−) are the primary ROS species generated by the ETC, and are converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) either spontaneously or by the superoxide dismutase (SOD). In the presence of transition metals, O2.− can also be transformed into hydroxyl radicals (.OH) that are considered to be more reactive and damaging. Recent studies documented that massive increases in localized ROS production could occur during metabolic stress and photostimulation. Besides, excessive amounts of intracellular ROS ultimately contribute to necrotic or apoptotic cell death. 1.2 Oxidized and Reduced Quinones Quinone molecules (oxidized Q/reduced QH2) play a central role in O2.− generation because they act as direct electron donors/acceptors, or redox mediators, to reduce molecular oxygen (O2). They are present in energy transducing membranes in large amounts as compared with other components of the respiratory chain, and serve as intermediates during electron transfer reactions connecting together ETC complexes (Fig. 1). The redox chemistry of Q/QH2 is reversible, fast, and involves two consecutive “one-electron” reduction steps via a semiquinone radical (SQ.−) intermediate. While this property of Q/QH2 is important during energy transduction to store reducing equivalents, it also constitutes a liability for ROS generation, especially when Q/QH2 catalysis is not well confined to specific niches in related proteins. This process is often referred to as the ‘leakage of electrons’ from the ETC complexes. In addition to their redox functions, QH2 molecules can also reduce O2 via a “one-electron” reduction step leading to the formation of O2.−, which is the main source of ROS in cells. However, direct oxidation of QH2 by O2 is slow and spin-forbidden, whereas the redox reactions between SQ.− and O2 ultimately yielding O2.− can be very fast. These reactions strongly depend on how well SQ.− binds to its site of generation as well as the redox potential of the Q/SQ.− couple, thus on the stability constant and local factors modulating its disproportionation. As O2 partitions favorably into the lipid phase, co-partitioning would allow O2 and SQ.− to react effectively unless the latter species is sequestered away from accessing O2. The local concentration and stability of SQ.− have been optimized during evolution in the case of the ETC complexes that perform Q/QH2 redox chemistry. It is also noteworthy that the reaction leading to O2.− production is reversible, which allows Q to be used as a protective agent against oxidative damages by consuming O2.− radicals. 1.3 Production of ROS by ETC Although still subject to controversy, it is believed that ROS are produced in the cell mainly during perturbations of respiratory chain functions. Increased supply of electrons to ETC, (e. g., excess of reducing equivalents) or enhanced membrane potential generation lead to an increase of SQ.− content in membranes, and subsequently, to higher O2.− production. Moreover, kinetic constraints exerted downstream of the Q pool (e. g., blocking electron flow at the level of cytochrome c oxidase, CIV) further enhance production of SQ.−. Conversely, moderate uncoupling of the membrane potential decreases the electron flux constraints across ETC therefore descreasing O2.− production by the respiratory complexes (Fig. 1). Both of these effects can also be observed upon modification of the respiratory chain by specific chemicals. For example, free fatty acids exert different effects on mitochondria in respect to ROS generation: they inhibit electron flux through the complex I (CI), and probably the complex III (CIII), by inducing an increase of ROS production as seen in isolated rat heart or liver mitochondria. Fatty acids also induce an uncoupling effect, which seems responsible for a large decrease in ROS formation. Thus, ROS production is fine-tuned in response to changes in electron flux through ETC. The respiratory complexes CI and CIII were well known for some time to be involved directly in superoxide production (Fig. 1). More recently, complex II (CII) is implicated in this process as well. It has been suggested that about 2–5% of O2 consumed might lead to O2.− generation, of which roughly 70–80% is linked to the mechanism of function of CIII based on quantitative data obtained using isolated mitochondria. However O2.− production measurements depend on the cell type, respiration steady-state, materials and techniques used to quantify the chemical free radicals. More conservative predictions estimate that O2.− production by ETC is perhaps only 0.1% of physiological respiratory rates. 2. Complex III (CIII or cytochrome bc1) 2.1 Structure and mechanism of function of CIII CIII is a major multi-subunit, membrane-bound enzyme that is central to respiratory energy transduction pathways in many organisms. In different species, it enzymatically converts various derivatives of QH2 to Q, and reduces various mobile or membrane-anchored electron carriers, typically c-type cytochromes. CIII operates via the Q-cycle mechanism, and contributes to the formation of both the membrane potential and the proton gradient used for ATP production by ATP synthase (or complex V, CV). Depending on the species, mitochondrial CIII contains up to eleven subunits, of which eight are not essential for enzymatic activity (referred to as the “supernumerary subunits”). These subunits are absent in most bacterial CIII, which usually contain only three subunits as the essential catalytic core of the enzyme (Fig. 2a). Due to their structural simplicity and evolutionarily conserved sequence and structure, the facultative phototrophic bacteria (Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodobacter sphaeroides) and Paracoccus denitrificans are widely used organisms as CIII models for their mitochondrial counterparts. The three universally conserved catalytic subunits of CIII are the cytochrome b, the Fe/S (also called the Rieske) protein and cytochrome c1. Cytochrome b is an integral membrane protein, whereas the Fe/S protein and cytochrome c1 are membrane-anchored by their amino- and carboxyl-terminal helices, respectively. These three subunits carry specific cofactors that are required for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. These cofactors are two b-type hemes (axially coordinated protophorphyrin IX-iron) with one low (bL) and one high (bH) Em of cytochrome b, the [2Fe-2S] cluster with a high redox midpoint potential (Em) of the Fe/S protein, and a high Em c-type heme (covalently bound protophorphyrin IX-iron) of cytochrome c1 (Fig. 2a). Most bacterial and mitochondrial purified CIII form dimers, and their three-dimensional structures depict these proteins as symmetrical homodimers. In the case of R. capsulatus CIII, monomeric forms of the enzyme are neither active nor stable. However, tetrameric forms of bacterial CIII have been reported in at least two instances. In R. capsulatus, upon fusion of cytochrome c1 with its physiological electron carrier cytochrome cy, formation of active CIII tetramers was observed. The P. denitrificans native enzyme forms tetramers, but elimination of a naturally present amino-terminal extension of cytochrome c1 was reported to yield dimeric CIII. Each monomer of the bacterial enzyme contains the three catalytic subunits in an unusual organization. Cytochrome b with its eight transmembrane helices forms the membrane-embedded core to which the other two subunits are bound. Facing the lipid layer on cytochrome b, two Q/QH2 binding (QH2 oxidation (Qo) and Q reduction (Qi)) sites are located on the positive (p) and negative (n) sides of the membrane. The carboxyl-terminal helix of cytochrome c1 interacts closely with the fifth helix of cytochrome b to form a cytochrome b-c1 core, which interacts with the mobile head domain of the Fe/S protein, leaving its amino terminal membrane helix (i. e., tail) associated with cytochrome b of the other monomer. In agreement with this organization, a stable dimeric cytochrome b-c1 subcomplex has been purified from R. capsulatus. Reconstitution of this subcomplex into an active enzyme was achieved when a full-length Fe/S protein was used, but not with a truncated Fe/S protein lacking its amino-terminal tail domain. The mobility of the Fe/S protein head domain between cytochrome b and cytochrome c1 and its [2Fe-2S] cluster is essential for CIII activity. According to the proton-motive Q-cycle mechanism, upon the diffusion of a QH2 molecule from the Q-pool to the Qo site of CIII, the oxidized [2Fe-2S] cluster of the Fe/S protein oxidizes this QH2 and conveys a single electron via its mobile head domain to oxidized cytochrome c1. This electron is then transferred down the ETC to a terminal oxidase (e. g., CIV). The highly unstable SQ.− radical thus produced at the Qo site gives an electron to heme bL of cytochrome b, which rapidly transfers it to heme bH across the lipid bilayer, to generate membrane potential and a stable SQ.− at the Qi site. Completion of the catalytic turnover of CIII involves a second QH2 oxidation at the Qo site of the dimeric CIII, via the same sequence of events described above, converting SQ.− at the Qi site to a QH2 to be released from the enzyme. The Qo and Qi sites of CIII are not identical with respect to their ability to interact with the SQ.− species. While the SQ.− at the Qi site is well characterized by EPR spectroscopy, SQ.− at the Qo site is a subject of controversy. It is difficult to detect the latter species experimentally, and it was only seen under specific conditions at extremely low amounts. Moreover, no structural information is yet available about the exact position of Q/QH2 at the Qo site. Thus, detailed descriptions of the events that follow QH2 oxidation by the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the Fe/S protein until the transfer of the second electron to heme bL of cytochrome b remain unknown. 2.2 Superoxide production at the Qo site Importance of the structural integrity of bacterial CIII for maximal rate of catalysis and minimal rate of electron leakage to O2 is known. Heat-inactivated or proteinase K digested CIII, and catalytically impaired mutants producing higher amounts of O2.− have been reported. Bifurcated electron transfer from QH2 to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the Fe/S protein and to the heme bL of cytochrome b at the Qo site infers that either preventing the formation of a SQ.−, or entrapping it within CIII to avoid its interaction with O2, should prevent O2.− production. Conditions favoring the generation of SQ.− should enhance O2.− production as analyzed in detail by Oscyzka et al.,. Two different situations leads to SQ.− generation: a semiforward electron pathway that produces a SQ.− following oxidation of QH2 by the Fe/S protein, and a semireverse electron transfer pathway that involves electron transfer from reduced heme bL of cytochrome b to a Q bound at the Qo site to yield a SQ.−(referred to as “forward” and “reverse” for simplicity) (Fig. 1). 2.2.1 Forward electron transfer for SQ.− generation at the Qo site of CIII Earlier studies focused mainly on the production of O2.− at the Qo site via the forward electron transfer pathway. Historically, the pioneering work of Chance proposed that the residual cytochrome c reduction activity seen when CIII is inhibited with antimycin A was closely associated with O2.− production. Accordingly, both electrons from QH2 oxidation would be transferred to the electron carrier cytochrome c, but via two disparate pathways. One electron would be delivered to cytochrome c via the high-potential chain (i. e., the Fe/S protein and cytochrome c1), while the other electron would be conveyed to O2 to yield O2.− which would rapidly oxidize cytochrome c. Later on, occurrence of this process was supported by the fact that chemical destruction of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the Fe/S protein or maintenance of this cluster in a reduced state inhibited O2.− formation. Similarly, inhibiting reduction of Q at the Qi site (e. g., using antimycin A) significantly increased Qo site mediated O2.− production. Studies of the effects of specific Qo and Qi site inhibitors on O2.− production described the complementary bypass reactions in details. For instance, decreasing the rate of electron transfer between the hemes bL and bH of cytochrome b, or abolishing the subsequent oxidation of these hemes via the Qi site inhibitor antimycin A, resulted in the accumulation of electrons on cytochrome b. This led to the accumulation of SQ.− at the Qo site and to the leak of electrons to O2 to generate O2.−. In general, if a SQ.− is formed at the Qo site (i. e., via a non concerted electron bifurcation) during the normal turn over of a native CIII, O2.− production is expected to be quite low to minimize electron leakage and energy waste. However, O2.− production at the Qo site might become significant under compromising conditions, such as a highly reduced Q pool, presence of antimycin A-like molecules inhibiting oxidation of reduced b hemes of cytochrome b, extremely high membrane potential, or specific Qo site mutations (see section 3). Such conditions may occur in damaged CIII enzymes, or under extreme physiological situations (e. g., ischemia and reperfusion). Recently, a variant of the forward electron transfer pathway was proposed for R. sphaeroides CIII. In contrast to the earlier studies, this model postulated that under physiological conditions, O2.− production is not the result of a bypass reaction during the Q-cycle, but is a regulatory step for enhancing Qo site catalysis. The authors entertained the idea that O2 might act as a redox mediator during oxidation of QH2 and reduction of heme bL of cytochrome b. Accordingly, O2.− formation and CIII activity would increase together as a function of O2 concentration available during the assay conditions. However, the relevance and validity of the relatively mild effects (< 2 fold) observed on enzyme activity require additional investigations. 2.2.2 Reverse electron transfer for SQ.− generation at the Qo site of CIII In recent years, several studies focused on the bypass reactions of the Q-cycle yielding O2.− production via a reverse electron transfer pathway. It appears that partial oxidation of the Q pool in a physiologically relevant scenario significantly increases the rates of O2.− production by antimycin A inhibited CIII. Using submitochondrial particles, Dröse and Brandt observed that CIII mediated ROS production was higher when CII activity was partially inhibited by malonate (or oxaloacetate), linking the Q pool redox state to O2.− production via the Qo site of CIII. They proposed that the O2.− thus generated was produced at the Qo site by reverse electron transfer from reduced heme bL of cytochrome b to O2 via a SQ.− intermediate acting as a redox mediator. Quinlan et al (2011) further supported this proposal showing that this effect might be directly driven by the redox state of hemes bL and bH of cytochrome b that are sensitive to the Q pool redox state and membrane potential. Additional studies using bacterial CIII mutants indicated that O2.− production at the Qo site also involved reverse electron transfer from reduced heme bL of cytochrome b, and Osyczka’s group proposed a “kinetic” mechanism to account for its occurrence. Accordingly, the movement of the Fe/S protein [2Fe-2S] cluster from the Qo site increased O2.− generation, whereas its stagnation at the Qo site decreased it. This observation correlated the production of ROS with the position of the Fe/S protein head domain on cytochrome b. Assuming that the movement of the reduced Fe/S protein is not obligatorily “concerted” with electron transfer from SQ.− to cytochrome bL heme, ROS generation could be rationalized as the result of a kinetic competition between the internal reactions involving the cofactors of CIII, the Q residing at the Qo site, and the reaction of SQ.− with O2. 3. Defective CIII catalysis and enhanced ROS production due to specific mutations 3.1 Bacterial CIII mutations and ROS production Studies using bacterial CIII also highlighted some specific amino acid residues as key contributors for affecting ROS production. For instance, the M183K or M183L substitutions in R. capsulatus cytochrome c1 drastically decreased the Em of heme c1,severely impeding electron flow kinetics through the high potential chain of CIII, and enhancing O2.− production during Q0 site catalysis. In a recent study, Lee et al (2011) described a different role played by some amino acid residues of cytochrome b in controlling O2.− production via the Qo site of the bacterial CIII (Fig. 2b). In R. capsulatus, substitution of the conserved Y302 of cytochrome b with any other amino acid residue decreased CIII activity. Concomitantly, it increased O2.− production independently of antimycin A inhibition or other treatments known to enhance this process. These findings indicated that some cytochrome b residues are critical for suppressing ROS production at the Qo site of the enzyme. Various structures have depicted this tyrosine side chain in slightly different H-bonding patterns, depending on the position of the Fe/S protein head domain and the occupant of the Qo site. Moreover, the hydroxyl group of this residue is within H-bonding distance from a cluster of H2O molecules in a high resolution structure. Although it is unclear how Y302X (X being any amino acid) mutations enhance mechanistically O2.− production, the finding that even the Y302F substitution increases O2.− production suggests that it may be linked to the loss of the fixed H2O cluster coordinated in the native enzyme by the hydroxyl group of Y302. Accordingly, any mutant losing the hydroxyl group would exhibit decreased CIII activity due to the incorrect positioning of the Fe/S protein head domain. Concomitantly, it would also produce increased O2.− due to the uncoordinated mobility of the Fe/S protein head domain vis-a-vis the electron transfer from SQ.− to cytochrome bL, and the ensuing undesirable electron leakage to O2 during Qo site catalysis. The counterparts of R. capsulatus Y302 in other species, in particular the malarial (Y268), yeast (Y279) and human (Y278C) mitochondrial mutants were also studied with respect to decreased CIII catalysis and enhanced ROS production,. Decreased CIII activities were reported for all mutants, and enhanced O2.− production was described for several yeast and human mutants (see below). The overall findings indicate that a number of amino acid residues of cytochrome b at the Qo site affect both OH catalysis and ROS production. Whether or not all catalytically defective Qo site mutants always produce enhanced ROS, as a general property of the CIII enzyme, is unknown. 3.2 Bacterial cytochrome b Y302C mutation forms an inter subunit disulfide bond The bacterial mutant carrying the cytochrome b Y302C mutation was studied in detail. This mutant supported CHI-dependent anoxygenic photo synthetic growth of R. capsulatus. However, it progressively lost its CIII activity upon exposure to air due to slow oxidative disintegration of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in its Fe/S protein both in chromatophore membranes as well as in purified samples. On the other hand, although the homologous yeast cytochrome b Y279C mutant also produced ROS, its Fe/S protein [2Fe-2S] cluster did not exhibit oxidative damage. In the case of R. capsulatus, oxidative disintegration of the [2Fe-2S] cluster required not only the presence of O2, but also the catalytic activity of the Qo site and the presence of a free thiol group at position 302. Strict anaerobiosis, highly reducing conditions, as well as use of Qo site inhibitor stigmatellin or thiol-alkylating reagents (e. g., iodoacetamide or N-ethyl-maleimide) abolished the oxidative damage in the Y302C mutant. Using the bacterial mutant CIII, mass spectrometry analyses revealed for the first time that the mutant cytochrome b and the Fe/S protein subunits of CIII were covalently cross-linked to each other by an inter subunit disulfide bond formed between the thiol groups of cytochrome b Y302C and the Fe/S protein C155. It was therefore proposed that the ROS-induced cysteine redox chemistry reduced the intra molecular disulfide bridge, which is naturally present in the Fe/S protein and stabilizes its [2Fe-2S], to render this cluster oxygen labile and the mutant CIII air-sensitive (Fig. 2b). The striking difference seen in respect to the stability of their Fe/S protein [2Fe-2S] clusters between the bacterial Y302C and its yeast counterpart Y279C is intriguing. Comparison of R. capsulatus and S. cerevisiae cytochrome b amino acid sequences show that while the yeast protein has several cysteine residues, the bacterial counterpart has none. In the former species, one of these cysteine residues (C342, yeast numbering) is structurally located nearby the Y279 (Fig. 2b). Whether the presence of additional cysteine residues counteracts the effect of Y279C mutation (for example by promoting an intra molecular disulfide bond within cytochrome b) is unknown. Mass spectrometry analyses of purified native, Y279F and Y279C yeast CIII enzymes were conducted in our group. In the case of Y279C mutant, the data indicated that the trypsin-gluC fragment encompassing Y279 (W273YLLPFX279AILR283, where X279 is Y, F or C in native, Y279F and Y279C mutants, respectively) is only detectable after dithiothreitol (DTT) reduction and iodoacetamide alkylation (unpublished data). This finding suggests that in the yeast mutant the cysteine residue at position 279 might also be modified by a DTT-cleavable chemical group of unknown identity. Inspection of the bovine (Fig. 2b) (and also human) cytochrome b sequence indicates that, although it also contains several cysteine residues, none of them is structurally located in the vicinity of Y278 (homologue of R. capsulatus Y302). Whether the oxidative disintegration of the Fe/S protein [2Fe-2S] observed with the bacterial CIII also occurs in mammalian CIII remains to be seen. 3.3 Human mitochondrial cytochrome b Y278C mutation and ROS production Very recently, a human mitochondrial CIII produced by a homoplasmic cybrid line generated using fibroblasts of a patient bearing the m.l5579A>G (p.Y278C, i.e., the human homologue of R. capsulatus cytochrome b Y302C mutation) (Fig. 2c) heteroplasmic mutation became available. This mutation was identified in a patient with severe exercise intolerance and multisystem disorders, and provided a unique opportunity to extend the significance of the findings emanating from the bacterial case. Comparison of appropriate homoplasmic cybrids carrying either the wild type or the cytochrome b Y278C mutation showed increased intolerance to galactose (hallmark of defective oxidative phosphorylation), drastic loss of CIII activity (over ~ 90%) and highly decreased CHI-dependent oxidative phosphorylation in the mutant. However, the enzymatic activities of the individual CI and CIII complexes, as well as the coupled activities of the CI+III and CII+III supercomplexes were little affected in the mutant. Moreover, no complete loss of the ETC driven membrane potential, or ATP synthesis was observed, suggesting that CI and CII were able to sustain some ATP production despite the low CIII activity. Excitingly, as observed with the bacterial CIII, enhanced O2.− production was seen in mitochondria isolated from mutant cybrids, compared to wild type cells. Moreover, an imbalance in homeostasis of the major intracellular antioxidant homeostasis, i. e., an increase of the ratio of oxidized (GSSG) versus reduced (GSH) glutathione ratio was observed, in agreement with increased oxidative stress in mutant cybrids. Indeed, the CI, CIII and CI+III activities increased significantly when mitochondrial preparations were carried out in the presence of DTT. Due to material limitations, reliable detection of the Fe/S protein [2Fe-2S] cluster by EPR spectroscopy has not yet been achieved even with mitochondria from wild type human cybrids, leaving open the question of oxidative disintegration of the Fe/S protein [2Fe-2S] cluster via ROS production. Similar to the bacterial case, no subunit assembly defect of CIII was seen with the human cytochrome b Y278C mutation as compared to wild type cybrids, based on SDS-PAGE/immunoblots. Wild type and mutant mitochondria contained similar amounts of CIII as revealed by BN-PAGE of dodecylmaltoside dispersed mitoplasts. However, BN-PAGE analyses of digitonin dispersed mitochondrial respirasomes showed decreased amounts of CIII dimers and CIII+IV supercomplexes, but slightly compensatory increased levels of CI1III2IVn (n = number of monomers) supercomplexes. The overall data suggest that supra molecular interactions between the respiratory complexes are important for maintaining basal respiratory ETC function in the Y278C mutant. An emerging hypothesis from this ongoing work is that CIII activity might be better protected against oxidative damages when the mutant CIII is part of the CI1III2IVn supercomplexes (Fig. 3). Thus, comparative studies conducted for the first time with bacterial and human mitochondrial CIII bearing the same homologous mutation (Y302C and Y278C, respectively) would suggest a new protective role for supra molecular organization of respiratory complexes in membranes.",4083
27194483,"Introduction Cytochrome bc1 is one of the key enzymes of respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains. The enzyme couples electron transfer between ubiquinone/ubiquinol and cytochrome c with proton translocation1 across the membrane. Typically, the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c contributes to generation of protonmotive force used for adenosine triphosphate synthesis (for recent reviews, see). However, in some cases, the direction of electron flow through cytochrome bc1 can be reversed, leading to oxidation of cytochrome c and reduction of ubiquinone. The translocation of protons across the membrane involves two types of ubiquinone-binding sites facing opposite sides of the membrane: one site oxidizes ubiquinol, whereas the other reduces ubiquinone (figure 1). The joint action of these sites defines the basis of catalytic Q cycle. To secure energetic efficiency of this cycle, the ubiquinol oxidation site (the Qo site) directs electrons into two separate cofactor chains. One electron is used to reduce cytochrome c1 via electron transfer through the Rieske cluster (FeS) and haem c1 in one cofactor chain (the c-chain), whereas the other electron is transferred across the membrane to the Qi site via two haems b (haem bL and bH of the b-chain).  The idea that oxidation of ubiquinol in complex III directs electrons into two separate chains, one involving cytochrome b and the other cytochrome c, was introduced by Wikström & Berden in 1972. It emerged from a number of earlier observations documenting the intriguing effect of oxidant-induced haem b reduction in the presence of antimycin (inhibitor of the Qi site) (see and references therein). This idea was preceded by a tentative scheme published in 1967 by Baum et al., who also proposed two separate electron acceptors of ubiquinol, but in that work the connection between the two chains of cofactors was not yet understood. In 1975, Peter Mitchell adopted the idea of Wikström & Berden and introduced the cyclic arrangement of electron transfer through the protonmotive Q cycle featuring two quinone binding sites (as we now know Qo and Qi sites), each standing at a divide of two cofactor chains. In 1983, the Q cycle was modified by Crofts et al., who realized that electrons for ubiquinone reduction at the Qi site both come from the same cofactor chain, leaving Qo as the only site separating the route for two electrons upon catalysis. The reaction at the Qo site, often referred to as a bifurcation, is unusual in biology. Its mechanism is still a matter of intense debate. The lack of crystal structures containing native ubiquinone molecule bound in the Qo site and a long-standing difficulty in spectroscopic identification of the intermediate states of the Qo site catalysis have left a high degree of freedom for mechanistic considerations. Typically, because of the two-electron nature of ubiquinol oxidation or ubiquinone reduction, a semiquinone (SQ) species is expected to be formed as an intermediate of the reaction. Indeed, such intermediates were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in several quinone binding sites, including the Qi site of cytochrome bc1, the QB site of photosynthetic reaction centre, and quinone sites of mitochondrial complex I and II (reviewed in). All those sites are connected to a single chain of cofactors and, consequently, the two-electron oxidation/reduction of QH2/Q must proceed step-wise involving a relatively stable and manageable for experimental trapping SQ intermediate. However, the architecture of the Qo site creates distinctly different conditions for ubiquinol oxidation: the substrate binds in between the two chains of cofactors and thus can experience simultaneous presence of two redox centres (FeS cluster and haem bL) ready to engage in electron transfers. In this case, the two-electron reaction does not need to proceed through the relatively long-lived SQ intermediate. With this simultaneous access to the two electron paths, a detection of SQ intermediate has proven difficult. One of the early attempts of detection of a semiquinone radical within the Qo site (SQo) by equilibrium redox titration failed to detect a radical signal in CW EPR spectra of redox-poised bacterial chromatophores. In mitochondrial system, the first report of detection of SQo was questioned in later work which led to a commonly accepted view that detection of this species, if it exists, falls beyond the limits of EPR sensitivity. This has been considered as confirmatory of Mitchell's original idea that the stability constant of SQo (Ks) must be less than unity. However, recently three groups reported a detection of a SQ at the Qo site. Intriguingly, each of the described SQs seems to have different spectroscopic properties. Additionally, the conditions in which they were trapped and subsequently detected by EPR were different. Here, we summarize those reports focusing on comparison of SQ species with respect to their interactions with paramagnetic cofactors of cytochrome bc1 and interaction with nearby magnetic nuclei of protein surroundings (tables 1 and 2). We reflect on new mechanistic perspectives offered by these discoveries.   First report of antimycin-insensitive semiquinone signal on submitochondrial particles In 1981, de Vries et al. reported the detection of a new SQ in antimycin-inhibited submitochondrial particles under conditions of oxidant-induced reduction of haems b initiated by addition of fumarate/succinate to the membranes. This SQ signal was antimycin-insensitive but disappeared after addition of British anti-Lewisite—a thiol-containing compound that disrupts the Rieske cluster in cytochrome bc1 and abolishes activity of the Qo site. Spectral properties of this SQ were different from the antimycin-sensitive SQ signal originating from the Qi site (SQi). This new SQ had clearly slower spin-lattice relaxation rate than SQi and exhibited smaller linewidth; the reported values were 8.3 and 10 G for the new SQ and SQi, respectively. It should be noted that subsequent literature reported the linewidth of approximately 8.5 G for SQi signal. The possible sensitivity of the antimycin-insensitive SQ to specific inhibitors of the Qo site was not tested by the authors of the original report. However, the later work by Rich and co-workers showed that under similar experimental conditions this SQ signal was not sensitive to inhibitors that block the activity of the Qo site (myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene or stigmatellin), but at the same time, it was at least partially sensitive to several inhibitors of complex I and II. Light-induced transient semiquinone in photosynthetic membranes In 2007, Dutton and co-workers generated SQo in chromatophore membranes of photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter (R.) capsulatus, which consisted of a complete cyclic electron transfer system that can be activated by light. In this system, cytochrome bc1 is coupled to photosynthetic reaction centre via cytochrome c2 and ubiquinone pool (figure 2a). The authors predicted that SQo should be visible at high pH which lowers the redox-midpoint values of the quinone couples provided that multiple flashes are delivered to mostly oxidized c-chain. The key to promoting SQo was to use the haem bH knockout in which the b-chain can accept only one electron. Indeed, with the help of these predictions, they detected flash-induced SQ in this mutant which, based on its properties, was assigned as SQo. The radical signal at g = 2.004 was detected by EPR after freezing of the light-induced samples, and the amplitude of the signal was different depending on the time delay before freezing suggestive of its transient character. The signal was sensitive to stigmatellin, a potent inhibitor of the Qo site, but not to myxothiazol—another inhibitor of the Qo site. To explain the differential sensitivity to the two inhibitors, the authors assumed that in the case of myxothiazol, the inhibitor and ubiquinone bind simultaneously. In this mode, the residual activity of the Qo site (interaction of ubiquinone with Rieske cluster) can still generate SQo. The idea of a simultaneous presence of ubiquinone and myxothiazol within the Qo site is inspired from crystallographic data which show that inhibitors can bind to distinctly different domains of the Qo site: stigmatellin forms hydrogen bond with histidine ligand of FeS cluster while myxothiazol binds closer to haem bL. Furthermore, simultaneous binding of ubiquinol and β-methoxyacrylate inhibitors or binding of two molecules of ubiquinol was implicated from biochemical work and more recent NMR studies. However, recent data obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of cytochrome bc1 suggest that the Qo site is a rather compact cavity and binding of additional quinone-like molecule next to the ubiquinol is energetically unfavourable.  To ascertain that the stigmatellin-sensitive signal originated form the Qo site but not from other ubiquinone reactive protein, the authors tested conditions where oxidizing power of high potential c-chain was severely limited by slowing the electron transfer through haem c1 by orders of magnitude. As predicted, the light-induced SQ was not observed under those conditions, confirming that efficient outflow of electrons from Qo through the c-chain is necessary for SQo generation. The SQo spectrum, having an EPR linewidth of 11.7 G, appeared broader than the spectrum of SQ formed at the Qi site (8.5 G). To explain the greater width of SQo spectrum, the authors considered the possibility of magnetic interactions with reduced Rieske cluster. This should manifest itself in a difficulty to saturate the CW EPR signal of SQowhich, however, was not observed experimentally. Factors other than interaction with fast-relaxing paramagnetic centre that would explain the greater linewidth of the SQo signal include greater g-tensor anisotropy and/or hyperfine interactions with nearby magnetic nuclei that are not resolved in CW EPR spectra at X-band. Destabilized semiquinones in the Qo site detected in isolated cytochrome bc1 Two publications by Kramer and co-workers reported detection of SQ in the Qo site in isolated antimycin-inhibited bacterial and yeast cytochrome bc1 under anaerobic conditions. In 2007, SQ was observed in the samples of R. capsulatus cytochrome bc1 freeze-quenched 10 ms after mixing with ubiquinol analogue—decylubiquinol (DBH2). Because cytochrome c was absent (figure 2b), to initiate the reaction at the Qo site, a significant fraction of Rieske cluster and cytochrome c1 must have been in the oxidized state prior to mixing. This, however, is problematic given the relatively high redox midpoint potentials of these two cofactors and the fact that the experiments were carried out under anaerobic conditions. Native cytochrome bc1 in this species, without any external oxidant added, typically shows 70–80% reduction level of cytochrome c1 while significantly lower reduction levels may indicate some structural distortions or protein damage. While the EPR radical signal was generally sensitive to stigmatellin, approximately 30% of the signal (SQres) still remained in the presence of this inhibitor. SQres shared some of the characteristics of stigmatellin-sensitive signal which was assigned as SQo. Both SQo and SQres signals were broader than the signal of SQi and both showed similar power-saturation profiles. On the other hand, addition of exogenous relaxation enhancer (Ni2+ ions) suggested that the SQres was more exposed to the aqueous phase. For that reason, SQres was assigned to non-enzymatic oxidation of DBH2 in solution. However, as the experiment was performed in the absence of oxygen, this oxidation could not have been associated with O2. Rather, one can envisage that SQres formation might have been a result of a comproportionation. SQres exhibited different proton electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectrum from the SQ chemically induced in buffer (SQchem). At the same time, SQo signal was reported to have indistinguishable CW EPR spectrum from the chemically produced SQchem. Both SQo and SQres showed decreased amplitudes (greater than 10-fold) in the presence of molecular oxygen. The signals were not seen in the bc1 subcomplex (a complex of cytochromes b and c1 but lacking FeS subunit). Analysis of proton ENDOR spectra indicated that all three types of SQs (i.e. SQo, SQres and SQchem) were in the anionic form. This was inferred from the observation that hyperfine coupling constant of five-methyl group to the SQ electron spin in all three cases was different from the values characteristic for protonated/neutral SQs. A contribution of central line in SQo and SQres ENDOR spectra was different from that found in the spectrum of SQchem which was taken as indication that both SQo and SQres are located in the environment of lower proton concentration comparing with the aqueous phase of the SQchem environment. Electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectra showed no indications that SQs form hydrogen bonds with amide group of polypeptide chain nor histidine residues. Importantly, the properties of SQo, including power saturation behaviour, did not reveal signs of dipolar magnetic interactions between SQo and neighbouring paramagnetic cofactors of the Qo site, such as reduced FeS or oxidized haem bL. This, together with the confusing, in our view, properties of SQo versus SQres and problematic initial state of the enzyme raise concern about the origin of the signals. In 2013, Kramer and co-workers described SQo trapped using a method similar to that described previously, except that this time cytochrome c was added to provide oxidizing power to the c-chain and initiate the reactions in the Qo site (figure 2c). While the width of new EPR signal of SQo was similar to that reported previously, the relaxation properties were clearly different. The spin echo of SQo decayed (2p-ESEEM experiment) much faster in comparison with SQchem signal in buffer which indicated that this time, unlike the previous case, the SQo interacted with fast-relaxing paramagnetic species. The authors concluded that the paramagnetic species that affect SQo are haems nearest to SQo which, based on simulations, were proposed to be either two haems bL (each coming from individual monomers of cytochrome bc1 dimer) or haem bL and haem c1 (both coming from the same monomer; figure 2c). However, no spectroscopic data verifying the oxidation state of haems were provided, nor relaxation rates for haems used in simulations, which are crucial parameters in determining distances by the use of relaxation enhancement. The FeS cluster was excluded because of its slow relaxation when compared with haems at the temperature used in the experiments. While the new SQ signal was generally sensitive to stigmatellin, around 30% of the signal was still observed in CW EPR spectra in the presence of substoichiometric concentration of this inhibitor. The sensitivity to other Qo site inhibitors was not reported and it was not shown whether this new SQ signal disappears in the control mutants with inactive Qo site. The overall shape of SQo proton ENDOR spectrum was similar to those reported previously for SQo and SQres indicating that SQo was deprotonated. Nevertheless, the splitting of doublet signals flanking the distant protons peak in ENDOR spectra was clearly larger than previously reported implying that the detected SQs were in different environments. The analysis of 4p-ESEEM spectra combined with the lack of the signal of nitrogen in 2p-ESEEM indicated that SQo was not hydrogen-bonded to the protein. Comparison of bacterial and yeast cytochrome bc1 did not reveal any spectral differences which indicated that SQo in both cases is the same chemical species trapped in similar environment. The properties of SQo that emerged from ESEEM and ENDOR data led the authors to propose a model of ‘electrostatic cage’ trapping deprotonated SQo. In this model, SQ is destabilized by lack of specific binding through hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. Insulating dielectric cage blocks the proton uptake back to SQo which secures that it does not leave the site. At the same time, the cage is supposed to prevent escape of any superoxide anion (or SQ) formed in the site. However, the destabilized SQo is proposed to conserve sufficient redox energy to reduce haem bL which seems difficult to reconcile with the statement that SQo interacts paramagnetically with the oxidized haem bL. Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that in photosynthetic reaction centres a similar concept of low dielectric gate around the SQ binding site was introduced to rationalize high stability of SQ, because the contributions from electrostatic energy and hydrogen bonds were not enough to explain SQ stabilization. Semiquinone uncoupled and spin–spin coupled to Rieske cluster in isolated cytochrome bc1 In 2013, our group reported a discovery of two EPR transitions associated with the activity of the Qo site. Those transitions revealed the presence of two distinct populations of SQo formed at this site. The first signal at g = 1.94 was assigned as one of the transitions originating from the spin–spin exchange of two unpaired electron spins: one coming from SQo and the other from the reduced Rieske cluster (figure 3a). The second transition near g = 2.0 corresponded to the population of SQo for which the spin–spin exchange did not exist or was too weak to be resolved (figure 3b). Both populations were observed in samples of isolated, antimycin-inhibited cytochrome bc1 of R. capsulatus exposed to substrates, DBH2 and oxidized cytochrome c, under aerobic conditions. The changes in the amplitudes for these two signals (radical at g = 2.0 and SQo–FeS spin-coupled centre at g = 1.94) during the catalytic turnover can be divided into two time regions. In the first (earlier) region, the amplitudes increase until they reach maximum, whereas in the second (later) region, the amplitudes progressively decrease to zero at the time point when the system reaches equilibrium.  Both signals were sensitive to stigmatellin and several other Qo-site-specific inhibitors (including myxothiazol and various synthetic strobilurins). Both signals were not observed in specific mutants that disabled activity of the Qo site (such as cytb:G158 W) or the bc-subcomplex. Moreover, in the presence of these inhibitors or mutations, no residual radical signals were detected. On the other hand, in +2Ala mutant (a mutation that makes the FeS head domain stay at Qo site for prolonged time), the signal amplitude was higher compared with the native protein. More recent experiments indicate that both signals can also be generated under anaerobic conditions and that the characteristic g = 1.94 can be observed in native chromatophore membranes of R. capsulatus. We proposed that the two populations of SQo reflect two configurations of the Qo site. The spin–spin exchange (g = 1.94) by its nature has a clear distance constraint and can take place only when SQo and Rieske cluster are in proximity, as shown in figure 3a. In this configuration, a formation of a hydrogen bond between histidine residue coordinating Rieske cluster and ubiquinone molecule is possible. At larger distances (figure 3b) or upon breaking the putative hydrogen bond between SQo and histidine ligand, spin–spin exchange disappears and SQo becomes detected as a separate free radical species having a signal near g = 2.0. Nevertheless, in this case, SQo exhibited unusually fast relaxation compared with the relaxation of chemically generated SQ in buffer (by auto-oxidation of DBH2 in alkaline pH), which was expected given that the SQo is located in proximity to fast-relaxing paramagnetic metal centres of the Qo site: oxidized haem bL and/or reduced FeS. The fast spin-lattice relaxation of SQo manifested itself in significant homogeneous broadening of the EPR lines (both at X and Q band), the inability to saturate it with microwave power, and the presence of a Leigh effect (decrease in amplitude without apparent line broadening upon decrease of temperature). All these specific properties differentiated this SQo from the radical signals described in. The two populations of SQo were incorporated to the model of electronic bifurcation of the Qo site. We envisaged that the SQo–FeS (g = 1.94) form might represent an initial step of ubiquinol oxidation when oxidized FeS withdraws an electron from ubiquinol. This state evolves into the state where SQo and reduced FeS exist as separate identities (distinguished by separate spectra, one of which is radical g = 2.0) before reduction of haem bL by SQo takes place to complete the oxidation of QH2 at this site.",3227
33780775,"Introduction One of the key roles of mitochondria is to supply ATP, synthesized by the F1FO-ATP synthase. The F1FO-ATP synthase uses the proton electrochemical gradient generated by the proton pumping of the respiratory chain complexes (RCC), located in the cristae folding of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Given that these complexes are all located at the IMM, cristae morphology was proposed to influence mitochondrial respiration and energy conversion efficiency. Genetic and apoptotic manipulations proved indeed that cristae morphology favors assembly of RCCs into quaternary respiratory supercomplexes (RCS). The existence of respiratory supercomplexes (RCS) is becoming unambiguously accepted, reinforced by the resolution of their structure by cryo-electron microscopy that provides a basis for their functional role. Notwithstanding, controversies on supercomplexes function still exist. This may be due to technical issues along with coexistence of RCS different conformations. Controversies particularly concern RCS engagement in electron transfer, stability of complexes, substrate channeling, ROS generation, protein nucleation, and pathological consequences. Recent cryo-EM structural data and functional experiments of assembly factors manipulation suggest that RCS facilitate cytochrome c shuttle between CIII and CIV and hence maximal respiration. Structural data also suggest that transfer of electrons can be facilitated the in the “respirasome” RCS (Letts et al., 2016). Both cristae shape and RCS stability depend on the formation of cristae junctions (CJ), narrow tubular structures connecting the cristae to the inner boundary membrane. CJ fulfill a variety of biological functions: they needed to individualize cristae as independent, dynamic bioenergetic units; CJ are also central to keep the bulk of cytochrome c inside the cristae and pro-apoptotic BH3-only BCL-2 family members such as BID, BIM-S or BNIP3 induce cytochrome c mobilization to the IMS by causing CJ enlargement and inversion of the cristae curvature. From a bioenergetics point of view, the aberrant ultrastructure caused by apoptotic signals destabilizes RCS composition. Conversely, cristae preservation favors RCS stability and mitochondrial-dependent cell growth. The IMM dynamin-related protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is central for the processes described above: its oligomers maintain CJ tight to prevent cytochrome c mobilization and therefore control the mitochondrial arm of apoptosis. By narrowing cristae independently of its mitochondrial pro-fusion role, OPA1 also stabilizes RCS and regulates respiratory efficiency. OPA1 favors also the supramolecular assembly of the F1Fo-ATP (ATP) synthase into oligomers. This configuration sustains mitochondrial ATP levels and homeostasis during starvation, limited respiratory substrate availability or compromised electron transfer. In this latter condition, improved bioenergetics and electron transfer by RCS may prevent both reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and their effects. However, the role of mitochondrial ultrastructure in controlling ROS levels remains unclear. We therefore dissected whether and how OPA1 can influence mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Stabilization of cristae by OPA1 preserves ATP synthase dimerization and reversal activity, required to sustain the electrochemical gradient, and reduces mitochondrial ROS levels. We illustrate how Opa1 limits ROS accumulation via ATP synthase dimerization and activity. Results OPA1 overexpression prevents mitochondrial ROS accumulation The master regulator of cristae shape Opa1 protects from compromised mitochondrial function and respiratory chain blockage by sustaining F1FO-ATP synthase (ATP synthase) reversal activity. It is however unclear whether Opa1 also impacts ROS accumulation, a known product of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and a player in cell death caused by respiratory dysfunction. To address this question, we first confirmed that viability of Opa1Tg mouse adult fibroblasts (MAFs) where Opa1 is mildly upregulated (Fig. S1a), was sustained when they were cultured in medium supplemented with galactose to halt glycolysis and force ATP biosynthesis by mitochondria (Fig. 1a). Reciprocally, deletion of Opa1 in MAFs from Opa1flx/flx mice (Fig. S1b) doubled cell death in galactose-containing media (Fig. 1b). We then profiled mitochondrial function in cell lines cultured in glucose vs. galactose. We did not measure any difference in the basal levels of the potentiometric dye tetra methyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) in glucose or galactose containing media, between Wt and Opa1Tg cells (Fig. S2a). In glucose-containing media, TMRM response to the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, a reliable assay to unveil latent mitochondrial dysfunction was also similar between Wt and Opa1Tg cells (Fig. S3a). We obtained similar results when we analyzed the chemical component of the proton electrochemical gradient (ΔμH+) using mtSypHer, a genetically encoded pH ratiometric sensor targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. In galactose-containing medium, basal mtSypHer ratios were slightly lower, irrespective of the genetic background of the cells or even the absence of Opa1 (Fig. 1c, d, S3b). This Opa1-independent matrix acidification likely reflects the activation of mitochondrial ATP synthase when glycolysis is marginal and mitochondrial OXPHOS is engaged to produce ATP. We therefore compared resting matrix ATP levels measured using the genetically encoded sensor ATeam1.03. Interestingly, we did not see differences in mitochondrial ATP levels between WT and Opa1Tg MAFs, irrespective of the monosaccharide supplemented to the culture media. ATP levels were lower in mitochondria of both genotypes when cells were cultured in galactose-containing medium (Fig. 1e and f). Altogether, these experiments indicate that in glucose- or galactose-containing media, the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient and steady state mitochondrial ATP levels are similar in WT and Opa1tg MAFs. Nevertheless, when cells rely on mitochondrial respiration to provide ATP, Opa1 overexpression preserves cell viability, independently from changes in ΔμH+ or mitochondrial ATP levels. We therefore evaluated ROS levels in mitochondria in the two cell types using mt-roGFP1, a genetically encoded ROS sensor targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, responsive to 1 mM H2O2 (Fig. S4). In glucose containing media steady state mt-roGFP1 fluorescence ratio was slightly but not significantly lower in Opa1tg vs. WT MAFs. When cells were switched to galactose media, mt-roGFP1 fluorescence ratio significantly increased in WT but not in Opa1tg cells (Fig. 1g). These data indicate that when mitochondrial respiration is stimulated, ROS accumulation is lowered by Opa1 overexpression. We next addressed if Opa1 overexpression could also prevent ROS production when mitochondrial respiratory activity was inhibited. To this end, we treated cells with antimycin A (AA) which stimulates ROS production by interfering with the Q cycle in complex III. Two independent sensors of mitochondrial ROS production, the fluorescent dye MitoSOX and the ratiometric probe mt-roGFP1 concurrently reported that mitochondrial ROS accumulate in WT but not Opa1tg MAFs treated with AA (Fig. 2a and b). In Opa1tg cells, TMRM decayed in response to the concomitant inhibition of complex III using AA and ATP synthase using oligomycin slower than in WT cells (t1/2: 20 min in WT cells, 24 min in Opa1tg, Fig. S3c). Accordingly, Opa1tg MAFs grown in galactose were protected from cell death induced by AA (Fig. 2c), as we previously reported. Altogether, these data indicate that Opa1 overexpression protects from ROS accumulation produced by forced respiration and complex III inhibition. OPA1 requires ATP synthase activity to reduce mitochondrial ROS accumulation We wished to understand how Opa1 overexpression reduced ROS accumulation. We therefore first measured levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. Immunoblotting showed no difference in the levels of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), glutathione synthetase (GSS) or glutathione reductase (GSR) as well as of the master transcriptional regulator of the antioxidant response NRF2 in Opa1tg vs. WT MAFs, irrespective of whether they were grown in galactose or glucose containing media (Fig. 3a). These results suggested that the reduced ROS accumulation in Opa1tg MAFs was not due to an increase in the antioxidant enzymatic defenses. We next asked whether expression of catalase, an antioxidant enzyme genetically modified to be targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (mtCAT) could enhance the protection afforded by Opa1 overexpression. Moderate mtCAT expression (Fig. 3b) reduced superoxide accumulation in both WT and Opa1tg MAFs grown in galactose (Fig. 3c), without altering basal mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. S1b). Judging from experiments of real time mitochondrial membrane potential measurements, mtCAT expression did not protect from acute AA-induced mitochondrial depolarization in cells of either genotype, indicating that mtCAT does not directly interfere with loss of membrane potential upon acute AA exposure in our setting (Fig. 3d). However, mtCAT prevented the spontaneous cell death observed in WT MAFs grown in galactose, whereas it did not increase the protection afforded by Opa1 overexpression (Fig. 3e), indicating that this mitochondrially targeted catalase protects WT cells from ROS accumulation and cell death but is not additive to Opa1 overexpression. Altogether, these experiments point to the existence of a mechanism different than induction of antioxidant defense that explains the resistance of Opa1tg cells to ROS. We therefore wondered whether the reduced ROS accumulation observed in Opa1tg MAFs involved the known stimulatory effect of Opa1 on the activity of the ATP synthase. Indeed, the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin abolished the protective effect of Opa1 overexpression on AA-induced ROS accumulation (Fig. 3f). OPA1 stabilizes ATP synthase monomers and oligomers under restricted glycolysis Because our results pointed to a role for ATP synthase in the reduced ROS accumulation observed in Opa1 overexpressing cells, we wished to characterize the relationship between Opa1 and ATP synthase in ROS accumulation. We first compared ATP synthase oligomerization in cells cultured in glucose and in galactose, a condition where ROS accumulate. We measured in blue-native gel electrophoresis (BNGE) gels the assembly ATP synthase in mitochondria from WT MEFs cultured in glucose and galactose containing media. In-gel activity (as well as levels) of ATP synthase oligomeric forms were lower in galactose than in glucose-based media (Fig. 4a and b). However, we noticed that in galactose ATP synthase monomers were more efficiently assembled, as we could not detect any free F1 subunit that was conversely visible in BNGE from cells cultured in glucose (Fig. 4c and d). Importantly, oligomycin inhibited in gel activity of monomeric ATP synthase, but not of free F1, indicating that OSCP does not copurify with F1 and that under our experimental conditions this band represents non assembled F1 (Fig. S5). These results indicate that in galactose containing media ATP synthase monomer assembly is favored, whereas superassembly is impaired. This decrease in ATP synthase oligomers observed in galactose was accompanied by the destabilization of Opa1 oligomers (Fig. 4e and f). We therefore tested whether Opa1 overexpression prevented the destabilization of ATP synthase oligomers in galactose, and the accumulation of free F1 in glucose-rich media. In Opa1Tg cells cultured in both glucose and galactose oligomeric OPA1 was increased, as expected (Fig. 4e and f). In glucose, levels of oligomeric ATP synthase were slightly but not significantly increased, but we could not detect any free F1. Oligomers of ATP synthase were significantly more stable in Opa1Tg than in WT cells cultured in galactose (Fig. 4b, d). Genetic Opa1 deletion yielded the opposite results of Opa1 overexpression: ATP synthase oligomeric levels and activity were reduced (Fig. S6a-d). Free F1 levels were greatly reduced also in Opa1 knockout cells when cultured in galactose containing media (Fig. S6d). Taken together, these results indicate that OPA1 abolishes the reduction in ATP synthase dimers observed in cells cultured in galactose. Opa1 requires ATP synthase dimerization to prevent ROS accumulation Because Opa1 protects from mitochondrial dysfunction by sustaining cristae shape and ATP synthase supramolecular assembly, we wished to address the role of cristae shape and ATP synthase oligomerization in the observed reduced ROS accumulation. We therefore deleted the supernumerary ATP synthase subunit e (ATP5k) that is critical to form dimers at cristae tips. Importantly, ATP5k deletion and subsequent impairment of dimerization does not significantly impact resting ATP, mitochondrial content and mtDNA, although it may compromise OXPHOS and ATPase activity that is favored when ATP synthase is in its oligomeric forms. We first addressed whether cristae shape changed depending on the monosaccharide supplied to the cells. Switching cells from glucose to galactose resulted in a reduction in the total number of cristae per mitochondrion (Fig. S6a-c) but more importantly in a reduction in cristae width (Fig. S6a,b,d). These data suggest that cristae dynamics is modulated by the fuel utilized for mitochondrial respiration and confirm that Opa1 overexpression reduces cristae width, irrespective of the fuel burned. We next silenced ATP5k in cells grown in glucose. Cristae were altered morphologically and reduced in number in WT but not in Opa1Tg cells (Fig. 5a and b). Silencing of subunit e on the other hand blunted the protective effect of Opa1 on accumulation of mitochondrial ROS induced by AA (Fig. 5c). Similarly, it abolished the ability of Opa1 to prevent spontaneous cell death of MAFs grown in galactose containing medium (Fig. 5d). In conclusion, Opa1 requires F1FO-ATP synthase dimerization to block ROS production and cell death caused by mitochondrial bioenergetic stress.",2050
34389670,"Hemes are common redox-active cofactors in biological electron transfer systems. Their major function is to transfer electrons within the cofactor chains or as part of the catalytic sites. The direction and rate of electron transfer are secured by the specific properties of hemes, among which the redox midpoint potential and the spin state are considered to be of crucial importance. Several studies have been carried out to understand how specific molecular elements contribute in adjusting the redox potential values to the levels required for efficient electron transfer rate. These studies recognized the importance of the heme-iron ligands, the degree of exposure of the heme to the solvent, and specific interactions, including hydrogen bonding, within the amino acids of heme-binding pocket. However, the overall structural complexity of proteins often makes an experimental extraction of individual elements of control extremely challenging, in particular those associated within the hydrogen bonding networks. It is indeed remarkable that the fluctuation of the hydrogen bond network was identified as the factor modulating the efficiency of long-range biological electron transfer. This work focused on exploring the hydrogen bond-related elements of control of the redox properties of one of the hemes of cytochrome b subunit of cytochrome bc1 (mitochondrial complex III). Cytochrome b is the only subunit of this complex encoded by mitochondrial DNA, thus is a subject of high susceptibility for spontaneous mutations in comparison to other subunits (encoded by nuclear DNA). Such mutations often lead to systemic disorders, mitochondrial diseases, manifesting in symptoms such as exercise intolerance, myopathies, or neuropathies. On the other hand, their mimic in the bacterial or yeast model systems not only provides insights into the possible molecular basis of the disease but also reveal molecular aspects of protein design. With this in mind, we targeted a mutation G34S (human cytochrome b numbering), found in one 52-y-old female patient suffering from exercise intolerance. The mutation was present in mitochondria from muscle tissue and caused mild myopathy, lactic acidosis, and defect in mitochondrial complex III activity. The mutated glycine 34 is located on transmembrane helix A of cytochrome b subunit in close distance (∼8 Å) to heme bH (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B). This location suggests the possible effect of mutation on the properties of heme cofactor, in particular if one considers that a change of small and nonpolar glycine to a larger and polar serine may affect the local hydrogen bonding environment. Indeed, the presence of glycine at position 34 was previously noticed as important for heme packing in the cytochrome b subunit. Interestingly, the importance of G34 was emphasized by the remarkable evolutionary conservation in the equivalents of cytochrome bc1 complex in distant organisms, such as bacteria, insects, fish, mammals and even plants. In a bacterial model (Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochrome bc1), the equivalent G48 residue was mutated to valine and aspartic acid, both rendering the bacteria photosynthetically incompetent. The equivalent of this mutation was also studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast with G33S (S. cerevisiae numbering) mutation were not able to grow aerobically, whereas the isolated bc1 complex had lower enzymatic activity and disrupted subunit composition (lower level of the iron-sulfur protein assessed by Western blotting and lower cytochrome b content, measured optically to 55% of wild type [WT]). The same G33 position was found to be mutated to aspartic acid in a respiratory-deficient yeast. Among the 85 tested G33D revertants, 82 were D33G and 3 were D33A, suggesting that only a small amino acid without a charge can be tolerated at this position. Given the implicated importance of glycine at 34 position of mitochondrial cytochrome b, particularly in the context of hydrogen bonding network within the heme-binding pocket, we combined the experimental and computational methods to investigate the effects of introducing serine to the homologous position in purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus (mutant G48S). Notably, the bacterial cytochrome b shares reasonable sequence similarity with human and yeast mitochondrial cytochrome b, close to 57%. We found that G48S perturbs the redox properties of heme bH and causes structural and hydration changes in the vicinity of heme. The mutation also severely affects the spectral properties of heme bH, which are best explained by a model assuming a reversible change from low to high spin state when the heme is oxidized. The latter comes as a rather unusual and unexpected molecular effect, considering all so-far reported effects of disease-related mitochondrial mutations. At the same time, it offers interesting insights into the role of hydrogen bonding and protein packing in maintaining the low spin state of the oxidized heme fostering electron-transfer relay function. Results The Spectroscopic Properties of G48S Mutant. The unusual electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of hemes b in G48S mutant. As a first step of investigation of the molecular effects of mitochondrial mutation equivalent in R. capsulatus, the basic characterization of the mutant was performed. Bacteria with G48S mutation on cytochrome b in comparison to WT exhibited only slightly slower growth under cytochrome bc1-dependent photosynthetic conditions, suggesting that mutated complex is functional (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). However, several attempts of G48S purification resulted in varying stoichiometry of the complex subunits indicating its low stability in solution. Therefore, all of the further analyses were carried out using membrane chromatophores. The optical absorption spectra of hemes and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of [2Fe-2S] cluster did not reveal significant changes in G48S chromatophores in comparison to WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Also, the light-activated kinetics (measured under conditions with quinone [Q] pool half-reduced) did not reveal any major difference in rates of heme bH reduction from quinol oxidation at Qo site, with only heme bH reoxidaton impaired in G48S in comparison to WT (Table 1). However, the unusual behavior of hemes in G48S was revealed by continuous wave (CW) EPR spectroscopy at low temperature. Under typical conditions, the WT sample fully oxidized with ferricyanide exhibits the g = 3.41 transition, corresponding to oxidized low spin heme bH. This signal is also present in the ascorbate-reduced sample (Fig. 1A, black), indicating that the heme remains oxidized, which is consistent with the well-described low redox midpoint potential (Em7) of this heme (∼50 mV). In G48S mutant, this EPR transition was not present neither in a sample fully oxidized (see top black spectrum in Fig. 2B, Right) nor reduced with ascorbate (Fig. 1B, black). At the same time, the transition corresponding to oxidized heme bL was observed in G48S with the same value g = 3.78 as for WT sample (Fig. 1). In previous studies, the lack of g = 3.41 was observed when the bis-His ligation pattern of heme bH was changed by mutation. Thus, the lack of g = 3.41 in G48S immediately suggests that this mutation also might introduce structural changes affecting the heme-ligand interactions. Interestingly, addition of antimycin (the Qi site-specific inhibitor) to the ascorbate-reduced sample resulted in the appearance of resonance transition g = 3.40 reflecting the oxidized heme bH (Fig. 1B, red). This phenomenon was not observed for the fully oxidized sample inhibited with antimycin (Fig. 1C, red); to observe the g = 3.40 transition, the G48S sample must have been reduced with ascorbate prior to the addition of antimycin (Fig. 1C, green). It is of note that the g value (g = 3.40) of G48S corresponded to the g value of heme bH in WT in the absence of antimycin (in WT, addition of antimycin results in the shift of its EPR g transition from 3.41 to 3.45). These results indicate that in G48S mutant, the redox properties of heme bH are significantly changed in comparison to WT. The most straightforward explanation for the lack of g = 3.41 EPR transition in the G48S sample is an increase in the Em of heme bH, which would have to be large enough to render this heme fully reduced in the presence of ascorbate (i.e., the Em of the heme bH would have to be in the range of 200 mV or more). This prompted us to look more closely into the redox properties of this heme. Influence of G48S mutation on the redox properties of heme bH observed by optical spectroscopy. The redox equilibrium between hemes b and the Q pool was monitored by light-induced electron transfer under the conditions favoring electron transfer from quinol occupying Qi site to oxidized heme bH. This reaction can be observed with the Qo site-specific inhibitor (in this work, myxothiazol) when the reducing power of the Q pool is increased (by increasing pH) and the Q pool is oxidized before the light activation. The rate of heme bH reduction under these conditions for G48S mutant is approximately 10-fold lower than WT (Table 1), whereas the amplitude is two times higher (Fig. 1 D and E, blue) approaching the level of heme bH reduction in the absence of inhibitors (Fig. 1 D and E, black). The observed increase in the amplitude of heme bH reduction in G48S could be a result of either an increase in the Em of the heme or a modified interaction of the heme with the redox-active occupant of the Qi site, which would lead to an “apparent” increase of Em of the heme. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the optical redox potentiometric titrations of the G48S mutant in the absence and presence of antimycin were analyzed in reference to WT. At pH 7, hemes b in WT without inhibitors titrate with Em values of +128 mV, +60 mV, and −124 mV, corresponding to heme bHH (a fraction of heme bH with higher Em), heme bHL (a fraction of heme bH with lower Em), and heme bL, respectively (Fig. 1F, black). The presence of two forms of heme bH (bHH and bHL) is well established and interpreted as an indication of interaction of the heme with the redox-active occupant of the Qi site. When this interaction is prevented in the presence of antimycin, heme bH titrates as one component with Em7 of +60 mV (Fig. 1F, red). G48S without inhibitors titrates with the three components having Em values of +148 mV, +21 mV, and −136 mV (Fig. 1G, black), which correspond to hemes bHH, bHL, and bL of WT, respectively. The main difference is a considerably larger fraction of the high-potential heme bHH (Em +148 mV), which in G48S accounts for about 50% of total b-type hemes, whereas it only accounts for 30% in WT. In the presence of antimycin, heme bH in G48S titrates as one component with Em of +73 mV (Fig. 1G, red), which closely resemble titrations of this heme in WT. The larger amplitude of heme bHH in G48S in the absence of inhibitors and the lack of significant changes in Em of this heme in the presence of antimycin indicate that the apparent increase in Em of heme bH in G48S is in part related to modified interaction of this heme with surroundings and also in part with the redox-active occupant of the Qi site. Intriguingly, the magnitude of this increase is not large enough to explain the lack of g = 3.40 transition in the ascorbate-reduced sample in the absence of antimycin (Fig. 1B, black). To solve this discrepancy, we performed EPR redox titrations of hemes b in G48S and WT. These titrations monitor disappearance/appearance of oxidized low spin hemes and thus complement the optical titrations, which monitor disappearance/appearance of the reduced hemes. We thus expected that combining both types of titrations would help us understand the properties of heme bH in G48S. Indication of heme bH spin state conversion by G48S mutation from EPR measurements. The EPR redox titrations were carried out in a wide range of magnetic induction to observe changes of all possible resonance transitions upon changing the redox state of the sample. The reductive titration of fully oxidized sample did not reveal any signal of low spin paramagnetic centers (highly axial low spin [HALS] type) that could be assigned as heme bH (Fig. 2, step 1). Moreover, addition of antimycin at ambient redox potential (Eh) ∼40 mV (which is below the Em value of heme bH in WT) did not change the EPR spectra of hemes (Fig. 2, step 2). However, the subsequent oxidative titration with ferricyanide (i.e., after addition of antimycin) resulted in the appearance of resonance transition g = 3.40, the amplitude of which increased with the increase of Eh reaching a maximum at around 200 mV (Fig. 2, step 3). The Em of this transition was calculated to be +62 mV at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2C, Right), which is remarkably similar to the Em of heme bH described for WT. Given this similarity and the position of g, this transition was assigned as the low spin heme bH. Interestingly, along with the changes seen in g = 3.40 transition, the unusual and absent in WT changes of resonance transition g = 5.99 were also observed. During the reductive titration, the amplitude of this transition decreased significantly (Fig. 2B, green dashed line) and did not rise to the initial value during the oxidative titration (Fig. 2C, Left). Considering that g = 5.99 transition is characteristic for high spin oxidized hemes, it suggests that in contrast to WT in mutant, there is a fraction of high spin hemes. During the reductive titration of G48S, the low spin heme bH signal is not observed but appears during the oxidative titration phase. It is thus clear that the g = 3.40 transition appears at the expense of g = 5.99. To explain all these observations, we conclude that the oxidized heme bH in the G48S is high spin (no g = 3.40 transition) and upon reduction undergoes conversion to low spin (no g = 3.40 transition but optical maximum at 560 nm). The interactions of G48S at atomic level. All experimental results indicated some prominent changes of spectroscopic and redox properties caused by G48S mutation. However, their molecular bases were difficult to explain. Thus, we engaged computational methods to study the possible structural changes and interactions of mutated residue with local protein environment, especially with heme bH. To investigate the effects of mutation at an atomic level, classical atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on models built from crystal structures of R. capsulatus and S. cerevisiae cytochrome bc1 (Protein Data Bank [PDB] IDs 1ZRT and 3CX5, respectively). Additionally, in order to shed light on the redox behavior of heme bH, density functional theory (DFT) calculations on WT and mutant cluster models were performed. Structural rearrangement and altered hydrogen bonding caused by G48S. The results of MD simulations reveal a clear local difference between the WT and G48S mutant. In bacterial WT complex simulations, the backbone of Gly48 (-NH) makes an H-bond with the propionate group of heme bH with 28% ± 4% occupancy of all simulated trajectories (Fig. 3A). However, in mutant, structural rearrangement takes place, causing H-bond formation between heme bH propionate and Ser48 sidechain (-OH) instead of the protein backbone. This relatively stable H-bond occurs rapidly (<1 ns) with an occupancy of 53% ± 6% over all G48S simulation trajectories (Fig. 3B). The same scenario is observed in MD simulations of mitochondrial cytochrome bc1, where even more drastic difference occurs in H-bond occupancies of WT and mutant. While the serine sidechain-based H-bond to propionate is highly stable for 79% ± 1% of total simulation time, the glycine backbone forms a weaker H-bond with ca. 13% ± 2% occupancy (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and B). Interestingly, presence of a bulkier serine instead of glycine also causes structural perturbation, which is observed as slight bending of the transmembrane A helix (Fig. 3C). In addition, two different conformational arrangements are observed in simulations of mutant bacterial cytochrome bc1. In one case, Ser48 resides next to the His111 ligand of heme bH (“near” arrangement, ca. 6 Å distance between Ser Cα and Fe atoms), whereas in another case it shifts further away (“far” arrangement, ∼8.5 Å distance between Ser Cα and Fe atoms), with the H-bond to propionate still retained (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the more tightly packed “near” arrangement is found to be highly stable in WT Gly case (Fig. 3D). This tight packing partly restricts the conformational freedom of the His111 ligand (SI Appendix, Fig. S4C). We also find that due to the larger structural variability of polar side chain of serine as in “far” arrangement, more space is created, which also results in a higher level of hydration near the heme propionate group in mutant in comparison to WT enzyme (Fig. 3 E and F). Clearly, mutation of Gly to Ser changes the dynamics and polarity of the region, which may explain the spectroscopic differences observed between WT and mutant. The results from DFT calculations on bacterial model systems show that when Ser sidechain is H-bonding to the propionate group, as opposed to Gly backbone, it enhances the electron affinity of heme bH by ∼0.13 eV. This effect is observed in all three different DFT functionals used (0.11 ± 0.05 eV in B3LYP, 0.15 ± 0.06 eV in TPSS, and 0.14 ± 0.07 in TPSSh). The increase in electron affinity is also seen based on DFT calculations performed on high-resolution structure of mitochondrial bc1 complex, albeit the effect is relatively milder (30 meV to 40 meV across the three density functionals utilized). Overall, the data clearly indicate that even the subtle change in hydrogen bonding environment affects the heme bH redox properties. The influence of antimycin on H-bonding arrangement in G48S mutant. In order to study the effects of antimycin on H-bond dynamics, we also performed MD simulations on an antimycin-bound structure of bacterial complex. Due to relatively weaker stability of antimycin in our MD simulations, we restrained it to its crystallographic position by harmonic restraints (see Table 2). We found that Ser still makes H-bond to propionate (∼20% ± 5% of total simulation time). However, stable H-bonds to the carbonyl group of antimycin are observed (∼30% ± 9% occupancy) as long as it binds to the Qi site in a stable crystallographic arrangement (Fig. 3H). Interestingly, the H-bond to antimycin from Ser occurs on an exclusive basis such that H-bond to propionate ceases to exist. In WT case, a weak H-bond to propionate was formed for ∼15% ± 5% of the simulation time; however, the Gly backbone was unable to form the hydrogen bond with antimycin. Overall, the antimycin-bound WT state resembles the H-bonding situation in the quinone-bound WT state, but mutant explores an alternative H-bonding scenario with antimycin. In addition, the “near/far” dynamics of antimycin-bound cytochrome bc1 are found to be similar to quinone-bound simulations (both WT and mutant; Fig. 3D).",3094
23144696,"Introduction A C150T transition in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was found to occur more frequently in centenarians and in twins of an Italian population. The C150T base substitution, which is located in the mtDNA D-loop region and causes a remodeling of the mtDNA 151 replication origin in leukocytes, was found to be homoplasmic in about half of the leukocyte samples in which the base substitution was observed. Because of this homoplasmy and because the C150T transition is a commonly occurring polymorphism, it is likely in these cases that the base substitution is an inherited polymorphism rather than a somatically acquired mutation. In fact, the C150T polymorphism is associated with several haplogroups or subhaplogroups, including J2, D5, M7b, T2, U3, U5, and N9a. Furthermore, observations of associations between haplogroup and longevity have been reported. For instance, DeBenedictis and colleagues found a higher frequency of the J haplogroup in healthy older men from northern Italy. Similarly, Niemi and colleagues found that the haplogroup frequencies in a sampling of very old individuals (vitality 90+) in Finland differed from those in the middle-aged controls, haplogroups U, K (U-K) and J being more prevalent among the old individuals. The subhaplogroups of U were unspecified in that study. More recently, in Finnish and Japanese subjects, 150T and two additional common polymorphisms, 10398G and 489C, all of three of which occur in the J2, D5, and M7b haplogroups, were associated with longevity. The C150T transition was not associated with longevity in the U5, T2, and N9a haplogroups. Relevant to the work we present here, the J2 haplogroup, with T at position 150, was found at a higher frequency, and the J1 haplogroup, with C at position 150, at a lower frequency, in very old individuals than in a control population. Besides the non-coding region C150T polymorphism, longevity has also been found to be associated with mtDNA coding region polymorphisms such as 5178A, which defines haplogroup D, occurring in Asian individuals, and 9055A, which defines haplogroup K  . However, conflicting associations with regard to the 5178A polymorphism have been reported. The aforementioned associations are based on population genetics. The consequences on mitochondrial function of these longevity-associated polymorphisms, if any, are unknown. At present there have been few studies that identify functional effects of DNA polymorphisms. In order to understand the effect of the C150T transition or of its associated haplogroup polymorphisms, we have analyzed cybrids obtained by fusing cytoplasts derived from human fibroblasts carrying or not the C150T transition with human mtDNA-less cells (ρ0 cells) derived from an osteosarcoma cell line. In particular, we found, among the fibroblast strains used in the previous study by Zhang and colleagues, two pairs that were matched in haplogroup but differed at position 150 (Table 1). The first pair was of the U haplogroup. One fibroblast strain was of the U3a subhaplogroup and carried the C150T transition. The other fibroblasts were of the U-K2 subhaplogroup and had C at position 150. The other pair of fibroblasts strains was of the J haplogroup. The members of this pair were of the J2b (C150T) and J1c (150C) subhaplogroups. Heretofore we will refer to subhaplogroups as haplogroups. These fibroblast strains served as mtDNA donors in the construction of cybrids. The use of cybrids made with the ρ0 cell line allows us to observe the effects of mitochondrial polymorphisms without the confounding effects of the varying nuclear backgrounds. We have searched for phenotype differences between cybrids of different haplogroups. We have analyzed growth rate, respiratory rate, mitochondrial protein synthesis rate, mtDNA level, steady state level of components of the respiratory chain and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production rate. We have found that the one parameter that correlates with the presence of the C150T transition is a lower ROS production rate. ROS have long been thought to play a role in aging. Thus, longevity that is associated with particular haplogroups may be at least partly explained by the relative level of ROS production that is allowed or specified by those haplogroups. Results Generation of cybrid cell lines with different mtDNA haplogroups and growth properties Fibroblast strains that were used by Zhang et al.  were subjected to haplogroup analysis. Strains AG07309 (LS 11) and AG13152 (LS 4) were identified as belonging to Haplogroups U and U-K, respectively, and strains AG07135 (LS9) and AG14421 (LS 10) were identified as belonging to Haplogroup J. Subsequent DNA sequence analysis of the cybrids refined the haplogroup identities to U3a, U-K2, J2b, and J1c, respectively (Table 1). These four fibroblast strains were enucleated and subsequently fused to mtDNA-less human ρ0 cells (see Materials and methods). The cybrid clones derived from each fibroblast strain are listed in Table 1. We chose three or more transmitochondrial cybrid clones from each fusion for analysis. The presence or absence of the C150T transition in each clone was verified by allele-specific termination of primer extension. Later, DNA sequencing of the mtDNA of several of the clones confirmed the base at position 150. Haplotype-matched C150T transition and “wild type” 150C clones were then used for the biochemical characterization described below.  Figure 1 shows that the cybrid cell lines of the two haplogroups U3a and U-K2 have a nearly identical doubling time, or growth rate. Also, whereas the overall mean doubling time of J1c is greater than that of J2b, the difference is not statistically significant. Mitochondrial protein synthesis and COXII protein level difference in two haplogroup pairs  Figure 2A  shows electrophoretic patterns of the mitochondrial translation products of the cybrids. Patterns of the mtDNA-encoded polypeptides of the 150T-carrying cybrids were qualitatively identical, in terms of electrophoretic mobility of the various polypeptides, to those of the 150C-carrying cybrid cells. Figure 2B  shows a quantification of the results of the labeling experiments. The mean rate of labeling of the mitochondrial translation products in U3a (C150T) cybrids was higher than the mean value measured in the U-K2 (150C) cybrid cell lines. In contrast, the labeling rate in J2b (C150T) cybrids was lower than that in the J1c (150C) cybrid cell lines. However, because of the variability among the cybrid clones, the difference between the U3a and the U-K2 cybrids was not significant; nor was the difference between the J2b and the J1c cybrids. In addition, Western blots revealed that the variations in the steady state levels of complex IV subunit II (COXII) among the individual cybrids reflected, for the most part, corresponding variations in the overall rate of labeling of mitochondrial translation products (data not shown). Respiration differences between two haplogroup pairs The respiration rate of intact cells utilizing endogenous substrates was measured by polarography. As shown in Figure 3A , the U3a (C150T) cybrids exhibited higher rates of total O2 consumption, by 85%, relative to the U-K2 (150C) cybrids. In contrast, the J2b (C150T) cybrids showed a lower level of overall respiratory capacity, by 45%, as compared to the mean value of that of the J1c (150C) cybrids. The effect of the uncoupler dinitrophenol (DNP) on endogenous respiration, as revealed by the ratios of uncoupled to native respiration, was similar in U3a and U-K2 cybrids and similar in J2b and J1c cybrids (Figure 3B ). Thus, the differences in endogenous respiration rates are not due to differences in the level of proton leakage of the inner membrane. In order to investigate differences in individual enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, O2 consumption measurements were carried out on digitonin-permeabilized cells, using different substrates and inhibitors. As illustrated in Figure 4A , in the U3a (C150T) cybrids, the rate of malate/glutamate-driven respiration, which reflects the activity of complex I, was significantly higher, by 89%, than the average rate in the U-K2 (150C) cybrid cells. Similarly, the rate of succinate/glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P)-driven respiration, which reflects the activity of complex III, was significantly higher in U3a cybrids, by 110%, than the average rate in the U-K2 cybrids (Fig. 4B ). Furthermore, the rate of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD)/ascorbate-driven respiration, which reflects the maximum activity of Complex IV, was higher by 31% in U3a cybrids (Fig. 4C ). J haplogroup cybrids showed the opposite trend; i.e., the J2b (C150T) cybrids showed generally lower rates than the J1c (150C) cybrids, i.e lower by ∼30% for malate/glutamate-stimulated respiration; by ∼30% for succinate/G3P-stimulated respiration; and by ∼20% for TMPD/ascorbate-stimulated respiration (Fig. 4). The relative rates of malate/glutamate-driven respiration among the different haplogroups paralleled the rates of respiration observed in intact cells, as expected. Membrane potential differences in two haplogroup pairs Maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) is necessary for production of energy (ATP), for protein import, and therefore, for the maintenance of most mitochondrial functions and the preservation of cellular homeostasis. Figure 5 shows the results of flow cytometric analysis in cybrid cells loaded with the ΔΨm indicator tetramethylrhodamine ethylester perchlorate (TMRE). The membrane potential is similar in U3a (C150T) cybrid cell lines and U-K2 (150C) cybrid cell lines. There was variability in the membrane potentials among the individual J2b (C150T) cybrid cell lines and J1c (150C) cybrid cell lines, with F8 and TFA15 cybrid cell lines showing a large deviation from the other cell lines within their respective haplogroups. The reason for this is not clear. The differences in membrane potential between haplogroups are not statistically significant. Common ROS generation tendency between two haplogroup pairs The analysis of ROS production showed that the mean ROS production rate of the U3a (C150T) cybrid cell lines was 26% lower than that of the U-K2 (150C) cybrid cell lines (P = 0.0356) (and lower than those of the J2b and J1c cybrid cell lines (by 17%, P = 0.0142, and by 36%, P<0.0001, respectively)) (Figure 6). Similarly, the mean ROS production rate of the J2b (C150T) cybrid cell lines was 23% lower than that of J1c (150C) cybrid cell lines (P<0.0001). Because ROS production rate differences may arise from differences in ROS generation rate or differences in natural ROS defenses, we investigated whether the expression of ROS defense enzymes also differ. The MnSOD protein level, as revealed by Western blotting, did not differ between the U3a and the U-K2 cybrids, nor did it differ between the J2b and the J1c cybrids (data not shown). Mitochondrial DNA sequencing We sequenced the entire mtDNA of TF3A5 (U3a), E8 (U-K2), T8 (U-K2), F8 (J2b) and TFA7 (J1c) cybrid cell lines. Overlapping fragments covering the entire 16.5-kb mtDNA were amplified from genomic DNA. We compared our sequences to the revised version of the Cambridge Reference Sequence. All the variants identified, except those that differ from the H2b- and individual-specific polymorphisms present in the Cambridge Reference Sequence, are reported in Tables 2, 3, and 4. The mitochondrial genome sequences of the haplogroup cybrid cell lines differed by 33–35 nucleotide substitutions from the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence. Some of the individual-specific polymorphisms are novel (Table 4). Only the TF3A5 cybrid cell line harbors heteroplasmic nucleotide changes, specifically in complex I subunits. The sequence of the U3a haplogroup cybrid revealed that almost all the coding region polymorphisms are U3a haplogroup specific; i.e., there are few individual specific polymorphisms aside from those that specify the U3a haplogroup.",1836
30550726,"Introduction The ubihydroquinone (QH2): cytochrome (cyt) c oxidoreductase (cyt bc1) of the purple bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus has three catalytic subunits: the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP) with its Fe2S2 cluster, cyt b, and cyt c1 that represent a “catalytic core” common to all cyt bc1 enzymes from diverse species. The cyt bc1 exploits the energetically favorable transfer of electrons from reduced quinone (QH2) to oxidized cyt c to generate a transmembrane proton gradient, subsequently used for ATP biosynthesis. This membrane-integral enzyme operates following the modified Q-cycle mechanism. Accordingly, the oxidation and reduction of QH2 and oxidized quinone (Q) molecules take place at two catalytic sites, Qo(p) and Qi(n), located on each side of the energy-transducing membrane. Following the oxidation of a QH2 molecule at the Qo site, two electrons are transferred to two different redox chains of cyt bc1. The first electron is conveyed to a high potential redox chain, in which the ISP Fe2S2 cluster and the heme of cyt c1 are reduced while two protons are released. The second electron from the QH2 oxidation is received by a low potential chain, in which the cyt b hemes bL and bH are reduced sequentially. From the heme bH of cyt b, this electron is conveyed to a Q molecule bound to the Qi site, generating a semiquinone (SQ). A second turnover of cyt bc1 fully completes the reduction of this SQ to a QH2, which is then released from the Qi site. With these successive reactions, the efficiency of cyt bc1 in terms of proton translocation per oxidized QH2 molecule increases twofold. The above described Q-cycle mechanism postulates a sequential bifurcated electron transfer at the Qo site, implying the formation of a SQ radical at Qo. A so-called concerted (versus sequential) reaction mechanism, in which QH2 at the Qo site undergoes two simultaneous electron donations to the Fe2S2 cluster and heme bL, has also been proposed (e.g.,). This possibility is disfavored by the detection of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals attributed to SQ at the Qo site, and in particular, by the observation of an EPR signal attributed to a spin-spin exchange of two unpaired electrons, one coming from SQ and the other from the reduced Fe2S2 cluster. Related discussions could be found in. In photosynthetic bacteria, the Q-cycle is common to both anoxygenic photosynthetic (Ps) and oxidative respiratory (Res) electron transfer pathways. During the Ps growth, the QH2 molecules arise from the activity of the photosynthetic reaction center (RC), which in turn receives electrons from the high potential redox chain of cyt bc1 via soluble or membrane-attached electron carriers (like the cyt c2 or cyt cy). The cyclic electron transfer between the RC and cyt bc1, energized by the photochemical activity of RC, generates a proton gradient via the release to the periplasm of protons derived from QH2 oxidation at the Qo site and the uptake from the cytoplasm of protons coupled to Q reduction at the Qi site of cyt bc1 and at the RC. The electron and proton transfer reactions occurring at the Qo site are tightly controlled in order to avoid the reactivity of the SQ intermediate formed during QH2 oxidation. These SQ species represent a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) whose amounts could be enhanced by decreased electron accepting abilities of the high potential redox chain of cyt bc1. Earlier studies have investigated the function of several cyt b residues located in the vicinity of the Qo site in respect to QH2 oxidation and catalytic turnover of cyt bc1. Experimental evidence supports the important roles of cyt b residues Glu295, Lys94 and His291 on the proton release pathway(s) to the periplasm. In addition, structural analyses indicated that Lys329 is among a set of cyt b residues that contributes to the docking surface for the extrinsic domain of ISP (ISP-ED). The cyt b ~ ISP-ED interaction surface is critical for correct positioning of the Fe2S2 cluster when the ISP-ED adopts the so called “b-position”, required for efficient electron transfer from the QH2 bound at the Qo site to the oxidized Fe2S2 of ISP. Upon reduction of the Fe2S2 cluster, a rapid movement (complete in < 100 μs) of the ISP-ED from the b-position to “c1-position” occurs, allowing fast electron donation to the oxidized heme of cyt c1. Studies showed that absence of the mobility of the ISP-ED, or perturbation of the surface loops at this region of cyt b via mutations or binding of Qo site inhibitors, abolished efficient QH2 oxidation. Specific mutations on the cyt b ~ ISP-ED interface tend to displace the ISP-ED from its native position at the Qo site. Indeed, the substitution with Gly or Ala of the highly conserved Lys329 of cyt b inhibited the cyt bc1 activity. However, the basis of this inhibition, and in particular its role in the electron and proton transfer reactions during QH2 oxidation has not been investigated in detail. Theoretical considerations (i.e., Density Functional Theory (DFT)-Continuum Electrostatic calculations), and experimental redox potential versus pH (pKa) measurements suggested that electrostatic interactions of the Fe2S2 cluster with its surrounding environment are important. Early on, we wondered how the electrostatic effects of a close-lying charged residue from the cyt b subunit would shift the pKa’s, and therefore the proton distributions, of the His ligands on the Fe2S2 cluster, particularly in the oxidized state. These external effects would add onto the electrostatic and dielectric effects internal (intrinsic) to the ISP-ED domain. The intrinsic effects, particularly their variations with sequence and structure, have been demonstrated by comparing the redox potential versus pH profiles of isolated ISP-ED’s from different organisms, and by comparative DFT/dielectric based calculations and analyses. In the present work, we characterized the properties of R. capsulatus mutants where cyt b Lys329, located nearby the ISP-ED Fe2S2 cluster, was replaced by Arg, Asp and Ala residues. We found that while Lys329Arg had no significant effect on Qo site catalysis, the Lys329Ala and Lys329Asp substitutions impaired both the Ps growth ability and the cyt bc1 activity of these mutants. Time-resolved, light-activated spectroscopy showed that electron transfer along the low and high redox potential chains, as well as proton release from the Qo site were inhibited, especially in the case of Lys329Asp mutation. Moreover, in silico docking studies suggested that the presence of an Asp residue at position 329 of cyt b changed the equilibrium position of the ISP-ED, by increasing the Fe2S2 ~ Qo site distance and perturbing the local H-bonding networks. Consequently, the transfer of the electrons and their coupled protons to the oxidized Fe2S2 cluster and its coordinating His residues of the ISP during QH2 oxidation were impaired without affecting the mobility of the ISP-ED towards cyt c1. Based on the overall experimental and computational data, theoretical considerations, and location of cyt b Lys329, we propose that a positive charge at this position nearby to the Fe2S2 cluster is critical for efficient transfer of the first electron and its coupled proton from QH2 to oxidized Fe2S2 cluster of the ISP to initiate Qo site catalysis of cyt bc1. Results Rationale for choosing cyt b Lys329 residue to probe its role in Qo site catalysis Earlier theoretical considerations and experimental data indicated that a positively charged residue near the Fe2S2 cluster of the ISP, which is an anion under physiological redox and protonation states (the overall cluster charge is zero only when the oxidized state is at acidic pH, where pH is significantly less than the pKa’s on the His ligands) might be important to drive the proton coupled electron transfer to initiate QH2 oxidation at the Qo site. The conserved charged surface residues of cyt b that are located near the Fe2S2 cluster when the ISP-ED is docked to the Qo site were examined for their ability to interact electrostatically with the oxidized Fe2S2. This analysis led to the highly conserved cyt b Lys329, which could play an important role with Qo site catalysis when mutated. We therefore targeted this residue using site-directed mutagenesis, and substituted it with a positively charged (Arg), a neutral (Ala), and a negatively charged (Asp) amino acid residue, and examined their properties. Effect of the cyt b Lys329 mutations on R. capsulatus Ps growth The purple non sulfur bacterium R. capsulatus requires an active cyt bc1 for Ps growth, but its Res growth is cyt bc1-independent, as it can also be carried out via its alternate quinol oxidase. The Ps growth abilities of mutants carrying the cyt b Lys329Arg, Ala and Asp substitutions were compared with a “wild type” R. capsulatus strain carrying a native cyt bc1 (encoded by petABC operon) on the plasmid pMTS1 harbored by a mutant lacking cyt bc1 (pMTS1/MT-RBC1). On enriched medium (i.e., unbuffered MPYE, pH initially adjusted to 7.0), all strains were able to grow by Res, but only the wild type and Lys329Arg and not the Lys329Ala and Lys329Asp strains grew by Ps. This phenotype indicated that the cyt bc1 of the latter two mutants were defective, but their Ps growth improved when a pH-buffered minimal medium (e.g., MedA, buffered with 100 mM phosphate pH, 7.0) was used instead of enriched medium (Fig. 1). The cyt bc1 contents of cyt b Lys329 mutants In order to assess semi-quantitatively the effects of the Lys329Arg, Ala and Asp mutations on the assembly and amount of cyt bc1 in various mutants, SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, optical redox difference (Fig. 2), and EPR (Fig. 3) spectroscopy were used. The strains containing pMTS1 and its mutant derivatives overproduced cyt bc1, rendering visible similar amounts of the ISP, cyt b and cyt c1 subunits in membranes separated by Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analyses using antibodies against cyt b showed that all mutants contained similar amounts of this subunit (Fig. 2B), and dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized optical spectra indicated that the b-type (560 nm peak) and c-type (550 nm peak) heme contents of membranes of all mutants (except MT-RBC1 lacking cyt bc1) were comparable (Fig. 2C). In addition, EPR spectroscopy of appropriate samples showed that the gy transitions corresponding to the reduced Fe2S2 cluster of the ISP were comparable in all strains (Fig. 3). Thus, mutating Lys329 of cyt b had no drastic effect on the in vivo amount or subunit and cofactor assembly of cyt bc1. We note that the gx = 1.80 transitions of the reduced Fe2S2 cluster of the ISP were modified in the Lys329Ala and Lys329Asp mutants as compared with the wild type and the Lys329Arg mutant, indicating perturbations between the Fe2S2 cluster and the quinone residing at the Qo site. Similarly, the responses of the latter mutants to the cyt bc1 inhibitor famoxadone were different thant the wild type and the Lys329Arg mutant, as indicated by their gx = 1.78 transitions (Fig. 3). Steady-state cyt bc1 activities of cyt b Lys329 mutants Next, the steady-state cyt bc1 activities of Lys329 mutants were measured using DBH2:cyt c reduction assays (Materials and Methods). Membranes of R. capsulatus wild type strain (pMTSI/MT-RBC1) exhibited an activity of 1.19 μmoles of cyt c reduced/min/mg of total membrane proteins (referred to as 100%). This activity was decreased to 13.5 % upon addition of 10 μM of antimycin, which is a specific Qi site inhibitor, confirming that a large fraction of the measured activity indeed corresponded to cyt bc1. As expected, membranes from a strain lacking cyt bc1 (MT-RBC1) showed ~ 2% of wild type activity as cyt bc1-independent background. On the other hand, the Lys329Arg, Lys329Ala and Lys329Asp mutants had lower antimycin-sensitive cyt bc1 activities, corresponding to ~ 85%, 33% and 11% of that of a wild type (pMTS1/MT-RBC1) strain, respectively, in line with their Ps growth abilities (Table 4). Thus, the Lys329Ala and Lys329Asp substitutions rendered the cyt bc1 significantly defective, and required analysis of their electron and proton transfer activities. We note that in all cases the antimycin-insensitive residual activities should not be equated with superoxide-mediated cyt c reduction as this latter activity was not determined. Effects of the cyt b Lys329 mutations on flash-induced carotenoid band shift kinetics Using dark-adapted chromatophore vesicles, the time dependence of the membrane potential (Δψ) can be monitored using the carotenoids electrochromic signal (CS) upon induction of the RC charge separation by a short actinic flash of light (Fig. 4). The first two phases of the CS kinetics, completed in a few μsec, separation inside the RC and the oxidation of the electron carrier cyts c by the photo-oxidized RC. A third, slower phase of CS (phase III), completed in the ms time scale, reflects the electrogenic events that occur within the cyt bc1. Originally, the phase III of CS has been attributed to the electrogenicity of the movement along the low potential chain of electrons originating from QH2 oxidation at the Qo and subsequent Q reduction at the Qi sites. In the presence of antimycin, electron transfer from heme bH to Q residing at Qi site is blocked, allowing further resolution of the phase III into antimycin-sensitive, and antimycin-insensitive but myxothiazol-sensitive phases attributed to heme bH oxidation and reduction, respectively. Addition of the Qo site inhibitor myxothiazol prevents oxidation of QH2 and reduction of heme bL. A subsequent alternative interpretation proposed that phase III of CS might reflect predominantly the electrogenic uptake/release of protons linked to the oxidation of heme bH and to the reduction of cyt c1. In any event, myxothiazol completely eliminates phase III to leave only the portion of CS corresponding to the electrogenic events due to RC photo-oxidation. The latter amplitude observed in the presence of myxothiazol could be used to normalize the CS signals between samples, as it is directly proportional to the charges transferred across the photo-oxidized RC. Such normalized CS signals for various mutants are shown in Fig. 4. In wild type membranes, a slower phase III corresponding to cyt bc1 activity was clearly seen (black trace). In the mutants, the amplitude and initial rate of this phase III decreased progressively from Lys329Arg (red trace) to Lys329Ala (green trace) mutations. The Lys329Asp (dark blue trace) mutation abolished almost completely the phase III of CS (Fig. 4, note the break in the time axis), establishing that the cyt bc1 associated electrogenic events were perturbed in the mutants. The effect of Lys329 substitutions on the kinetics of the cyt bc1 electrogenic events are better appreciated using the differential signals obtained by subtracting the CS signals obtained after addition of antimycin (i.e., antimycin-sensitive phase III) from those recorded using the uninhibited chromatophores (Fig. 5). For each mutant, traces have been normalized to the maximal absorbance change reached, and the data showed that the rate change of the antimycin-sensitive phase III was negligible in the case of Lys329Arg (red trace). In contrast, this rate change was clearly visible with Lys329Ala (green trace), and became well pronounced with Lys329Asp (dark blue trace) mutations. Effects of the cyt b Lys329 mutations on flash-induced cyt c re-reduction kinetics Reduction of cyt c and cyt b hemes and effects of specific inhibitors on light-induced turnover kinetics allows dissection of the electron transfer steps internal to cyt bc1. In dark adapted chromatophores redox poised at an Eh of ~ 110 mV, the high potential redox chain cofactors Fe2S2 and heme c1 are reduced, whereas the low potential redox chain cofactors hemes bL and bH are oxidized. Upon excitation by a flash of light, the photo-oxidized primary electron donor of the RC is quickly reduced via the electron carrier cyts c (c2 and cy in R. capsulatus) that in turn rapidly transfer the oxidizing equivalents to cyt c1 to activate the cyt bc1 turnover. The oxidized cyt c1 is re-reduced by the Fe2S2 cluster of the ISP-ED, which receives an electron from the oxidation of QH2 molecule at the Qo site, yielding a transient SQ. The transfer of electrons from the Qo site to cyt c1 via the Fe2S2 center requires a large-scale movement of the ISP-ED, which is essential for cyt bc1 catalysis. In wild type chromatophores, the flash-induced cyt c re-reduction kinetics under uninhibited conditions (Fig. 6, black trace in panel WT) reflected the sequence of the redox events described above. A fast, unresolved oxidation of cyts c was followed by a re-reduction phase in the ms time scale via electrons shuttled by the ISP-ED from the Qo site. Under our conditions, addition of antimycin barely affected (green trace), whereas that of myxothiazol (blue trace) clearly inhibited, these cyt c re-reduction kinetics by impeding the Qo site catalysis. In addition, the flash-induced extent of total cyts c oxidation increased by adding stigmatellin (red trace), which trapped the ISP-ED at cyt b surface to block its large-scale movement required to bring the reduced Fe2S2 cluster near cyt c1 heme for fast electron transfer. In the presence of stigmatellin, the electron residing in the ISP-ED (at the Eh of ~ 100 mV used here) is blocked, revealing complete extent of oxidized cyts c. The data indicated that all Lys329 mutants were sensitive to myxothiazol (blue traces) and to stigmatellin (red traces) (Fig. 6), but in the absence of any inhibitor the re-reduction of the flash-oxidized cyts c was weakly and strongly slowed down in the Lys329Ala and Lys329Asp mutants, respectively (Fig. 6, panel KA and KD, black traces). In particular, the slow electron delivery to oxidized cyt c1 in the Lys329Asp mutation was well visualized when the cyt c kinetics obtained in the absence of inhibitor were overlapped (Fig. 7A). In the mutants, the cyt c re-reduction rates were not due to impaired movement of the ISP-ED as the amplitude of cyt c oxidation seen in the presence of myxothiazol increased clearly upon addition of stigmatellin. This finding was further supported quantitatively in Fig. 7B, by subtracting the cyt c kinetics traces recorded after addition of stigmatellin (Fig. 6, red traces) from those obtained in the presence of antimycin plus myxothiazol (Fig. 6, blue traces), establishing that in all Lys329 mutants the large-scale movement of the ISP-ED was unperturbed. Thus, the slowing down of the electron residing on the pre-reduced Fe2S2 center to cyt c1 reflected slow Qo site catalysis. Effects of the cyt b Lys329 mutations on flash-induced cyt b reduction kinetics Delivery of the second electron originating from QH2 oxidation at the Qo site to the low potential cyt b chain can be monitored by following the reduction of heme bH in the presence of antimycin, which impedes electron transfer from heme bH to Q molecule at the Qi site. Thus, flashinduced cyt b reduction kinetics in wild type and mutant stains were examined (Fig. 8). At an Eh of ~ 115 mV, the reduction rate of heme bH approaches its maximum, due to the large amount of QH2 present in the Q pool that can react at the Qo site, and the pre-oxidation of the low potential chain hemes b. The data showed that cyt bH reduction rate was strongly impaired in the Lys329Asp substitutions, in line with the cyt bc1 associated phase III of CS (Figs. 4 and 5) and cyt c re-reduction kinetics (Figs 6 and 7A). Since the delivery of the first electron from QH2 oxidized at the Qo site to the high-potential chain of cyt bc1 is a prerequisite for reduction of the low potential chain by the second electron, the observed effects on cyt bH reduction kinetics confirmed the perturbed cyt c re-reduction kinetics seen in the mutants. Thus, the presence of a negatively charged residue at the position 329 of cyt b was inhibitory to the reduction of cyt bH. Flash-induced proton release in the cyt b Lys329 mutants R. capsulatus cells broken up using a French press yield chromatophore membranes that are inverted vesicles (Materials and Methods). Flash activation of cyt bc1 catalysis induces transient acidification of the internal lumen of these vesicles due to proton release coupled to QH2 oxidation at the Qo site. The decrease of pH, reflecting this proton release, can be monitored by following the flash-induced absorption changes at 546 nm of the amphiphilic pH indicator dye NR. Measurements were performed on chromatophores incubated with 13 μM NR, 1 mM Na-ascorbate and the redox mediator 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (3,6 diaminodurene or DAD) in order to obtain an Eh comparable to that employed when examining electron transfer kinetics. Absorption changes that reflect only the proton release kinetics from the Qo site were obtained by subtracting the kinetics obtained in the presence of antimycin A and myxothiazol from those recorded in the absence of inhibitor, and the absorbance increase seen at 546 nm reflected the NR detected lumen acidification for chromatophores from the wild type and Lys329 mutants (Fig. 9). The half times of proton release kinetics were essentially coincident in the wild type and in the Lys329Arg mutant, while slightly slower and strongly retarded kinetics were seen with the Lys329Ala and Lys329Asp mutants, respectively. Thus, the kinetics of proton release coupled to QH2 oxidation at the Qo site were affected especially by the Asp substitution, again in line with the cyt c and cyt b electron transfer kinetics and CS associated with mutant cyt bc1. We concluded that the loss of the positive charge at position 329 of cyt b to a neutral one inhibited partially, whereas its substitution with a negative charge abolished drastically the Qo site catalysis of cyt bc1. Docking studies The structural effects induced by the cyt b Lys329Asp mutation were further examined in silico using molecular recognition (docking) calculations (Materials and Methods). Since the available R. capsulatus cyt bc1 (PDB code: 1ZRT) structure was not suitable for these calculations due to its low (3.5 Å) resolution and other structural parameters (RFree = 0.358, 21% of Ramachandran outliers, 22% of side-chain outliers), the higher resolution structure of R. sphaeroides with its better structural parameters (PDB code: 2QJY, resolution: 2.4 Å, RFree = 0.251, 1% of Ramachandran outliers, 4% of side-chain outliers) was chosen. This choice was acceptable as the R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides cyt bc1 share very high homology (84%, 61%, and 75% sequence identity for cyt b, cyt c1, and ISP subunit, respectively). For the docking calculations, first a benchmark calculation was run to obtain in silico a wild type cyt b ~ ISP-ED complex from R. sphaeroides. Then, a second docking calculation was performed in which the structure of cyt b Lys329Asp was modeled in silico using the same modelling procedure. In both cases the transmembrane portion of ISP and cyt c1 were excluded to simplify the calculations, which was justified as the ISP-ED large-scale movement was unaffected by the cyt b Lys329Asp mutation (Figs 6 and 7). Both docking calculations were run by adopting a knowledge-based docking approach, and guiding molecular recognition through the use of the most conserved residues of the ISP-ED and cyt b (Table 3), located on their interaction surface in the proximity of the Qo site and the Fe2S2 cluster. The 200 structures resulting from the first benchmark docking were clustered based on the RMSD of the protein backbone, yielding one cluster containing 181 and the other 7 structures (the remaining 12 structures were not assigned to any cluster). A representative structure from the most populated cluster is depicted in Fig. 10A and B. The general molecular geometry of the wild type cyt b ~ ISP-ED complex is in agreement with that found in the crystal structure. Superimposition of the Cα atoms of cyt b from the calculated best structure with those of the crystal structure, yielded a Cα RMSD for ISP-ED of 2.08 Å. This deviation decreased to 0.94 Å when only the residues located in the vicinity of the Fe2S2 cluster (128–137 and 148–155, R. sphaeroides numbering) were considered. The data showed that this region of cyt bc1 involved in the electron transfer was modeled with good accuracy. Both in the crystal structure and in the wild type model complex, the cyt b Lys329 side chain NH2 group formed an H-bond with the backbone oxygen of ISP-ED His131 (corresponding to His135 in R. capsulatus numbering), which is one of the two His ligands of the Fe2S2 cluster. The good agreement seen between the model obtained by the benchmark calculation and the available crystal structure allowed us to run a second round of docking calculations to assess the effects induced by the cyt b Lys329Asp mutation. As with the benchmark calculations, the 200 binding structures that resulted from the second docking calculations were clustered, and yielded four clusters populated by 165, 16, 7, and 4 model structures of the mutated cyt b ~ ISP-ED complex. A smaller number (2 vs 4) of clusters, and a larger number (181 vs 165) of structures in the most populated clusters were obtained with the wild type versus the mutated complexes, suggesting that formation of the mutated protein complex was slightly less favored than the wild type complex. In the mutated complex case also, the most representative structure from the most populated cluster is depicted in Fig. 10A and C. As in the previous case, the overall molecular geometry of the mutant cyt b ~ ISP-ED complex was in excellent agreement with the wild type complex found in the crystal structure. In this case, the Cα RMSD for ISP-ED was 1.86 Å, which decreased to 1.28 Å when only the residues in the vicinity of the Fe2S2 cluster were considered. The data suggested that the overall model of the mutant complex was more similar to the wild type crystal structure than the similarly modeled wild type complex (1.86 Å versus 2.08 Å, respectively). However, the region involved in electron transfer was modeled with a higher accuracy in the case of the wild type complex (0.94 versus 1.28 Å), which was confirmed by the RMSD of the Fe2S2 cluster (0.76 and 1.08 Å for the wild-type and the mutant complexes, respectively). Indeed, the distance between the stigmatellin and the center of the Fe2S2 cluster in the wild type complex was shortened by ~ 0.20 Å, whereas it was lengthened by 0.71 Å in the case of the mutant complex. The comparisons of the distances between stigmatellin and the Fe2S2 liganding residues (i.e., ISP-ED His131, Cys149 and His152, corresponding to His135, Cys153 and His156 in R. capsulatus numbering) also showed a similar trend. Furthermore, in the mutant complex, the cyt b Asp329 residue was found at a H-bonding distance from the side chain of ISP-ED His131 (Fig. 10C), indicating that the formation of this bond could shift away the position of the Fe2S2 cluster, and consequently that of His152 (His135 and His156 in R. capsulatus) at the Qo site. Taken altogether, the docking data suggested that when cyt b Lys329 is substituted with Asp, the ISP-ED ~ cyt b complex could still form. However, the small differences seen in the fine tuning of this macromolecular recognition process (i.e. the rearrangement of the H-bond between residue 329 and ISP-ED His131, which in the wild type and in the cyt b Lys329Asp mutant involved respectively the carbonyl O and the imidazole N atom of the His) could displace the Fe2S2 cluster away from its optimal position in the wild type complex, decreasing the electron transfer efficiency at the Qo site during QH2 catalysis.",4511
19667227,"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy(MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by gastrointestinal dysmotility, ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, cachexia, peripheral neuropathy, and leukoencephalopathy. It is caused by mutations in TYMP, a gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase. Deficiency in thymidine phosphorylase leads to marked elevation of thymidine and deoxyuridine levels, resulting in imbalance of the mitochondrial nucleotide pool. It has been hypothesized that alteration of deoxynucleotide triphosphate homeostasis results in improper mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication that in turn causes mtDNA deletion, point mutations, and depletion. Although TYMP is the only gene known to be associated with typical MNGIE, a few cases of MNGIE-like phenotype associated with multiple mtDNA deletions or mutations in POLG have been reported. Although mtDNA depletion is one of the characteristic molecular findings in MNGIE, mtDNA depletion is also associated with mutations in nuclear genes that affect mitochondrial nucleotide metabolism and mtDNA replication. These genes exert their action by either directly affecting the mtDNA replication fork (POLG, POLG2, and PEO1) or regulating the mitochondrial deoxynucleotide triphosphate pool (TYMP, TK2, DGUOK, SUCLA2, SUCLG1, and ANT1). Mutations in RRM2B (GenBank AB036532) were recently implicated in a novel mitochondrial depletion syndrome presenting with early-onset seizures, hypotonia, diarrhea, renal tubulopathy, lactic acidosis, and early lethality. Here we describe a 42-year-old woman with clinical findings strongly suggestive for MNGIE but whose plasma thymidine level was normal. Further analysis showed severe mtDNA depletion in muscle tissue, and sequencing analysis revealed 2 pathogenic mutations in the RRM2B gene. RESULTS DNA ANALYSIS Results of mtDNA analysis in peripheral blood and muscle were negative for deleterious point mutations by sequencing and deletions by array comparative genomic hybridization. A homoplasmic unclassified missense variant, m.15077G>A (E111K, CytB), was detected and previously reported in the Polysite database (http://www.genpat.uu.se/mtDB/) with a frequency of 2702:2 (A:G). A homoplasmic variant, m.16017T>C, in transfer RNA located at the first base of the stem region of the amino acid acceptor arm was detected. The clinical consequences of these nucleotide changes are unknown but likely represent benign variants. Sequencing of POLG, ANT1, PEO1, SUCLG1, and SUCLA2 did not identify deleterious changes. Sequencing of RRM2B revealed c.329G>A (p.R110H) and c.362G>A (p.R121H) mutations. Analysis of parental DNA confirmed that the identified mutations were in trans configuration. mtDNA DEPLETION The mtDNA content in blood and muscle was measured in duplicates and confirmed by repeat runs. Analysis of the mtDNA content performed on the muscle biopsy specimen showed 12% of the control mean content, but no depletion was detected in peripheral blood. PREDICTED STRUCTURAL CHANGES ON RIR2B To evaluate the effect of the mutations R110H and R121H, we examined the evolutionary history of each mutant in its local structural environment composed of the residues within 0.50 nm. The analyzed homologs consisted of 256 sequences coming from 165 different sources (including animals, plants, bacteria, and viruses). The metazoa sequences clustered in the phylogenetic tree and consisted of 60 sequences from 32 different species. Substitution R121H occurs in only 2.3% of homologs, which share less than 30% of the total sequence identity and only 8% of the sequence identity among the contacts in position 121. Substitution R110H is seen in 1.2% of homologs sharing less than 70% of the total and 46% of the local sequence identities. Both positions are almost invariant in RIR2B in metazoa. No homologs simultaneously carried histidine in both positions. Residues R110 and R121 are located in close proximity to each other and to the known homodimer RIR2B docking interface (Figure 3). Together these data are consistent with R121H and R110H being jointly sufficiently deleterious to affect the protein function. CLINICAL OUTCOME The patient received vitamin C (500 mg 3 times a day), vitamin E (400 units twice a day), coenzyme Q10 (200 mg twice a day), and levocarnitine (1 g 3 times a day). Within 6 months from starting the treatment, she showed normalization of the plasma lactate level and improvement in weight, muscle strength, eye movements, and daily life activities. Her hearing and deep tendon reflexes did not improve.",658
30582748,"Introduction The major energy-generating metabolic pathway in most mammalian cells is oxidative phosphorylation, where molecular oxygen is reduced to water by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. As a byproduct, mitochondria are also able to catalyze the one-electron reduction of oxygen to produce the superoxide radical (O2.-), a precursor of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is the most common reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell. Therefore, ROS formation is an inherent property of aerobic mitochondrial metabolism catalyzed by the respiratory chain complexes and matrix enzymes. The processes leading to the generation of ROS have gained significant attention over the last 30 years due to their involvement in apoptosis, hypoxic cellular responses, aging, and various signaling pathways (reviewed in). Mitochondria are commonly considered a major source of ROS, but the conditions under which mitochondrial ROS are produced is still a matter of debate. Excessive levels of ROS lead to oxidative stress, which plays a crucial role in mediating tissue damage after brain ischemia-reperfusion. Brain tissue is specifically vulnerable to the deleterious effects of oxidative stress because of its low capacity for cell division and repair. Since molecular oxygen is also the substrate of ROS generation, the dependence of this reaction on oxygen concentration has been studied by several groups, but mostly in hyperoxic/hyperbaric conditions, using mitochondria from liver and heart. Until now, the relationship between oxygen concentration and ROS production has never been carefully analyzed in intact brain mitochondria. This knowledge is of great importance for brain ischemia/reperfusion studies where the interplay between energy failure, oxygen availability and ROS generation is critical. To our knowledge, the effect of oxygen concentration on the rate of H2O2 release by intact brain mitochondria has only been analyzed under limited experimental settings, and only at supraphysiological oxygen concentrations. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of H2O2 release from intact mouse brain mitochondria and demonstrate that, under normal respiration, the release of H2O2 is directly proportional to oxygen concentration regardless of the respiratory substrates used. The highest rates of H2O2 release were registered under conditions of reverse electron transfer (RET). Our data also demonstrate that complex III is not a major contributor to ROS generation in physiological conditions. Antimycin A significantly stimulates complex III ROS production, and its oxygen dependence manifests Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics. We also found that, even in the absence of succinate, complex II can contribute to ROS generation when the quinone pool is reduced by glycerol 3-phosphate. Results Rates of H2O2 release by brain mitochondria at ambient oxygen concentration depend on respiratory substrates and the presence of respiratory chain inhibitors. Our goal was to investigate the effect of physiologically relevant oxygen concentrations on ROS production in intact brain mitochondria. First, we determined the rates of H2O2 release from mitochondria respiring at ambient oxygen (200μM [O2]) with different combinations of substrates. Rates of oxygen consumption and H2O2 release by intact brain mitochondria oxidizing malate/pyruvate, succinate/glutamate or succinate and glycerol 3-phosphate alone are summarized in Table 1. For each of three substrates combinations we measured H2O2 release in different respiratory states as well as in the presence of two specific respiratory chain inhibitors, rotenone and antimycin A. The highest rate of H2O2 release was observed in conditions of reverse electron transfer (RET) when the mitochondria have a high proton-motive force and oxidize succinate (with or without glutamate) or glycerol 3-phosphate (t-test, p<0.05, when compared to malate/pyruvate). During this process, the proton motive force drives complex I in reverse transferring electrons from the ubiquinol pool (generated from the complex II or GPDH substrates) to reduce NAD+. H2O2 release in RET was highly sensitive to the presence of ADP, which decreases the proton-motive force, or the complex I specific inhibitor rotenone, indicating that ROS release is at the level of complex I due to the RET. Addition of the complex III inhibitor antimycin A to mitochondria affected the rate of H2O2 release differently depending on the substrate used. Three distinct outcomes where observed. When malate/pyruvate were used as substrates, the rate of H2O2 release increased, whereas with succinate/glutamate the rate decreased. No change was observed when glycerol 3-phosphate was used as the substrate. An exceptionally high rate of ROS production was found during oxidation of glycerol 3-phosphate in the presence of antimycin A, pointing to the existence of an additional contributor to overall ROS production, besides complex III. Oxygen concentration affects H2O2 release by intact brain mitochondria. To assess the effect of oxygen concentration on H2O2 release, we implemented the experimental approach detailed below. Fig. 1 shows representative traces of the fluorescence signal of Amplex UltraRed (Fig. 1A, B, black traces) when oxygen concentration in the medium of respiring mitochondria was rapidly changed (Fig. 1A, B, blue traces). The fluorescence signal, which is proportional to the total H2O2 released, was differentiated with respect to time to give the rate of H2O2 release (red traces, Fig. 1C and D). Variation of oxygen concentration (from 0 to 200 μM) strongly affected the rate of H2O2 release. We observed two different patterns of H2O2 release rates in response to changing oxygen concentration. In the absence of antimycin (Fig 1C), H2O2 release rate (red trace) and oxygen concentration (blue dashed line) followed the same pattern whereas, in the presence of antimycin A (Fig. 1D), the trace of H2O2 release rate deviated from the trace of oxygen concentration. The recorded rate of H2O2 release was then plotted against oxygen concentration and fitted to the mathematical function (Fig. 1E, F). In the absence of antimycin A, we observed a linear dependence of H2O2 release rate on oxygen concentration (Fig. 1E), while the addition of antimycin A resulted in a non-linear curve that can be described as a sum of linear and hyperbolic functions (Fig. 1F). H2O2 release by intact brain mitochondria linearly depends on oxygen concentration We measured the oxygen dependence of H2O2 release by intact mitochondria oxidizing different substrates in the absence of any inhibitors of the respiratory chain. In non-phosphorylating respiring mitochondria the H2O2 release rate was linearly proportional to the oxygen concentration up to 200 μM for all substrates (Fig. 2A-C, open squares). The highest rate of H2O2 release was recorded in conditions of RET when mitochondria oxidize succinate in the presence of glutamate (Fig. 2B). Addition of ADP to respiring mitochondria stimulated oxidative phosphorylation (state 3), decreased proton-motive force (data not shown), and strongly diminished the rates of H2O2 release for all substrates. The residual H2O2 release in the presence of ADP was only 10% of the RET-supported ROS production (Fig 1B, C). The linear dependence of H2O2 release on oxygen concentration, however, remained (Fig. 2A-C, open triangles). Antimycin A, but not rotenone, introduces non-linearity to the oxygen dependence of the H2O2 release rate. We then tested the effects of two classical inhibitors of complex I and III - rotenone and antimycin A, respectively - on H2O2 release rate at different oxygen concentrations. Addition of rotenone to mitochondria increased H2O2 release when respiring on malate and pyruvate and decreased it in conditions of RET (Table 1, Fig. 3A-C, solid triangles). In all these conditions, the linear oxygen dependences were preserved. Surprisingly, with all substrates, in the presence of antimycin A, the oxygen dependence of H2O2 release displayed more complex kinetics (Fig. 3A-C, solid squares). The function of oxygen dependence under these conditions is described as a sum of linear and hyperbolic terms by Eq. 2. For malate/pyruvate-based respiration the quantitative analysis of the fitting curve (Fig. 3A, solid squares) shows that the addition of antimycin A results in the appearance of the hyperbolic component with an apparent Km for oxygen of 12.7±0.4 μM. These results seem to indicate that, in the presence of antimycin A, ROS generation at complex III manifests itself with classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics for oxygen. At the same time, the linear term of the Eq. 2 quantitatively corresponded to the slope in the presence of rotenone (Fig 3A, triangles, 1.3±0.1 pmol H2O2/min/mg protein per μM [O2]). For succinate/glutamate-based respiration (Fig. 3B, solid squares), the addition of antimycin A gave rise to the hyperbolic component with an apparent Km of 6.9±0.4 μM [O2]. The linear term (with the slope of 1.00±0.01 pmol H2O2/min/mg protein per μM [O2]) corresponded to the rate during respiration in state 3 (Fig. 2B, open triangles, 0.60±0.02 pmol H2O2/min/mg protein per μM [O2]). Therefore, in the presence of antimycin A, the hyperbolic dependence originates from complex III while the linear component is provided by the activity of the respiratory chain operating in the absence of a proton motive force upstream of the block imposed by the inhibitor. For glycerol 3-phosphate-based respiration, the addition of antimycin A also resulted in a mixed hyperbolic and linear dependence pattern (Fig. 3C, solid squares). The apparent Km value for the first component was 5.9±0.3 μM [O2]. The slope of the linear term was 2.2±0.1 pmol H2O2/min/mg protein per μM [O2], most likely corresponding to the production of ROS by the enzymes upstream of the antimycin A block in the absence of proton-motive force. Oxidation of glycerol 3-phosphate and H2O2 release. As shown previously, mitochondrial GPDH located on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane can generate ROS at a significant rate. Activity of GPDH is strongly dependent on the concentration of the substrate. We also found that both oxidation of glycerol 3-phosphate (Fig. 4A) and H2O2 release (Fig. 4B) depended on the concentration of the substrate in the millimolar range. We tested the effect of complex II inhibition on the rate of H2O2 release when mitochondria are oxidizing glycerol 3-phosphate. These experiments were carried out in the presence of rotenone to prevent RET-induced H2O2 release, and we used atpenin A5, a potent inhibitor of complex II, to block electron transfer at the ubiquinone binding site of the enzyme. In all tested conditions the rate of H2O2 release was decreased by the addition of atpenin (Fig 4C-E). The effect of complex II inhibition was less pronounced when the mitochondrial membrane potential was collapsed with an uncoupler (Fig. 5D) and more pronounced when quinone pool was fully reduced by inhibiting complex III with myxothizol (Fig. 4E). Complex II contribution calculated from an atpenin-sensitive fraction of total H2O2 release was around 21% during non-phosphorylating respiration (Fig 4C), and the addition of uncoupler decreased it to only 17% (Fig. 4D). In the presence of myxothiazol, complex II contribution was half of the total H2O2 release rate. Therefore, in isolated brain mitochondria, complex II can contribute to overall H2O2 release, even in the absence of succinate.",1742
27032290,"Introduction Cytochrome bc1 (mitochondrial complex III), a part of electron transport chain (ETC), is involved in building of proton motive force which is utilized to produce ATP. This protein is a homodimer, in which each monomer contains from 3 to 11 subunits, depending on species. The catalytic core of this protein consists of only 3 subunits: cytochrome b, cytochrome c1 and iron–sulfur protein (ISP). Its function is related to electron transfer from quinol to cytochrome c and the translocation of protons across the membrane. Communication between these two pools of electron carriers is important for energetic efficiency of ETC. In the catalytic Q cycle of cytochrome bc1 , a complete cycle of reactions occurs in two chains of cofactors embedded in the catalytic core. In the high-potential c-chain, quinol oxidation site (Qo site) is connected with cytochrome c reduction site by two cofactors: Rieske cluster and heme c1, embedded in ISP and cytochrome c1, respectively. Movement of the head domain of iron–sulfur protein (ISP-HD) between a site close to the Qo site (Qo position) and a site on the cytochrome c1 interface (c1 position) allows transfer of electrons via this chain. In the low-potential b-chain the Qo site is connected with quinone reduction site (Qi site) by heme bL and heme bH embedded in cytochrome b. Completion of the Q cycle requires two quinol molecules to be oxidized at the Qo site. After oxidation of first molecule of quinol at the Qo site one electron is transferred via high-potential c-chain and is used to reduce one molecule of cytochrome c. The second electron derived from oxidation of first molecule of quinol is transferred via low-potential b-chain and is used to reduce quinone to semiquinone at the Qi site. Electrons derived from oxidation of second quinol molecule are used to reduce one molecule of cytochrome c at the cytochrome c reduction site and to reduce semiquinone to quinol at the Qi site. In addition, a cross-dimer electron transfer at the level of two hemes bL is possible. Each monomer of the human cytochrome bc1 complex is composed of 11 subunits. Among all of them, only cytochrome b is encoded by mitochondrial DNA, whereas all the other subunits are of nuclear origin. Numerous cytochrome b mutations identified so far are related with diseases such as exercise intolerance, miopathy, cardiomiopathy and neuropathies. These mutations mostly exhibit a deficiency in the enzymatic activity and decreased amount of some of complex III subunits. Some mutations may also cause an increase in superoxide radical production. To study the molecular effects of human mitochondrial disease-related cytochrome b mutations, bacterial or yeast systems are used. In the present study we have used the Rhodobacter capsulatus bacterial model to examine the molecular effects of mitochondrial mutation G290D, which was identified in patient suffering from progressive exercise intolerance. Earlier study of mitochondria isolated from this patient's muscle showed a deficiency in the enzymatic activity of cytochrome bc1 and decreased amounts of some subunits: cytochrome b and ISP among others, while amounts of cytochrome c1 were normal. Gly-290 position in cytochrome b is highly conserved among the species. It is localised in the transmembrane helix F in the proximity of the Qo catalytic site but also in close contact with ISP-HD at the Qo position (Fig. 1). The mutation in R. capsulatus equivalent to human G290D is G332D. The change from glycine to aspartic acid introduces structural change (bulkier side chain) and additional negative charge. It thus might perturb the structure of the Qo site pocket and/or affect the interaction of ISP-HD with cytochrome b, which could influence the overall motion of ISP-HD. Recently, we found that another mitochondrial disease-related mutation G167P, located as G332D at the cytochrome b-ISP-HD interface, did affect the motion of ISP-HD which, among other effects, led to increased levels of superoxide production at the Qo site. In light of these findings we considered here G332D as a good candidate for the comparative analysis with G167P. Results G332D mutation affects the bc1-dependent growth of R. capsulatus One of the ways to test the functionality of mutated cytochrome bc1 in bacteria is to observe its ability to sustain growth under the photosynthetic conditions. As the anoxygenic growth of R. capsulatus is dependent on the functional electron transport chain, the lower growth rate of bacteria bearing mutated cytochrome bc1 complex suggests impediments in the complex operation. Upon introducing the G332D mutation in the cytochrome b in R. capsulatus we observed that the growth rate of mutated bacteria was dramatically slower than in the wild type (Fig. 2A). When both strains were seeded in the same amount, the growth of G332D could not be detected even after 7 days of culture. However, when the mutated bacteria were seeded at 10-fold higher concentration, some growth was observed (Fig. 2A). Under aerobic conditions, independent of functional bc1, the G332D bacteria exhibited growth rate comparable with the wild type (data not shown). G332D mutant shows native-like subunit composition and optical spectra of hemes To test whether the G332D mutation affects the subunit composition of the bc1 complex we purified the complex using affinity chromatography. Visualization of the purified proteins on the SDS gel revealed that in R. capsulatus the mutated complex consists of all three catalytic subunits — cytochrome b, cytochrome c1 and ISP (Fig. 2B). We have also investigated the spectral properties of purified bc1 complexes bearing the G332D mutation in comparison to the native enzyme. Thus we measured optical absorption spectra of these proteins under various oxidative and reducing conditions (Fig. 2C). The spectra of oxidized hemes b and hemes c, obtained in the presence of 1 mM sodium ferricyanide (red traces) did not differ between G332D and WT. Addition of sodium ascorbate reduced heme c in G332D (appearance of absorption peak at 551 nm (Fig. 2C, black traces)) indicating that this heme is high potential as in the native enzyme. Addition of potassium dithionite resulted in both WT and G332D in the additional maximum of absorption at 560 nm (Fig. 2C, green traces) corresponding to low-potential hemes b. Moreover, the peak-to-peak ratio on dithionite-reduced spectra of G332D (551 nm: 560 nm) did not reveal any significant changes in comparison to WT indicating that the ratio of hemes c to b in the mutant bc1 complex was not changed. G332D mutant exhibits lower enzymatic activity than wild type bc1 complex The measurements of enzymatic activity at 20 μM cytochrome c and 20 μM quinol revealed that isolated bc1 complex bearing G332D mutation is approximately 3-fold less active than the wild type (Table 1). The same result of decrease enzymatic activity was obtained by measuring Vmax for different concentrations of quinol with 20 μM cytochrome c (Fig. 3). When compared to the WT, G332D mutant exhibited 3-fold decline in Vmax (45 ± 2 s− 1 and 146 ± 9 s− 1 for G332D and WT, respectively) and 2-fold decline in KM (1.1 ± 0.2 μM and 2.3 ± 0.5 μM for G332D and WT, respectively). Using flash-induced double wavelength spectrophotometry we were able to monitor the redox reactions of heme cofactors within the bc1 complex in chrompatophores. Kinetic transients showed in Fig. 4 represent oxidation and reduction of hemes as a result of light-activated electron transfer through cofactor chains during the Q cycle. Transients of hemes b (Fig. 4A) obtained for G332D chromatophores in the presence of antimycin (red traces) indicate lower reduction rate in comparison to wild type (approximately 6-fold, Table 1). Also the rates of cytochrome c re-reduction are significantly slower for G332D mutant compared to WT both for non-inhibited (Fig. 4B, black traces) and antimycin-inhibited samples (Fig. 4B, red traces). G332D mutation changes CW EPR spectrum of [2Fe–2S] cluster and affects the equilibrium position of ISP-HD Fig. 5 compares continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW EPR) spectra of WT and G332D mutant. Clearly, the characteristic resonance transition gx = 1.80, reflecting the interactions of the reduced Rieske cluster with quinone in the Qo site of the wild type complex was not observed in the G332D mutant (Fig. 5A). The spectrum of non-inhibited G332D mutant exhibited a gx transition of 1.76, which is similar to a spectrum of WT after quinone extraction (empty Qo site). Moreover, addition of myxothiazol did not alter the shape of G332D spectrum. To investigate whether the presence of G332D influences the movement of the ISP-HD, which could be one of the reasons for the observed changes in the CW EPR spectra of [2Fe–2S] cluster in this mutant, we measured the temperature-dependence of phase relaxation rates of the cluster in wild type and in G332D cytochrome bc1. These measurements monitor the distance-dependent interactions between the [2Fe–2S] cluster and heme bL. The oxidized heme bL can enhance the relaxation of reduced Rieske cluster in such a way that the closer these two paramagnetic centres are, the stronger the enhancement of phase relaxation is. We have successfully used this approach to estimate changes in the average position of [2Fe–2S] cluster in relation to other cofactors in the native enzyme and various mutants of R. capsulatus cytochrome bc1 . Comparison of the relaxation rate profiles of non-inhibited wild type and G332D in Fig. 6A revealed weaker enhancement in the mutant. This indicates that the average equilibrium position of [2Fe–2S] cluster is shifted in G332D towards a c1 position, more remote from heme bL. In the presence of antimycin, G332D exhibited further decrease in relaxation rate (Fig. 6B) reminiscent of an even larger shift in the average position of the cluster away from the Qo site. Similar structural effect was observed in the antimycin–inhibited wild type (Fig. 6C), as recognized earlier by this method and in the EPR studies on oriented chromatophore membranes. As the additional charge on the surface of cytochrome b in G332D mutant can possibly affect electrostatics of interaction between cytochrome b and ISP-HD, we measured CW EPR spectra of ISP in chromatophores in buffers with different concentration of NaCl. Interestingly, the increase of ionic strength resulted in the slight, but clearly distinguishable appearance of gx = 1.80 transition at the expense of gx = 1.76 transition (Fig. 5B). For the highest NaCl concentration (400 mM) the contribution of cytochrome bc1 complexes exhibiting the gx = 1.80 transition (characteristic for native-like interaction of ISP-HD with the Qo site) could be estimated for 2–4% of the whole population. G332D mutation results in increased reactive oxygen species production in the presence of antimycin The increased distance between Rieske cluster and the Qo site is one of the conditions promoting generation of superoxide by cytochrome bc1 . Moreover, ROS production is influenced by the redox state of the quinone pool (the Q pool) exhibiting the characteristic bell-shaped dependence. In the absence of any inhibitors, we could not detect any ROS in G332D mutant by the SOD-dependent measurements of superoxide production under variety of redox conditions: when the redox state of the Q pool became more oxidized (by decreasing the ratio of quinol to Q pool) the enzymatic activity of G332D cytochrome bc1 decreased to the same levels, regardless of the SOD presence (Fig. 7A). However, after addition of antimycin the superoxide production was detected at level exceeding that typically observed in WT under the same conditions (, see also Fig. 7B). We thus compared the dependence of ROS generation in various redox states of the Q pool in antimycin-inhibited G332D and antimycin-inhibited WT. With increasing oxidation of the Q pool the amount of superoxide generation described “relatively” as a percentage of superoxide generated per single turnover increased for WT and G332D mutant (Fig. 7B). The difference in percentage of superoxide production between mutant and WT was more pronounced with the Q pool totally reduced (fraction of DBH2 = 1). Under this condition, G332D mutant revealed approximately 2-fold higher level of antimycin-dependent ROS generation than the WT (30% vs 17%, Fig. 7B). In antimycin-inhibited WT, the dependence of superoxide generation rate (described “quantitatively” as a number of μmol of superoxide produced by 1 μmol of the enzyme per second) was bell-shaped with the maximum ROS generation at a quinol to Q pool ratio of approximately 0.75 (Fig. 7C, black), consistent with previous observations. However, the G332D mutant did not show such bell-shaped dependence (Fig. 7C, red). This observation prompted us to examine antimycin-inhibited G167P, the mutant which without antimycin exhibited WT-like bell-shaped dependence. Antimycin-inhibited G167P lacked the bell-shaped dependence (Fig. 7C, blue), similarly to antimycin-inhibited G332D.",2030

26245902,"Introduction Cytochrome bc1 is a key component of the electron transport chain (for a recent review, see Ref.). It catalyzes the reaction of reduction of cytochrome c by quinol. Its action is related to building a proton-motive force, which is utilized to produce ATP. As a part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, cytochrome bc1 (complex III) plays a crucial role in oxidative phosphorylation. In the catalytic Q cycle of cytochrome bc1, energy connected with quinol to cytochrome c electron flow is utilized for proton translocation. In this case, electrons derived from the quinol oxidation are split at the Qo catalytic site into two different cofactor chains: high potential c-chain (which includes Rieske cluster, heme c1, and heme c embedded in iron-sulfur protein (ISP),3 cytochrome c1, and diffusible substrate cytochrome c, respectively) and low potential b-chain (which includes heme bL, heme bH, and the quinone reduction Qi site embedded in cytochrome b subunit) (Fig. 1A). Electrons transferred via the b-chain reduce quinone in the Qi site in two sequential steps. Transfer of electrons via the c-chain is made possible by movement of the head domain of iron-sulfur protein (ISP-HD), an important mechanistic element of the cytochrome bc1. ISP-HD moves between a site on the cytochrome b interface close to the Qo site (Qo position) and a site on the cytochrome c1 interface (c1 position). Unstable semiquinone is frequently discussed as an intermediate of the Qo site reaction. Recent experiments have trapped semiquinone in this site in the state of a free radical or as a semiquinone coupled to the reduced Rieske cluster. However, under certain conditions, part of the energy released from oxidation of quinol can be dissipated through side reactions that result in partial or total loss of proton translocation function of cytochrome bc1. These reactions reduce the efficiency of separation of electrons in the Qo site into two cofactor chains. One of the possible side reactions is an electron transfer from semiquinone generated in the Qo site to oxygen to produce superoxide. This reaction causes a decrease in the yield of proton translocation and results in formation of free radicals that could cause damage to certain macromolecules including lipids and proteins. Under some specific conditions, when the electron flow through cofactor chains is impeded, the side reactions in which superoxide is generated may be enhanced. For example, the presence of antimycin blocks the electron flow through the Qi site and favors reverse electron transfer from heme bL to quinone with formation of semiquinone in the Qo site. The formed semiquinone can react with ISP if ISP-HD is at the Qo position, or it can react with oxygen if ISP-HD is not present in the Qo site. Therefore states of the Qo site with ISP-HD not present at this site favor superoxide production. Among all subunits of complex III, only cytochrome b is encoded by mtDNA. Thus the probability of the occurrence of mutations in this subunit is higher compared with other subunits of the complex encoded by nDNA. In principle, such mutations may have various effects on function including adaptive effects proposed for mutations in humans: T15204C (I153T), T14798C (F18L), and G15257A (D171N) found in haplogroup C, J1, and J2, respectively. Nevertheless, most of the mutations identified so far in human cytochrome b appear to be linked with diseases such as exercise intolerance, myopathy, and cardiomyopathy. They all are somehow related to reduced efficiency of energy conversion, which could be caused by altered operation of mutated complex III. However, studying the molecular effects of these mutations in humans is often difficult, especially in the context of the occurrence of heteroplasmy and limited amount of protein that can be obtained from human cells. Those types of limitations can be overcome when using bacterial or yeast systems, which thus provide a good model to study human mitochondrial disease-related mutations at the molecular level. Conversely, the identified effects of certain human mutations can be a valuable source of general information on mechanisms of catalytic and side reactions. This approach was undertaken in the present study. We chose mutation T15197C (in the mtDNA sequence) identified in patients with exercise intolerance. This mutation changes serine 151 to proline in the vicinity of the Qo site and was found to result in expression of complex III with slightly reduced amounts of cytochrome b and cytochrome c1. In a yeast model, the analogous mutation (S152P) resulted in expression of complex III with significantly reduced amounts of ISP subunit. We show that this mutation introduced at an analogous position to the cytochrome b subunit (G167P) of bacterial cytochrome bc1 influences the average position of ISP-HD with respect to other subunits in such a way that it stays more remote from the Qo site than in the native enzyme. At the same time, no changes in the amounts of subunits in the catalytic core were observed. This provided new insight into the possible molecular basis of the human disease associated with the presence of T15197C. It also provided the first (to our knowledge) mutational variant of cytochrome bc1 in which a shift of ISP out of the Qo site was identified spectroscopically. This allowed us to extend the array of conditions that tested changes in the levels of superoxide production by cytochrome bc1 toward a better understanding of the mechanism of this reaction. Results Spectral and Kinetic Properties of G167P in Cytochrome b As shown in Fig. 1C, Gly-167 in R. capsulatus cytochrome b is located at the end of helix cd1 close to the twist loop that separates this helix from helix cd2. This region is at the entry of the Qo quinol binding pocket and comes in close contact with ISP-HD when it approaches cytochrome b. In mitochondrial complex III, the corresponding position is occupied by Ser (Ser-151). Introducing Pro at this position (G167P) results in expression of cytochrome bc1 in R. capsulatus cells that contains all catalytic subunits (cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and ISP) as visualized on SDS gels (Fig. 2A). However, G167P mutant is not functional in vivo as indicated by the incapability of cells to sustain cytochrome bc1-dependent photosynthetic growth (Fig. 3 and Table 1). This correlates with low enzymatic activity of the mutant (turnover rate of 14.7 versus 140 s−1 in WT) and severe impediments in the operation of the Qo site identified by light-induced kinetic measurements. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B, red trace), the Qo site-mediated reduction of hemes b in the presence of antimycin is greatly inhibited in G167P (Table 1). In the absence of inhibitors, the reduction of hemes b through the Qo site and reoxidation through the Qi site takes place (Fig. 4, A and B, black trace) but because of the much slower rate of heme b reduction is not kinetically resolved as in WT and only visualized as the difference between the black and red traces in Fig. 4B. Overall, the enzymatic assays and light-induced measurements indicate severe, but not complete, inhibition of the Qo site in G167P. The optical spectra of hemes b and c in the G167P mutant do not differ from the spectra of native complex (Fig. 2B). They exhibit an ascorbate-reducible peak at 553 nm (reflecting high potential heme c1) and dithionite-reducible peaks at 553 and 560 nm (the latter one reflecting the low potential hemes bL and bH). Conversely, the CW EPR spectra of the Rieske cluster in G167P clearly differed from that of the cluster in WT cytochrome bc1 (Fig. 2C): the gx transition in the mutant is much broadened and of a smaller amplitude as compared with the sharp and characteristic gx = 1.805 present in WT. In addition, the gx in G167P appears to be composed of more than one component (see also the spectrum of G167P in Fig. 7). This change in the shape of the spectrum provides the first indication that the interaction between the Rieske cluster and quinone in the Qo site is altered due to changes in the occupancy of the site with quinone and/or changes in the position of ISP-HD caused by structural constraints affecting the motion of this domain. Those types of changes would provide an explanation for the enzymatic and kinetic impediments observed in G167P. The gx transition remains sensitive to the addition of Qo site-specific inhibitors stigmatellin and myxothiazol (Fig. 2C). The shape of gx in the presence of these inhibitors in G167P is similar to that of native complex: in both cases, stigmatellin induces sharp gx at 1.783, whereas myxothiazol largely broadens this transition, shifting it to a value of gx = 1.763. Phase Relaxation of Rieske Cluster in G167P To get further insights into the molecular effects of G167P, we performed analysis of the temperature dependence of the phase relaxation rate of the Rieske cluster. Our previous studies showed that changes in phase relaxation rate reflect changes in the position of ISP-HD. More specifically, at the macroscopic level of the protein solution, they reflect changes in the average equilibrium position of ISP-HD with respect to other subunits of the complex. This approach benefits from the observation that oxidized heme bL enhances the relaxation in a distance-dependent manner: the closer the [2Fe-2S] cluster to heme bL, the stronger the enhancement. This means that the movement of ISP-HD out of the Qo site resulting in an increase of distance between heme bL and Rieske cluster weakens the enhancement. A comparison of the temperature dependence profiles of the phase relaxation rate of the Rieske cluster shown in Fig. 5A reveals that the enhancement in G167P is weaker compared with WT. This indicates that in G167P the average equilibrium position of ISP-HD is set at a larger distance from heme bL (and the Qo site) than in WT (Fig. 6, right versus middle). In other words, G167P causes a shift in the equilibrium position of ISP-HD toward positions more remote from the Qo site. Reversions When incubated under photosynthetic conditions, a photosynthetically inactive strain carrying G167P reverts spontaneously to photosynthetically competent cells (see Fig. 3). The DNA analysis of the revertant cells revealed that they are same site revertants and replace Pro at 167 with Ser or Gln (of eight clones analyzed, seven introduced Ser (generating mutant G167S) and one introduced Gln (generating mutant G167Q)). The enzymatic assays and kinetic data indicated that both G167S and G167Q regain much of their electron transfer activity compared with the original G167P. However, compared with WT, G167Q still exhibits about 2 times slower enzymatic turnover and rate of flash-induced heme b reduction, whereas G167S in both measurements approaches the WT level (Table 1). It is of note that position 167 is naturally occupied by Ser in several species including humans (corresponding position is Ser-151). High electron transfer activity of G167S is consistent with this observation. Effects of Combination of G167P in Cytochrome b with 1Ala and 2Ala Insertions in the Neck Region of ISP Subunit It was previously recognized that alanine insertion (1Ala or 2Ala) in the neck region connecting the ISP-HD with its hydrophobic anchor introduces steric constrains to the motion of ISP-HD. As a result, ISP-HD stays captured at the Qo site for milliseconds in 1Ala mutant or seconds in 2Ala mutant, which is a much longer time than in WT (microseconds or less). Therefore, in solution containing 1Ala or 2Ala mutants, there is an increase in the population of complexes having ISP-HD at the Qo site. In this context, a direction of the shift in the average position of ISP-HD caused by G167P can be considered opposite to the one caused by 1Ala or 2Ala mutants (Fig. 6). This prompted us to analyze the effect of a combination of G167P and alanine insertions in two double mutants, G167P/1Ala and G167P/2Ala. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, both mutants, unlike G167P, can grow under photosynthetic conditions. Clearly, either 1Ala or 2Ala can suppress effects caused by G167P. However, the growth of G167P/1Ala is more vigorous than that of G167P/2Ala, indicating that the former combination of mutations yields cytochrome bc1 that operates more efficiently. This difference finds its roots in the different phenotypic properties of the original Ala insertions: 1Ala is photosynthetically active, whereas 2Ala is not (Table 1). Thus, although in the case of G167P/1Ala an addition of the Ps+ mutation (1Ala) to the Ps− mutation (G167P) rendered the double mutant Ps+, in the case of G167P/2Ala, a weak Ps+ phenotype was achieved by combining the two mutations that originally were Ps− (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The enzymatic activities and measured rates of light-induced electron transfer in the double mutants seem consistent with their phenotypic properties (Fig. 4 and Table 1). G167P/2Ala shows a slight increase in the turnover rate and rate of light-induced heme b reduction as compared with G167P. However, changes in G167P/2Ala are more dramatic in relation to the 2Ala mutant, which has a very low enzymatic activity (turnover of around 4 s−1) and no signs of millisecond heme b reduction under the conditions described in Fig. 4 (G167P/2Ala displays a 5 times higher turnover rate and a clear millisecond reduction of heme b). G167P/1Ala shows a further increase in both the enzymatic activities and heme b reduction compared with G167P/2Ala (Table 1). However, the extent of the increase is clearly larger for heme b reduction than for enzymatic activity. The same trend is also observed when G167P/1Ala is compared with G167P: the rate of flash-induced heme b reduction increases about an order of magnitude, whereas the enzymatic activity increases only 2 times (Table 1). In fact, the rate of heme b reduction in G167P/1Ala reaches the level observed in 1Ala; however, the enzymatic activity of 1Ala is about 4 times higher compared with G167P/1Ala. This makes G167P/1Ala an interesting example of a combination of mutations exerting more severe inhibitory effects under the conditions of multiple turnover than under the conditions of flash-induced electron transfer. As seen in the EPR spectra of Fig. 7, the heterogeneity of gx transition originally observed in G167P is more pronounced in G167P/1Ala and G167P/2Ala. The gx in EPR spectra of both double mutants allows for the distinction of two transitions (1.805 and 1.772). If gx = 1.805 is taken into account, one can see an increase in the amplitude in the following order: G167P, G167P/1Ala, G167P/2Ala, WT. As the characteristic shape of gx = 1.805 in WT is usually assigned as reflecting interaction of reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster with quinone bound in the Qo site, the increase in the amplitude of gx = 1.805 in double mutants in comparison with G167P suggests that in those mutants the population of ISP-HD occupying the Qo position is larger. This seems to follow the expectations based on the opposing effects of 1Ala or 2Ala and G167P. However, it is important to emphasize that the shape of the EPR spectrum in chromatophores frozen without glycerol may not necessarily reflect the distribution of positions of ISP-HD as best evidenced in 1Ala and 2Ala mutants, which both have EPR spectra similar in shape to WT but exert large effects on distribution of ISP-HD positions (Figs. 5B and 7). Conversely, the increase in gx in double mutants points toward the possibility that the change in the shape of EPR spectrum of G167P alone (Fig. 7) is caused by the remoteness of ISP-HD from the Qo site rather than the absence of quinone bound at the Qo site (provided that 2Ala or 1Ala does not change the affinity of Qo site for its substrate in G167P). To get insights into the effects of G167P/1Ala and G167P/2Ala on the distribution of positions of ISP-HD, we compared the temperature dependence profiles of the phase relaxation rate of the Rieske cluster in those mutants, taking the profiles of 2Ala, 1Ala, and WT as a reference (Fig. 5B). The strongest enhancement observed in the 2Ala mutant reflects almost the entire population of ISP-HD at the Qo site. The enhancement in G167P/2Ala is weaker, indicating a decrease in the population of ISP-HD at the Qo site in this mutant. However, it stays above the level of enhancement seen in the 1Ala mutant, indicating that the population of ISP-HD at the Qo site in G167P/2Ala is larger than in 1Ala. The enhancement in G167P/1Ala is weaker than in 1Ala, indicating a further decrease in the population of ISP-HD at the Qo site. This population is still larger than in WT (enhancement in G167P/1Ala is larger). Overall, the decrease in the strength of the enhancement indicates a decrease in the population of ISP-HD at the Qo site and a shift in equilibrium position toward positions more remote from the Qo site. It appears as if on one hand 1Ala and 2Ala diminished the “pushing” of the ISP-HD out of the Qo site caused by G167P, and on the other hand, G167P diminished the pushing of the ISP-HD toward the Qo site caused by 1Ala and 2Ala. As a result, the average ISP-HD position in G167P/1Ala or G167P/2Ala became closer to the Qo site than in WT (and G167P) but did not reach proximity to the Qo site achieved in 1Ala or 2Ala, respectively. Considering all these effects, one can rank the mutations in the following order (with the first having the largest population of ISP-HD at the Qo site): 2Ala > G167P/2Ala > 1Ala > G167P/1Ala > WT > G167P. Table 1 shows that values of midpoint redox potential (Em) of the Rieske cluster in the mutants G167P, G167P/1Ala, and G167P/2Ala are similar to that of WT. This differentiates these mutants from the 1Ala and 2Ala mutants, which were previously shown to display an increase in Em of Rieske cluster in respect to WT (in particular, 2Ala displays an Em value about 100 mV higher than WT). Given that the Ala mutants generally increase the population of ISP-HD at the Qo site, their effect on Em is consistent with the notion that the Rieske cluster in/close to the Qo site has a higher Em if compared with its Em at other positions (an increase in Em is also observed in the presence of some inhibitors such as stigmatellin that fix the ISP-HD at the Qo site). In this context, the lack of an increase in Em8 of G167P, G167P/1Ala, and G167P/2Ala can be considered as additional support to the notion that a population of ISP-HD at the Qo site is generally decreased in all G167P mutants (i.e. even when Ala insertions are present). We note, however, that the origin of the changes in Em of the Rieske cluster is a complex issue as Em not only depends on the position of ISP-HD but on several other factors including occupancy of the Qo site with substrate/inhibitor. Thus, a change in a value of Em is not a simple translation to changes in ISP-HD position. A good example is provided by G167P/2Ala, which has a larger population of ISP-HD at the Qo site than 1Ala (Fig. 5B) but Em8 of Rieske cluster is not elevated (Table 1). Effect of G167P on Generation of Superoxide at the Qo Site of Cytochrome bc1 It was previously recognized that superoxide is generated at the Qo site in reactions involving a back electron transfer from heme bL to quinone. This leads to the formation of semiquinone, which has the highest probability of reacting with oxygen when ISP-HD occupies a position remote from the Qo site. It follows that mutations shifting the average equilibrium position of ISP-HD out of the Qo site should in principle enhance superoxide production by cytochrome bc1. G167P seemed a good candidate to test this assumption. Typically, production of superoxide in native cytochrome bc1 is observed when the inhibitor antimycin blocks the reoxidation of heme bH (and bL) via the Qi site. The measurements are performed in detergent solution with isolated enzyme exposed to an excess of substrate, cytochrome c and quinol. Our initial measurements indicated that under those types of conditions the G167P mutant generates even larger amounts of superoxide than the native cytochrome bc1 (30 versus 17% for G167P and WT, respectively). This prompted us to verify whether this mutant can generate superoxide in the absence of any inhibitor. However, the measurements performed with an excess of quinol (typical conditions of enzymatic assays) revealed only a little superoxide generated by G167P (less than 5%). We thus tested a variety of conditions where both quinol and quinone were present in the reaction mixture in various proportions. The results are shown in Fig. 8. The amount of superoxide generation is described “quantitatively” as a number of μmol of O2˙̄ produced by 1 μmol of the enzyme per second (Fig. 8B) or “relatively” as a percentage of superoxide generated per single turnover (Fig. 8C). Quantitatively, the superoxide generation shows a bell shape with the maximum at a quinol to quinone pool ratio of ∼70 to 30%. Changes of this proportion in any direction lead to a decrease of the total amount of superoxide generated per second. Relatively, a linear increase of superoxide generation is observed upon an increase of quinone and decrease of quinol. The bell shape of O2˙̄ generation (Fig. 8B) is a consequence of a balance between two opposite effects associated with oxidation of the Q pool: O2˙̄ per single turnover increases with increasing concentration of quinone, while at the same time, the total enzymatic turnover rate decreases (Fig. 8A). Under the conditions of maximum superoxide production per second observed for G167P, WT and mutants 2Ala and G167P/2Ala did not generate superoxide within experimental uncertainty (±S.E.) (Fig. 8D). The difference between mean values of enzymatic activities with and without SOD is shown for G167P (p value = 2 × 10−6, statistically significant result) and G167P/2Ala (p value = 0.22, not statistically significant result). The results for WT and 2Ala are consistent with previous observations described. To confirm enhanced production of superoxide in G167P mutant, we performed additional analysis using the Amplex Red horseradish peroxidase method (Fig. 9). We also observed that uninhibited G167P mutant produces a high level of superoxide, which was reflected in 10 times higher concentration of H2O2 measured for this mutant with respect to WT, 2Ala, or G167P/2Ala. We note that the background level of H2O2 observed for WT, 2Ala, and G167P/2Ala is consistent with the results reported for uninhibited complex III.",3710
19503808,"Introduction Mitochondria have long been implicated in the aging process. The electron transport chain (ETC), embedded within the inner membrane of the mitochondria, is the major producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are presumed to be the primary agent for cell damage and premature apoptosis, affecting aging and longevity. The primary intermediate responsible for producing the ROS superoxide is ubisemiquinone, the coenzyme Q (CoQ) radical produced in complexes I, II and III of the ETC. Reducing the production of ubisemiquinone in the ETC has been shown to reduce free radical levels and prolong life span in animals. The mechanism by which ROS affect aging and longevity has recently come under scrutiny (e.g.). For years the paradigm of aging (e.g.) has predicted that over time ROS leakage leads to accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and oxidative damage to the cell. Over the lifespan of an individual, the damage may then lead to premature cell death, followed by organ and tissue failure, which are characteristics of aging and associated degenerative disorders. The paradigm concludes that to avoid cumulative damage over time and increase longevity, antioxidants must be taken to combat oxidative stress on cell components. Recent studies indicate that these basic assumptions should be revisited. It has been shown that free radical leakage fluctuates according to the signals that ROS themselves produce. Further, antioxidants have been shown not to prolong lifespan (e.g.). Together, the ROS fluctuations and the lack of an antioxidant effect on longevity indicate that the role of free radicals in aging and longevity is more complex than previously thought. A theory of aging that accounts for a signaling role for endogenous free radicals in maintaining the metabolic status of the cell has been proposed, balancing their role in cellular damage. The underlying principles of this theory of aging include: 1) ROS leakage produces mtDNA mutations; 2) ROS produced by ailing mitochondria also signals cellular apoptosis activities; 3) when a threshold of both ailing mitochondria and ROS signals is reached, the cell prematurely commits to apoptosis followed by organ and tissue failure. Studies have shown that when a given mutation is found in different species it has varying effects based on the comparative rate of ROS leakage in the species. The threshold of ROS signal needed for the cell to commit apoptosis depends on the rate at which ROS are produced from the mitochondria. Intuition might suggest that the threshold of ROS signal needed for the cell to commit to apoptosis is static. However, it appears to be dependent upon the rate of ROS production from the mitochondria, exhibiting a tight correlation between mutations and a ROS-signal apoptotic threshold. Whether the role of free radicals in aging and longevity involves the toxicity of ROS over time or the important signaling role of ROS in programmed cell death, it is important that studies of longevity turn attention toward mechanisms by which ROS is produced in the respiratory chain of the mitochondria, and how leakage affects the cell and might be reduced. In this regard, it is also essential to come to an understanding of these mechanisms in the context of caloric intake, since electron input to the ETC may alter ROS production. It has been proposed that as mitochondria function in decreased phosphorylating modes, the ETC remains in a more reduced state (maximally occupied with electrons) for longer time periods, increasing the production of ubisemiquinone and ROS, thereby decreasing longevity. The major contributor toward a more reduced state is excessive calorie consumption (increased electron input), but other factors can exacerbate the problem as well. For example, the ETC may remain more reduced because of inhibition or dysfunction of ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation, blocking the electron flow of the respiratory chain. Reduced ADP, caused by a lack of physical exercise (during which ADP is not present because ATP is not being used), may also inhibit the turning over of electrons and keep the ETC more reduced. As the electron flow is inhibited, not only do more reactive electrons accumulate, but oxygen levels increase as well. This may increase the probability that backed up electrons and oxygen will react and produce free radicals. The electron transport chain is composed of protein complexes whose individual protein subunits are encoded in either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in any of the genes encoding ETC subunits could alter the quality of electron flow or affect CoQ binding sites, and subsequently affect ROS production, aging and longevity. Mitochondria have maintained a core set of genes that encode essential proteins in the ETC. Nonsynonymous mutations in these genes have the potential to affect the ETC, ROS production and longevity in a way that is dependent upon calorie restriction and/or calorie over-consumption. Throughout the last 150 years there have been dramatic extremes in per capita caloric intake. For example, during the Great Depression (1920–1940) many individuals throughout North America were under extremely restricted caloric intake. In more recent decades there has been an increase in caloric intake toward the other extreme, particularly in North America. If there is a relationship between the redox state of the ETC, longevity, mtDNA mutations and extremes of caloric intake, it could be demonstrated by an analysis of historical longevity within mtDNA haplogroups during extended and continental periods of calorie reduction and over-consumption. The human population is subdivided into mitochondrial haplogroups. Haplogroups are distinguished by a unique set of mitochondrial SNPs, the nonsynonymous of which are of interest in relationship to their potential effect on the mitochondrial respiratory chain and longevity. Many studies have demonstrated the association of certain mtDNA haplogroups with increased longevity (e.g.). We chose to focus on haplogroup H, which is one of the more recent haplogroups, but also now the most prevalent European mtDNA haplogroup, and compare historical longevity in closely related haplogroup U individuals under extremes of caloric intake.  Figure 1 shows the haplogroup relationship with regard to mtDNA mutations between H and U. Haplogroup H is separated from haplogroup U by mitochondrial SNP T14766C, which results in an amino acid substitution of a threonine for an isoleucine at amino acid site 7 in cytochrome b (cytb), which encodes the central catalytic enzyme of the mitochondrial protein complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex) of the ETC. In this study we first identify the difference in longevity in haplogroups H and U specifically during times of caloric restriction as well as times of calorie over-consumption. This is accomplished by identifying individuals with haplotype H and U from two genetic genealogy databases and collecting longevity information about their maternally related ancestors from the pedigrees in those databases. In addition, many of the ancestors were then found in a family history database, and longevity information was gathered about their extended maternal relatives who share their maternally inherited haplogroups H and U. The longevity data for haplogroups H and U were compared in cohorts of 20 year increments, with 1920–40 longevity representing historical calorie restriction, and 1960–80 and 1980-present representing caloric over-consumption. Next, we examined the biochemical shift that the polymorphism cytbI7T produces in cytb, protein complex III, and the ETC overall. We then estimate selective pressure on amino acid properties throughout mammalian evolution, particularly at site 7 in cytb, to gain a historical evolutionarily context of this region and a better perspective on how this recent human polymorphism may change the mitochondrial system. Finally, we correlate these data and present a mechanism by which cytbI7T may affect ETC efficiency and ROS production by complex III, and consequently longevity in haplogroup H during a restricted dietary environment compared to an environment of excessive caloric intake. Results Difference in Longevity between H and U The mean age at death was calculated for each time period cohort of individuals. To test for statistical difference between Haplogroup H and U, a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variances was performed on the means. Figure 2 shows the mean age at death for each time period cohort. We see an expected general increase in longevity during the 20th century in both haplogroups. Before 1920 there is no significant difference between the longevity of individuals in haplogroup H and U. During the caloric restriction of the Great Depression, 1920–1940, haplogroup H shows significant increase in longevity compared to haplogroup U (mean difference = 2.6 years, p = 0.02). This significant difference during caloric restriction is further illustrated by a survival curve of individuals in the two haplogroups during this two decade time period (Figure 3). Following 1940, there is little difference in longevity between Haplogroup H and U individuals. This lack of difference continues to include recent years of caloric over-consumption. CytbI7T TreeSAAP Results  Table 2 shows the TreeSAAP results for the single substitution cytbI7T. TreeSAAP indicated that substituting a threonine for an isoleucine at site 7 in cytb results in radical shifts in seven amino acid properties. The large number of properties of magnitude 6–8 (radical to extremely radical changes) that are associated with this polymorphism suggests a radical change in the resulting protein. These properties will be described in detail. Three properties relate to the level of hydrophilicity in the region. In general, the amino acid property “Surrounding Hydrophobicity” refers to the tendency for the region around the amino acid site in question to interact with water. In the case of cytbI7T, there is a radical decrease of magnitude 8 in this property, indicating that the region surrounding site 7 becomes less hydrophobic and more hydrophilic by introducing a threonine instead of an isoleucine. This biochemical shift is likely the result of the hydroxyl group on the R-group of threonine that may easily interact with water molecules. Isoleucine is hydrophobic and thus lacks this ability. Hydrophobicity is similar to the property “Hydropathy”, which also decreases due to the polymorphism I7T. “Equilibrium Constant” deals with the ability of any ionizable functional group of the residue to dissociate and make an ion. TreeSAAP indicates that cytbI7T increases this property by a moderately radical (magnitude 6) change. An increased equilibrium constant for the ionization of COOH would indicate a more product-driven reaction. This would, as in the other properties, make the region more water-soluble and hydrophilic. As will be noted, this may be of greatest importance regarding reduced ROS production and increased longevity during calorie restriction. The other four properties relate to the level of compactness in the region. The amino acid properties “Average Number of Surrounding Residues” and “Buriedness” measure how compact and buried the amino acid site is. TreeSAAP indicated that cytbI7T decreases both of these properties with a magnitude 6 change. With a decrease in these properties, we can imagine a region around site 7 that is more open and free to interact (as opposed to compact). This conclusion is further supported by the decrease in the amino acid property “Long-range non-bonded energy” resulting from cytbI7T. This property describes the interactions between molecules that are not directly in contact with one another (such as Van der Waals interactions), affecting the stability of molecules involved. It has been shown that the structures in globular proteins are influenced not only by local, bonding interactions, but also by long-range interactions. TreeSAAP indicated a radical decrease in this property of magnitude 6. A decrease in “Long-range non-bonded energy” indicates a decrease in stability in this residue and surrounding residues, further suggesting that the region around site 7 is more open, less globular, and less compact due to this polymorphism. The solvent accessible surface of a protein is the region where solvent and solutes interact with the protein. The amino acid property “Solvent Accessibility Reduction Ratio” is defined as the ratio of the solvent accessible surface area of a residue in the native state to that of the residue in an extended tri-peptide (Ala-X-Ala) conformation. All of these property changes involve either an increase in hydrophilicity or a decrease in compactness in the region surrounding site 7 in cytb among haplogroup H individuals. Mammalian Evolution TreeSAAP Results The second part of our analysis involved the use of TreeSAAP across the cytb sequences and phylogenetic tree of 107 mammalian species from all major mammalian lineages in order to estimate a historical evolutionary context of the amino acid properties that have been under selection for radical change at site 7 in cytb. Particularly, the amino acid properties that are changed by the cytbI7T polymorphism itself (Table 2) were inspected in the TreeSAAP results of 107 mammalian cytb sequences.  Figure 4 shows the TreeSAAP results across cytb that are consistent with the amino acid properties found by running the individual cytbI7T polymorphism through TreeSAAP. Though TreeSAAP found radical shifts in 7 amino acid properties while analyzing the individual cytbI7T polymorphism, only six of these were significantly affected in the mammalian data set – TreeSAAP did not detect evidence of adaptation for the property “Average Number of Surrounding Residues”. The peaks in the graphs of Figure 4 represent radical changes in those properties during phylogenesis at particular amino acid sites. Site 7 in cytb, where the polymorphism that distinguishes haplogroup H occurs, are marked in each graph. There are no peaks in any of these graphs at site 7, though there have been naturally occurring radical changes in these properties elsewhere along the sequence. This indicates that the 7 properties affected by cytbI7T have been highly conserved and stable at this site throughout the evolution of these 107 mammalian species. TreeSAAP results suggest that the region around site 7 likely was not a site of adaptation in hydrophilicity and compactness throughout mammalian evolution. This result, however, does not preclude positive selection at this site in the human lineage. Threonine was either fixed or maintained at cytb site 7 until a T7I mutation occurred that led to an isoleucine polymorphism in primates. Subsequent primates, including most human mitochondrial haplogroups, still exhibit isoleucine at site 7. Relatively recently, the human substitution cytbI7T occurred, forming haplogroup H. Radical physicochemical shifts in haplogroup H restore the historical pre-primate character state, suggesting that cytbI7T may have a positive effect. Given its location within protein complex III and the radical nature of the physicochemical effect, we are led to conclude that cytbI7T was likely advantageous relative to the precise efficiency of complex III and the respiratory chain that is linked to increased longevity during calorie restriction.",2378

29470286,"Introduction Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease in children and its prevalence is rising in relation to the increasing number of overweight and obese children. Prevalence of NAFLD may approach 11% of all children in some areas. NAFLD is often accompanied by insulin resistance and is considered by some to be the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. Hispanic boys are at increased risk for NAFLD as well as for obesity and its comorbidities, including the metabolic syndrome, making them a particularly vulnerable group. While the prevalence of obesity has stabilized in certain groups, it continues to increase in Hispanic boys. Further, severe obesity continues to increase in childhood with an associated increase in the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors, particularly in boys. Thus, understanding the genetic underpinnings of obesity and its comorbidities in Hispanic boys is particularly important. There is a significant genetic predilection to obesity, with estimates of heritability up to 70%. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer a powerful hypothesis-free approach to identify the location of potential genetic contributions to obesity and its metabolic consequences. Such studies have identified over 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with obesity in adults. Limited studies in children have validated some of the more significant genetic loci, including the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene. There are at least 15 candidate genes that have been associated with elevated hemoglobin A1C in adults, and a number of other potential loci. To our knowledge, no GWAS studies have been reported on solely obese children to examine loci associated with elevated hemoglobin A1C. No genetic variant studies have been performed on children with biopsy-proven NAFLD to determine associated genetic risk factors for adiposity and insulin resistance. The aim of the current study is to identify genetic loci associated with adiposity as measured by BMI z-score and markers of insulin resistance by homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and hemoglobin A1C (Hgb A1C) in a population of Hispanic boys with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD. Due to the high prevalence of co-morbidities in this at risk population, this group of boys serves as an appropriate discovery cohort. Results Subjects The baseline demographic characteristics, laboratory values, and histologic characteristics of the patient population were previously reported and the study subjects remain the same, as described in Table 1. The subjects were overweight/obese Hispanic boys with a median BMI of 31.4 kg/m2 and BMI z-score of 2.4. They were young adolescents with a median age of 12 years. Serum aminotransferases were elevated with a median ALT of 83 U/L and AST of 51 U/L. While only 4 boys had type 2 diabetes the subjects demonstrated signs of potential insulin resistance with a median insulin of 26 U/ml and Hgb A1C level of 5.3%. Lipid analysis revealed an abnormally low HDL with a median level of 38 mg/dL. The median levels for VLDL and LDL were within normal limits. Per the NASH CRN histology scoring system, the majority demonstrated significant steatosis with 71% having at least a steatosis grade of 2 (34–66%) according to NAS scoring, meaning at least 34% of hepatocytes demonstrated macrovesicular steatosis. As often found in pediatric populations, 59% of samples demonstrated no evidence of hepatocellular ballooning, a sign of cell injury necessary for the diagnosis of NASH. In terms of diagnostic pattern, 53% of subjects had evidence of borderline NASH and another 22% had definite NASH. Adiposity Manhattan plots from both the dominant and additive models for BMI z-score are shown in Figure 1. The dominant model resulted in 4 significant SNPs, one of which showed a previous association with adiposity, specifically CAMK1D (Table 2). All were located within introns. The allele on chromosome 10 in rs17583338 in the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID gene (CAMK1D) which codes for a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was of special interest. A qualitative model using linear regression was also found in association with BMI z-score (p=5 x 10−6, data not shown). Another allele was located in chromosome 2 in rs295120 in the spermatogenesis associated, serine-rich 2-like gene (SPATS2L) which codes for the uncharacterized protein, spermatogenesis associated, serine-rich 2-like. There was also an association with an allele on chromosome 5 in SNP rs2303752 in the sema domain, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain, (semaphorin) 6A gene (SEMA6A) which codes for the cell surface receptor semaporin-6A. The final association was with an allele on chromosome 11 in rs11026723 located in the growth arrest-specific 2 gene (GAS2) which codes for the growth arrest-specific protein 2, which may play a role in apoptosis. The additive model resulted in 7 SNPs of interest, none showing a previous association with adiposity in other populations (Table 2). Six were located within introns and another was located within an uncharacterized region. There was an association with 4 alleles on chromosome 2 in SNPs rs12619898, rs17397163, rs11687204 and rs17397380 all located within non coding regions of NCK-associated protein 5 gene (NCKAP5) which codes for the protein NCK–associated protein 5. Another 2 alleles were located in chromosome 2 in SNPs rs99521 and rs295120 in the spermatogenesis associated, serine-rich 2-like gene (SPATS2L) which codes for the uncharacterized spermatogenesis associated, serine-rich 2-like protein. This gene, and in fact one of the exact SNPs rs295120, was also identified in the dominant model. The final association was with an allele on chromosome 14 in SNP rs8005339 which is of unknown significance. Insulin Resistance The dominant models for HOMA-IR and Hgb A1C did not produce any significant results. Each of the additive models, on the other hand had a number of potentially intriguing findings. Manhattan plots for each of these models are in Figure 1(c) and (d). There were 6 significant SNPs associated with HOMA-IR, none of which has shown a previous association with insulin resistance in other populations (Table 2). Five were located within introns and another was located within an uncharacterized region. There was significance with an allele on chromosome 17 on rs11773571 in the Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosome region gene (WBSCR17) which codes for the putative polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-like protein 3 which may catalyze the initial reaction in oligosaccharide biosynthesis. Another association was with an allele on chromosome 3 on rs9846667 in the noncoding region of the family with sequence similarity 19 (chemokine [C-C motif-like], member A1) gene (FAM19A1) which codes for an uncharacterized protein. A third association was with an allele on chromosome 2 on rs10865041 in the intron of RFX family member 8, lacking RFX DNA binding domain gene (RFX8) which codes for the DNA-binding protein RFX8. A further association was on chromosome 20 in rs4361192 located in the intron of double zinc ribbon and ankyrin repeat domains gene (RFX8) which codes for double zinc ribbon and ankyrin repeat-containing protein 1. Another association on chromosome 20 was rs2295067 in the intron of LINC00851 which has unknown significance. The final association was with an allele on chromosome 16 in SNP rs8046133 which is of unknown significance. There were 3 significant SNPs associated with Hgb A1C where the minor allele frequency was greater than 0.05, none of which has shown a previous association with insulin resistance (Table 2). Two of the significant alleles were on chromosome 11, rs3923850 and rs11727927, both located in the introns of the opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like gene (OPCML) coding for opioid-binding cell adhesion molecule. The final association was with an allele on chromosome 16 in SNP rs11644684 which is of unknown significance.",1230
21333900,"Introduction As discussed in previous chapters, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort and diarrhea and/or constipation that can be associated with altered gastrointestinal motility and visceral sensation. The chronicity of IBS symptoms and the lack of a cure or effective treatments result in loss of work and school productivity and impaired personal and health-related quality of life. Patients, their relatives, and friends frequently ask difficult questions, such as why they developed IBS. Although diet, psychological factors, infection, and gut flora may attenuate IBS symptoms, there is no simple answer to this question. As other family members may concurrently have bowel disturbances, the role of genes in disease development—and the sense of personal destiny it invokes--is somewhat intuitive, easy to accept, but also difficult to refute with facts or objective findings arguing the contrary. Great advances have been made in the field of genetics in recent years. As the efficiency, ease, and cost of genotyping has decreased, our understanding of DNA sequence, structure, and function has improved dramatically. Previously, laboratory-based study of the human genome was often restricted to known genes and coding exon regions and study of a handful of genetic variants. Now, high-throughput technology allows genotyping of thousands to a million genetic markers across the genome and sequencing of nearly the entire [coding] human genome is now possible. Furthermore, advances in data storage and analysis of these large quantities of data has led to the discovery of susceptibility loci for a number of diseases including, notably, Crohn’s disease. These amazing scientific strides have led many to believe that “Virtually every human ailment, except perhaps trauma, has some basis in our genes.” (www.genome.gov). This premise has appealed to many IBS researchers and several have commenced in trying to identify an IBS gene, or set of genes. Despite the acceptance by some that genes may cause—or at least contribute to the development of—IBS, careful examination of the body of literature is necessary to determine whether there is sound basis for this theory as gene discovery still requires considerable time, effort, and thus, financial resources. Certainly, alternative hypotheses—such as environmental exposures—exist and can not be ignored as important players in IBS. This article will provide a summary of the studies around the competing hypotheses of “gene v. environment” or “nature v. nurture” in IBS. An overview of family studies, candidate gene studies, and alternative hypotheses for IBS will be covered to provide the reader an overview of the works conducted in this area. IBS as a complex genetic disorder Classic Mendelian genetics diseases are typically caused by a few highly penetrant genetic defects on a single gene and are transmitted in a typical pattern through families. Mendelian diseases follow an autosomal dominant, recessive, co-dominant, or X-linked pattern of transmission through pedigrees. Recent genetic studies have focused less on Mendelian disorders but on complex genetic diseases. A “complex genetic disease” is defined as a multifactorial genetic disorder resulting from multiple genetic variants on several genes (i.e. polygenic) with contributions from environment and lifestyle. These genetic effects are modest in that the presence of a specific variant is rarely sufficient on its own to result in disease development. Complex genetic diseases are still heritable in that they tend to aggregate in families, but not in the same predictable fashion as classic Mendelian disorders. Many common diseases of significant public health interest are thought to be complex disorders. Heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, autism, and mood disorders are a few of the diseases and disorders under study by geneticists and genetic epidemiologists. In gastroenterology, Crohn’s disease is the best example of a complex genetic disorder with successful susceptibility loci identification. Through a combination of family-based linkage studies, candidate gene and fine-mapping studies, as well as genome-wide association studies have led to the identification of several genes—such as NOD2, ATG16L1, IL23, IL12B, STAT3, NKX2-3—found to be consistently associated with Crohn’s disease. These discoveries offer the promise that if gene discovery was possible in this complex gastrointestinal disorder, that successful gene discovery is feasible in other multifactorial disorders and diseases including IBS. Despite the discovery of several genetic loci involved in Crohn’s disease development, it is clear that genes alone do not cause the disease and that environmental contributions—such as diet, smoking, early exposure to infectious organisms, and colonic microflora--are still important. A similar gene-environment paradigm could be proposed for IBS (Figure 1) where a combination of genetic factors and environmental factors result in the alterations in gastrointestinal sensation and motor function that ultimately result in symptom manifestation. Genetic variation in genes that encode proteins that regulate gender-based biological processes, control or modulate central or peripheral sensation and motility, or even regulate brain response to stress would be the obvious first candidates for IBS. These factors, interacting with environmental factors such as diet, infection, early life trauma and stress, are likely responsible for the overall IBS phenotype. However, the specific combinations of genetic variants and environmental factors likely can in part explain the clinical heterogeneity of IBS. Hence, it is conceivable and likely that there are different genes responsible for diarrhea than those responsible for constipation, and other genetic variants that predispose an individual to developing or sensing abdominal pain required for IBS that is not generally present in the non-painful functional disorders such as functional constipation and functional diarrhea. Exploring gene-environment interactions will be important if one postulates that IBS is a multifactorial, polygenic complex genetic disorder. IBS and heritability Genetic diseases—complex or Mendelian—must run in families. Several studies of patients with IBS suggest that this disorder aggregates in families, and thus, appears potentially heritable. Children with persistent recurrent abdominal pain who were found to report IBS-like symptoms as adults were almost three-fold as likely to have at least one sibling with similar symptoms when compared to children-now-adults without IBS-like symptoms (40% v. 6%, p<0.05). Another study of IBS outpatients showed that one-third reported another family member with IBS, even in patients without a concurrent psychiatric diagnosis. In another study, having a first-degree relative with IBS was one of the characteristics found to be predictive of IBS over other gastrointestinal disorders among outpatients consulting their general practitioner for chronic abdominal pain. The majority of original studies evaluating familial clustering of IBS has been based predominantly on patient report of having another affected family member with IBS—proxy reporting. However, one study by our group has shown that accuracy of patient reporting on a specific relative’s IBS status is poor. As a consequence, a large family case-control study was performed which collected bowel symptom and medical history data directly from cases, controls, and their first-degree relatives. This study of 477 cases, 1492 case-relatives, 297 controls, and 936 control-relatives found that 50% of case- and 27% of control-families had at least one other relative with IBS (p<0.05) (Figure 2). The magnitude of this effect was an odds ratio of 2.75 (95%CI: 2.01–3.76). When looking at the absolute proportion of relatives affected, 25% of case-relatives reported having IBS compared to 12% of control-relatives (p<0.05). Furthermore, the magnitude of familial aggregation did not vary by gender of the proband with males and females being equally likely to have an affected relative or set of relatives. Although confidence intervals overlapped, there was a trend for the strength of aggregation to be greatest among probands with diarrhea, followed by constipation, and then mixed bowel habits. Prior intestinal infections, abuse, and depression or anxiety were more common among cases than controls, and among affected relatives than unaffected relatives. The overall prevalence of these risk factors were 9% of affected relatives reporting a prior infection (v. 5% among controls), 35% reporting abuse (v. 25%), and 44% reporting depression or anxiety (v. 22%). Thus, a family member of an individual with IBS is 2–3 times more likely to have IBS, familial clustering is present irrespective of predominant bowel pattern, and the known environmental risk factors for IBS are also common in IBS families. Study of the pattern of IBS transmission through families has yielded additional interesting observations. A recent study of children with functional gastrointestestinal disorders (FGIDs),—but not IBS exclusively-- their parents, and their child-aged siblings was performed and it showed that all mothers, fathers, and siblings of cases were more likely to be affected with another FGID than matching control-relatives. Mothers were the most likely to have a FGID (49.6% case-mothers v. 21.4% control-mothers, p<0.05), followed by their child-aged siblings (26.4% v. 17.6, N.S.), then fathers (13.6% v. 9.3%, N.S.). In contrast, our study of adult patients with IBS showed that adult-aged case-siblings had the highest risk of concurrent IBS, followed by their adult-aged children, and then parents. Although female relatives were more likely to be affected with IBS, both genders were still at risk for IBS compared to control- relatives. When formal segregation analysis was performed to determine whether the pattern of transmission of IBS through pedigrees is consistent with Mendelian models (e.g. autosomal dominant, recessive, X-linked, etc.), IBS transmission was not consistent with the sporadic model, meaning IBS appeared consistently in families and in parents, arguing against random mutations causing IBS. More importantly, there was general lack of convergence of the data with segregation analysis. This finding suggests that IBS does not result from a single, major locus, that there was incomplete penetrance, or that IBS could be the result of genetic and environmental factors. The findings are indicative of an underlying genetic basis for IBS. Although IBS appears to run in families, the previously cited studies suggest that there may be individuals with “sporadic” or non-familial IBS as well as individuals with a familial form of IBS. This observation begs the question as to whether there are clinical characteristics suggesting a distinct mechanistic basis for the sporadic and familial forms of IBS. Genetic diseases may present at an earlier age or present with a more specific form of disease (e.g. colon cancer). Our study found that cases with a stronger family history of IBS had more severe pain, had concurrent fibromyalgia, heartburn, asthma, and reported symptoms of loose stools, urgency constipation, and pain compared to those with less of a family history of IBS (p<0.05). Age of onset was not predicted by family history of IBS thus demonstrating that patients with a family history did not experience IBS symptom onset at a younger age than patients without a family history of IBS. Although at a univariate level of analysis, somatization level, and personal or family history of psychiatric history or abuse were more common among individuals (probands and relatives) with IBS, these factors were not predictive of familial IBS with univariate or with multivariate analyses, suggesting that familial clustering was not related to psychological or psychiatric disease. Kanazawa, et al. has shown that among IBS patients reporting a parental history of bowel problems, these individuals exhibit higher levels of psychological distress. These studies suggest that familial forms of IBS are characterized by greater pain severity and greater comorbidity including psychological distress. Twin studies also support the concept that IBS may be a complex disorder with genetic as well as environmental contributors. To date, there have been at least five twin studies of IBS or functional bowel disorders that estimate that the genetic liability ranges between 1–20% and heritability estimates ranging between 0–57% (Figure 2). In all but one study, the concordance rates for monozygotic twins (who are genetically identical) were higher than the concordance rates for dizygotic twins, suggesting an underlying genetic etiology. Nonetheless, Mohammed, et al. found that concordance rates for monozygotic and dizygotic twins were similar for IBS using a validated questionnaire and the Rome II diagnostic criteria to make the diagnosis of IBS, thus arguing that genes are not a major factor in IBS development, and certainly not a major gene with a strong effect. Studies with twins reared apart, which would permit greater discernment of the influence of different environments in genetically identical twins, are unfortunately lacking. Heritability (h2) is another statistical estimate to quantitate the relative genetic contribution to a trait, relative to its environmental contributors. Heritability is the amount or proportion of phenotypic variance of the disease of interest in the population that is inherited through genetic factors. The twin studies show that the heritability estimates range from 0% in the British Twin Study, 22% in the Minnesota Twin Study, 48% in the Norwegian Twin Study, to 57% in the Australian Twin study (Figure 3). Using data collected from families and not twin pairs, when the IBS-Rome criteria were converted into a quantitative trait based on number of Rome symptoms endorsed and severity, the heritability estimates for IBS ranged from 0.19–0.35. depending on the weighting factors for each score. In summary, these studies suggest that the genetic contribution to IBS development is reasonably high and comparable to other diseases for which a genetic basis has been found. Environmental factors and familial IBS Despite the consistent observation that IBS clusters in families, this could still be explained by shared environmental contributors, or less likely, individual environmental exposures. Individual environmental contributors that are not likely to be shared among family members or across generations will not be discussed in detail in this review. These exposures include early and later life experiences such as nasogastric tube placement at birth, other painful stimuli experienced during infancy, maternal separation, socioeconomic status, military deployment, and microflora. These individual environmental factors are still important to potentially include when gene-environment interactions may be required for disease development. This section will discuss shared household exposures that could represent an alternative mechanism besides an underlying genetic basis for the familial aggregation observed in the families of patients with IBS. Environmental exposures that could have been shared between multiple family members include verbal abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, shared household stressor/s (e.g. ill family member, unemployment, catastrophe, etc.), parenting style, and learned illness behavior. Verbal, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood has been reported to be more common in patients with IBS than in matched controls in several studies. Up to 50% of patients with IBS may report a history of lifetime victimization. The mechanism by which abuse is associated with, or possibly leads to development of IBS may be the result of psychological factors rather than a fundamental change in gastrointestinal motor and sensory function. Heitkempker et al. has shown that among those with IBS, few differences were observed in characteristics compared between women with and those without an abuse history. Furthermore, when four groups of patients with and without IBS and with and without sexual abuse histories had rectal distension studies performed, although IBS again reported greater sensitivity to rectal distension, sexual abuse did not attenuate results. Ringel, et al. has also recently shown that the presence or absence of abuse does not alter rectal sensation or lead to increased rectal pain sensation. In contrast, a population-based study found that although childhood abuse was associated with IBS, the abuse was no longer associated for IBS when neuroticism was accounted for and included in the analyses. In the only family study examining the role of abuse, our group has shown that in family relatives, the association between abuse and IBS disappeared after inclusion of somatization in the multivariate model. This suggests that either somatization leads to over-reporting of abuse, or perhaps more likely, abuse leads to somatization that ultimately results in IBS symptom development and reporting. Furthermore, as the majority of patients with IBS report no abuse history, abuse is clearly not required for the development of IBS. The familial clustering of IBS is unlikely to be explained by shared household exposure to an abuser, as the prevalence of abuse is the same among familial and non-familial, sporadic IBS. Besides household exposure to abuse, other shared stressors experienced in a family environment, particularly during childhood, could include adverse life events such as loss of a parent or close relative, significant illness in a household relative, singular or recurrent unemployment, and natural disasters. However, adverse childhood events appear very common—approximately 60% of 17,000 adults from an HMO reported one or more events during childhood, and no secular trends were observed across four birth cohorts. Another study specifically comparing the role of early adverse life events among IBS patients and controls with respect to salivary cortisol measurements before and after a visceral stressor found that early adverse life events were present in nearly 50% of both patients with IBS as well as their matched controls, and that IBS was equally common among individuals reporting adverse life events as compared to individuals reporting no early life events. Although cortisol levels were higher among individuals reporting adverse childhood events compared to those without early events, IBS patients did not have different salivary cortisol responses to stress than controls, and there was only a trend for an interaction between IBS patients who had reported life events and higher cortisol levels compared to controls (p=0.056). Furthermore, although adverse life events appear to be common across time and thus, possibly across generations, they are unlikely to be shared across multiple generations making the hypothesis that they could contribute to familial clustering of IBS less viable. Besides childhood or early adulthood exposures and stressors, others have suggested that the familial clustering of IBS may be due to learned illness behavior modeled from parents. Whitehead et al. surveyed a sample of the general population in metropolitan Cincinnati and found that individuals with IBS symptoms exhibited somatic behavior (e.g. reporting more complaints, consulting physicians for minor complaints) but importantly, reported being given gifts or special foods as children during illness—findings not found in those in acute diseases such as peptic ulcer patients and the asymptomatic general population. Another study also confirmed that patients with IBS were more likely to miss school and have more doctor visits as children than individuals without IBS, suggesting that their parents paid greater attention to their illnesses reinforcing chronic illness behaviors. Levy et al. conducted an interview study of mothers with IBS and their children and compared them to mothers without IBS and their children. She found that children of mothers with IBS have more gastrointestinal as well as non-gastrointestinal symptoms and have more school absences and physician visits. The investigators found that mother-IBS status was independent from maternal solicitousness (reinforcement of illness behavior) where parent-IBS status influenced children’s perceptions of symptom severity but not their perception of the seriousness of gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas parental solicitousness appeared to influence the children’s reporting of seriousness of symptoms but not severity. Ultimately, the study supported the role of learned illness behavior, although the authors could not distinguish genetic and environmental contributors to gastrointestinal symptoms. In summary, shared household environmental factors—whether abuse, other early adverse life events, or learned illness behavior from parental modeling—could explain a subset of cases with IBS, but the degree to which they contribute to familial clustering of IBS still remains to be fully elucidated. Genetic diseases that mimic IBS One of the great challenges of studying the genetics of IBS is that there are a number of disorders with symptoms similar to IBS, and a group of these may also have an underlying genetic basis. These diseases include inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis) and celiac sprue. These genetic traits may also co-exist with IBS-- lactose or fructose intolerance, for example—whose presence does not necessarily preclude an IBS diagnosis. As these disorders are not always ruled out prior to inclusion in family studies, there will always be some degree of uncertainty regarding the potential role of these disorders in the familial aggregation of IBS. Despite this concern of another genetic disorder mimicking IBS, we found that in our group of over 500 IBS case that their IBS diagnoses endured over inflammatory conditions after extensive chart review as well as serological testing for celiac sprue. Celiac sprue was found in only 1% of IBS cases and in a comparable proportion of controls. When Villani et al. screened loci associated with Crohn’s disese and ulcerative colitis in this sample, IBD loci were not observed in the IBS group. Similarly, the prevalence of lactase nonpersistance was no different between IBS cases and their controls (15% v. 14%, suggesting that this autosomal recessive trait is unlikely to explain IBS let alone explain the familial aggregation of IBS. Nonetheless, as a mimicker, testing for and adjustment for lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease may be necessary in gene studies of IBS. In addition to gastrointestinal diseases, the genetics of other non-gastrointestinal disorders such as psychiatric diseases and traits may be important to account for in family studies of IBS as psychiatric disorders are common in patients with IBS and select antidepressants can be used to treat IBS. A number of studies have shown that there is a link between IBS and psychiatric illness, including in families. Sullivan, et al. reported that among outpatients receiving their first diagnosis of IBS, the prevalence of depression among blood relatives was higher than in controls (5.7% v. 1.8%, p<0.05), at a level comparable with a group of individuals with major depression (5%). Although the proportion of relatives with depression was higher in IBS patients, the numbers were still quite low, but the authors argue that self-report of family history is less reliable and likely represents an underestimate of the true prevalence of depression. Woodman, et al. conducted interviews of relatives of patients with IBS and patients who had undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and found that the relatives of IBS patients were more likely to report depressive disorders (33.3% v. 17.3%, p=0,05) and anxiety disorders (41.7 v. 18.7, p<0.05), but not somatoform (2.1 v. 1.8%, p>0.05) or substance use disorders (18.8 v. 32.0%, p>0.05). Hudson, et al. performed a similar study interviewing probands with and without major depressive disorder (MDD) and found that IBS was more common in relatives of probands with MDD than in relatives of probands without MDD (16 v. 7%). In short, there has been suggestion that IBS is part of a larger genetic psychiatric disorder. However, some could argue that because psychiatric co-morbidity is related to health-care seeking but not a common feature in community IBS, that it is unlikely that a broader psychiatric trait is the heritable component in IBS. Our large family case-control study did not find that a personal history of psychiatry disease, a family history of psychiatric disease, or a family history of alcohol abuse was predictive of familial IBS. And as discussed in the next section, we did not observe that common genetic variants associated with mood disorders were associated with IBS in the absence of psychiatric disease. Thus, although it is possible there is a genetic variant responsible for a psychiatric trait linked to IBS, there is likely a separate genetic and biological mechanism to explain the remaining symptoms of IBS. Candidate Gene and Pathway Studies To date, nearly 60 genes have been evaluated to determine whether specific genetic variants may be associated with IBS. The genes, the genetic markers, the findings, and references for these studies are summarized on Table 1. The genes studied lay in the following main pathways: serotonin, adrenergic, inflammation, intestinal barrier, and psychiatric. The genes studied were selected because of their proteins’ putative role in gastrointestinal motor or sensory function or because of their potential role in resistance or response to microbial organisms. As gastrointestinal motility and sensation are abnormal in a subset of IBS patients, infection is a risk factor for IBS development, and antibiotic therapy can attenuate IBS symptoms, the genes encoding proteins and peptides related to gastrointestinal function pose an attractive target of study. Because the number of genetic markers and genes is too great to review in entirety, this section will focus primarily on genetic pathways and positive findings reported by investigators. Serotonin has been well studied because of its presence in the intestinal tract and brain. Over 95% of the body’s serotonin is located in intestinal enterochromaffin cells, but this neurotransmitter is best known for its effect on mood. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are one the most effective anti-depressant therapies available. Furthermore, serotonin receptor agonists and antagonists are known to accelerate and slow down gastrointestinal transit and positive impact IBS symptoms. 5-HTT LPR--for serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region)—is the best studied functional variant in the psychiatric and IBS field. Eleven candidate gene association studies and a meta-analysis have been published, largely demonstrating no link between this variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism and IBS and its subtypes. In contrast to the psychiatric literature in which a number of studies suggest gene-environment interactions between this variant and abuse or other stressors, no similar interaction was seen between this variant and environment factors such as abuse, parental psychiatric disease, and gastrointestinal infection. In addition to studies of other genetic variants on the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), several studies have examined functional SNPs on the genes encoding serotonin receptors. These genes that encode various receptor subtypes include: HTR2A, HTR3A, HTR3B, HTR3C, and HTR3E. Three studies had positive findings. One study found that the HTR3A −42C>T C/T genotype was more common in IBS-D patients. Unfortunately, this finding was not replicated in a second cohort. In contrast, the *76G>A SNP on the HTR3E gene was found to be associated with IBS-D in two separate cohorts. This finding is intriguing because the 5-HT3E receptor is expressed in colon, small intestine, and stomach and in vitro studies show that there is increased expression of 5-HT3E subunits and thus may have direct effects on the function of 5-HT3 receptors. Fukudo et al. studied the 386A>C polymorphism on the HTR3B gene and found that regions of brain activation differed between AA subjects and AC and CC subjects. Our group has recently performed a comprehensive study of over 20 serotonin-related genes in 968 cases and controls and have observed the following associations: 1) 27 SNP associations on 9 genes with IBS with several associations on TDO2, HTR2A, and HTR7; 2) 32 SNPs on 15 genes with IBS-C with multiple associations on HTR4 and HTR7; 3) 26 SNPs on 7 genes with IBS-D with multiple associations on HTR2A; and 4) 32 associations on 9 genes with multiple associations on TPH2, DDC, TDO2, HTR1E, HTR2A, and HTR7. Thus, there are several lines of evidence to suggest that genes involved with serotonin processing are important in the pathophysiology of IBS. Genes encoding intestinal barrier proteins have also been studied because of a subgroup of IBS patients whose symptoms began after an acute gastroenteritis, known as post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS). Villani et al. conducted an extensive study utilizing the Walkerton Health Study (WHS), a population cohort created after contamination of a municipal water supply in Walkerton, Canada that resulted in a large outbreak of acute E. Coli 0157:H7 and C. jejeuni gastroenteritis with over 2300 developing acute gastroenteritis. This cohort has undergone clinical assessments as well as intensive surveys to define past and current health and has been followed longitudinally to provide a unique resource to better understand the epidemiological features of PI-IBS. In this study, the investigators selected 79 functional variants in 51 candidate genes that either encoded proteins involved in intestinal epithelial barrier function, innate immune response, the serotonin pathways, as well as other genes postulated by others to be potentially associated with IBS, and tested these variants in 228 cases with PI-IBS and 581 controls. Four of the SNPs were associated with PI-IBS. Two variants were on the TLR9 gene encoding the toll-like receptor 9; one was on CDH1 gene encoding the tight junction protein, cadherin; and one variant was on IL6 which encodes the cytokine, interleukin-6. Fine-mapping was then performed with selection of additional SNPs in these 3 genomic regions including functional SNPs associated with inflammatory conditions, non-synonymous SNPs reported in dbSNP with minor allele frequencies >1%, SNPs disrupting transcription-factor, microRNA or enhancer binding sites, SNPs located in regulator regions, and tagging SNPs to cover the remaining regions of the three genes (defined as 10kb upstream and 10kb downstream of coding sequence). When multiple logistic regression to identify risk factors for PI-IBS was performed again, now including the 3 candidate polymorphisms from TLR9, IL6, and CDHI, the original risk factors (e.g. younger age, female gender, etc.) as well as these three genetic variants were found to be independent risk factors for development of PI-IBS. These findings appear to be specific to PI-IBS, because when the genetic variants were re-tested in a separate cohort of non-PI-IBS cases and controls, these findings were not reproduced. In addition to the genes cited above, other genes in the inflammation pathway have been studied because of reports of cytokine abnormalities in patients with IBS. IL10 is the gene that has been studied by three groups. Gonssalkorale et al. tested one SNP −1082G>A and found that IBS patients were less likely to have the high producer genotype. Van der Veek and colleagues subsequently observed no association between the same SNP and IBS, as well as no association between the −819C>T SNP and IBS. Villani et al. noted an association between two SNPs on IL10 with non-infectious IBS (−592A>C, −1082G>A). With further fine-mapping, 16 SNPs on the IL10 gene were genotyped and five additional SNPs were found to be associated with non-infectious IBS. Three of the five new associations could be explained by linkage disequilibrium with the two original variants, but two variants were still associated with non-infectious IBS suggesting that genetic variation in the IL10 promoter region may lead to IBS susceptibility. Nonetheless, the inconsistency in findings between study populations, particularly over the −1082G>A polymorphism, suggests that additional confirmatory work on the IL10 gene and cytokine is needed. Because depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders have been reported to occur in up to 94% of IBS patients, our group was interested in evaluating the relationship between functional SNPs that have been consistently associated with psychiatric disorders and clinical traits such as mood disorders and pain sensitivity. To this end, ten SNPs on eight genes (FKBP5, COMT, NPY, BDNF, ANKK1, DRD2, OPRM1, FAAH) were evaluated. None of the ten tested SNPs were observed to be associated with IBS overall. However, the COMT Val158Met variant was associated with IBS-C (OR=1.81, 95% CI: 1.01–3.25), the OPRM1 118A>G variant was associated with IBS-M (OR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.06–2.30) and IBS-D in females (OR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.00–2.85), and the BDNF Val166Met SNP was associated in IBS individuals with a psychiatric disorder. These findings are of interest as the COMT variant has been linked to anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and cognitive performance while the OPRM1 variant has been linked to pain sensitivity, opioid dependence, and social sensitivity. The BDNF variant has also been linked to emotional reactivity and post-traumatic stress disorder, mood disorders, and schizophrenia. In conclusion, genes HTR2A, HTR3E, IL10, IL6 and other genes are intriguing potential candidate genes for IBS (Figure 4). Furthermore, distinct genes—IL6, CDH1, and TLR9—may represent susceptibility loci for post-infectious IBS, with genetic studies suggesting that there is a different genetic basis for sporadic, non-infectious IBS and post-infectious IBS. But clearly, the role of these genetic variants in IBS development still bears further replication in other patient cohorts, as well as confirmation through additional clinical and laboratory testing. Endophenotypes in IBS Clinical disease can be the result of an aberrant single physiological pathway, but can also be the result of multiple abnormalities in several biological pathways. In the latter case, understanding and discovering the individual pathophysiological mechanisms that result in disease presentation can be difficult, and can be even more difficult if the disease has heterogeneous clinical features that vary from individual to individual. The term, “endophenotype” originated in the psychiatric literature with the idea that an objective, measurable, and ideally reproducible phenotype of a more abstract or complex clinical phenotype would be more closely related to an underlying biological process. Use of endophenotypes in research implies that the complex biological processes causing disease are more easily discoverable if study of the disease can be parsed out into individual, smaller components. Endophenotypes may be a biomarker, or may be referred to as an intermediate phenotype or subclinical trait. In genetics research, endophenotypes should generally have the following characteristics: be associated with illness in the general population, be heritable, co-segregate with illness in families, manifest in an individual irrespective of whether the disease is active or inactive, and be found in affected and unaffected family members of an individual with disease at a higher rate than in the general population. Because of the lack of objective findings and the clinical heterogeneity of functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS, use of an endophenotype strategy in gene discovery for IBS has appeal. Although none have yet been validated as endophenotypes using the Gottesman criteria, at least two testing modalities have been proposed to be potential endophenotypes for IBS: gastrointestinal transit as well as brain imaging with visceral stimulation (Table 2). Gastrointestinal transit as an intermediate phenotype has been studied extensively by Camilleri and colleagues. This group first postulated that because adrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms modulate gastrointestinal motility, an exploratory study was performed examining these four functional variants-- ADRA2A −1291C>G, ADRC2A Del 332–325, GNB3 825C>T, and 5-HTT LPR-- in 251 patients with FGIDs and healthy volunteers. No direct correlation was seen between these 4 genotypes and upper and lower gastrointestinal emptying and transit time, but when interactions between phenotype (e.g. IBS subtype) and genotype were evaluated, several specific interactions were observed. The GNβ3 CC genotype appeared to be predictive of faster gastric emptying among IBS-D patients, the ADRA2A CC genotype was predictive of faster gastric emptying among IBS-M patients, and the ADRA2C heterozygous genotype was associated with slower gastric emptying among IBS-M patient but faster gastric emptying among IBS-C patients. In a subsequent study, in addition to reporting associations with IBS phenotypes (also summarized in Table 1), this group studied the role of the same four genetic markers and rectal compliance and pain sensation and found an association between 5-HTTLPR LS/SS and increased pain sensation and rectal compliance. Besides these genetic markers, this group evaluated the role of FAAH 385C>A in a group of 482 individuals with FGIDs (predominantly IBS patients) with the underlying hypothesis that because cannabinoid receptors are located on brain stem, gastric, and colonic neurons, functional variants that affect endocannabinoid metabolism could affect gastrointestinal motility and/or sensation, and therefore potentially explain IBS-type symptoms. They did find that the A allele was associated with IBS-D and IBS-M (p<0.05) as well as accelerated transit in patients with IBS-D. In another study, Camilleri et al. proposed that 20 SNPs on the NPSR1 gene, which encodes a receptor for neuropeptide S which is localized in gut enteroendocrine cells, could potentially play a role in modulated gastrointestinal motor function and found that four SNPs were associated with colon transit time, with significance that persisted after false detection rate correction for multiple tests. The above studies suggest that the genetic mechanisms for gastrointestinal transit may be specific to IBS subtype. In addition to the previous studies evaluating a mixed group of IBS patients with subanalysis of IBS subtypes, other studies have looked at isolated subgroups. One study of IBS-C patients and seven variants in genes encoding cholecystokinin (CCK), CCKA receptors (CCKAR), and CCKB receptors (CCKBR) found that the intronic 779C>T polymorphism appeared to be associated with delayed gastric emptying in IBS-C patients, but not associated with small intestinal or colonic transit. A more recent study evaluated variations in genes controlling bile acid absorption, processing, and metabolism with colon transit in a clinical trial evaluating the effects of sodium chenodeoxycholate (CDC) on colon transit and symptoms in patients with IBS-C. Sixteen non-synonymous SNPs on 7 genes (NROB2, SC10A2, KLB, FGFR4, OSTα, OSTβ, CYP7A1) were genotyped and analyzed to determine whether they predicted colon transit time in 36 patient with IBS-C. One SNP on the FGFR4 gene was found to be associated with filling of the ascending colon (p=0.015) and borderline associations between a SNP on the CYP7A1 gene and colon transit (p=0.08). The same investigator has also reported an association between rs17618244 on the KLB gene and colon transit time in healthy volunteers as well as those with all IBS subtypes. Fewer studies have been published regarding the role that genetic variants play in modulating brain activation and processing of visceral stimuli. The only paper published as a full manuscript is a study from Fukudo et al. evaluating the role of the 5-HTT LPR polymorphism in brain processing of rectal stimuli by rectal barostat. The investigators postulated that since serotonin neurons in the brain are important in mood as well as anxiety-related behaviors, that 5-HTT LPR could potentially predict activation of prefrontal-limbic circuits. Specifically, they hypothesized that the s allele (resulting in lower transcription of the serotonin transporter, leading to greater synaptic quantities of serotonin) could lead to greater activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala. The investigators found that individuals (not IBS patients) with the s/s genotype were more likely to activate left ACC, right parahippocampal gyrus, and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging than those bearing the l allele. Since these regions are important in central emotional processing, these findings suggest that this variant may also be relevant in brain activation after colorectal distension in patients with IBS. Labus, et al. reported similar findings—that the s/s genotype appears to result in altered activation of brain regions regulating emotional arousal. In contrast to l carriers who exhibited the expected negative connectivity between the sACC and the amygdala, s/s carriers lacked the feedback inhibition of the amygdala, which they postulated could result in magnified perception of visceral sensation and thus, represent a “vulnerability factor” for IBS. The findings from these two studies suggest the 5-HTT LPR, although not a risk factor for the clinical IBS phenotype, could represent a susceptibility factor for components of IBS such as central processing of visceral events. In addition to studies of the much-studied 5-HTT LPR variant, two additional variants have been studied in the context of brain processing. Fukudo, et al. subsequently genotyped the rs1176744 polymorphism on the gene encoding the 5-HT3B receptor (HTR3B) using similar methodology as the previous study and found that those with the AC or CC genotype demonstrated more activation of the right amygdala, left insula, and left OFC—regions controlling negative emotion-- than AA subjects. Truong, et al. used a different strategy to evaluate amygdala-based responses by measuring acoustic startle response by threats (fear potentiation [FP]) and prepulse inhibition [PPI] in relation to the COMT gene, which encodes the catechol O-methyltransferase enzyme, and important regulator of synaptic dopamine levels. This group found that there was an interaction between genotype, diagnosis (IBS, fibromyalgia, controls) and threat condition where Met carriers in patients showed enhanced fear potentiation when faced with imminent threat. The authors speculate that reduced synaptic dopamine in these individuals impair downregulation of amygdala-based startle responses that may lead to hypervigilance to symptoms.",6466
27417569,"Introduction The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are inflammatory disorders primarily affecting the gut.1 The incidence is increasing worldwide and IBD may affect up to 1% of the population.2 Both CD and UC have a major impact on the quality of life of the patients and their families due to debilitating symptoms and also for the society due to absence from work and health care expenses. IBD is considered to develop as a result of a persistent perturbation of the interaction between the gut microbiota and the host immune system resulting in changes in the microbiome (dysbiosis) and in mucosal inflammation.3 Stimulation of toll‐like receptors and nod‐like receptors on epithelial cells and local immune cells by microbes induce various pathways that mediate the secretion of the pro‐inflammatory cytokines interleukine (IL)‐17, IL‐6, interferon‐γ, and tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF)4, 5, 6, 7, 8 resulting in disruption of the barrier function (mainly in UC), dysfunction of microbe sensing (mainly in CD), and changes in the regulation of adaptive immune responses (in both disorders).8 The biological activity of TNF is mediated by its binding to TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1) and type 2 (TNFR2). After binding to the receptors, TNF initiates cell proliferation, differentiation and pro‐inflammatory signalling [via activation of the nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) and mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways].9 Additionally, TNF signalling induces apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells as well as inducing changes in the epithelial expression of tight junction proteins (via caspase‐8 activation).9 Hence, increased TNF‐α expression might decrease the mucosal barrier function.9  Biologics are bioengineered therapeutic agents targeting a gene or a protein. The management of IBD has changed significantly during the last decade due to the availability of anti‐TNF.10, 11 They act through targeting and neutralising the effect of TNF thereby diminishing the downstream effects of TNF activation. However, the pharmacodynamics of anti‐TNF drugs seems to depend on other factors than simply the TNF‐binding capacities.9 Hence, their precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Anti‐TNF drugs have proven highly effective for many patients, yet, a significant proportion of the patients do not respond to the treatment (i.e., ‘primary failures’) due to e.g. genetics or loss of effect over time to become intolerant due to the development of antibodies to the treatment (i.e., ‘secondary failures’).9, 10, 11  Currently, much effort has been put into developing biologics targeting various players in the immune cascade which are involved in IBD,4 including cytokines, cytokine receptors, B‐ and T‐cell surface proteins, cell adhesion molecules, and signal transduction pathways.12 Various immune players may be driving the disease in various patients and the detection of which are the most prominent in the individual patient will be necessary for selecting the best treatment strategy. Until now, the strategy for testing these new biologics in clinical settings used to be ‘one drug suits all’, although they may be beneficial in only a subset of patients characterised by a specific target. Thereby, theoretically, the effect of biologics on a specific subset of the patients may not be detected. ‘Personalised Medicine refers to a medical model using characterisation of individual's phenotypes and genotypes (e.g. molecular profiling, medical imaging, lifestyle data) for tailoring the right therapeutic strategy for the right person at the right time, and/or to determine the predisposition to disease and/or to deliver timely and targeted prevention’.13 According to the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA), European Union, ‘Personalised Medicine represents one of the most innovative new concepts in health care. It holds real promise for more effective early diagnosis and more effective and less toxic treatments for patients, for improved medical service to citizens, and for improving the overall health of the population’.13  Recently, interest in exploring the potentials of personalised medicine in IBD has raised.14, 15, 16 Accordingly, clinical factors associated with anti‐TNF response in CD has been reviewed.15, 17 In CD, young age, short disease duration, and luminal disease were associated with beneficial response and smoking was associated with nonresponse.17 Pre‐treatment C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels and serological markers may also have predictive value.17 The knowledge on factors associated with TNF response in UC are even more scarce.18  Pharmacogenetic studies may help identifying patients likely to benefit from a given treatment and the actual pathways by which a drug works.19, 20 Furthermore, the identification of genetic profiles characterising the nonresponders may lead to understanding of the mechanisms that are active in the nonresponders and may suggest target(s) for treatment strategies in these patients. In pharmacogenetic studies in general, polymorphisms in both the pharmacodynamic (the ‘action’ of the drug) as well as in the pharmacokinetic (the ‘fate’ of the drug) pathways may be relevant in predicting the outcome of the treatment. Genetic variants have already found their way into clinical practice for treatment selection of e.g. hepatitis and colorectal cancer.21, 22 Thus, genetic variants enabling the prediction of anti‐TNF treatment response may help optimising treatment of the individual patients, improve the use of the health care resources and reduce adverse side‐effects. In order to drive the development of personalised medicine in IBD, we conducted a systemic review of the current knowledge on genetic variants associated with anti‐TNF treatment response in patients with IBD. Our aim was to identify potential candidates for further evaluation and putative predictive biomarkers should subsequently be evaluated, validated and eventually adopted for clinical use. Thus, this review deals with primary response which should be distinguish from secondary loss of response, i.e. the situation when a patient loses response after initial response. Results Table 1 summarises the details of the retrieved studies. No published genome‐wide association study on anti‐TNF response in IBD including more than 100 treated cases was identified. In total, 15 studies were included in the analysis. All 15 studies were case–case studies employing a candidate gene design.25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 Fifteen studies reported associations between polymorphisms and treatment response in CD26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and one article reported, in addition to the CD study also a study on UC patients.25 The studies differed according to the studied population, response criteria, and elapsed time before evaluation of response (Table 1). The polymorphisms investigated in relation to the outcome from anti‐TNF treatment of patients with CD and UC are shown in Table 2. The OR and 95% CI for the associations between the polymorphisms and the treatment responses for the polymorphisms that were assessed in more than one cohort were retrieved (Clinical response criteria in Table 3 and biological response criteria in Table 4). In total, 23 polymorphisms in 18 genes were assessed in more than one cohort. The FCGR3A rs396991 polymorphism has been most intensely investigated29, 34, 35, 37 (Tables 3 and 4). This polymorphism has been evaluated both in relation to clinical and biological response criteria.29, 34, 35, 37 First, Louis et al. studied biological response rate from anti‐TNF treatment among 145 patients for whom the CRP level prior to treatment were elevated compare to standard levels.29 Complete biological response was defined as a normalisation of CRP levels and partial response as a decrease of at least 25% from the basal level. A complete or partial biological response was observed in 100% of 29 TT carriers compared to 70% of 71 GG or TG carriers (P = 0.0002). In contrast, no significantly different response rates between the genotypes were found when using clinical response criteria.29 Similarly, results were reported from the ACCENT study.34 Again, no differences were found in relation to clinical criteria. However, analyses of the subgroup with baseline CRP values within the two highest quartiles (N = 156) showed a trend towards a greater relative change in CRP in the TT carriers [the median decrease of CRP were 80, 77 and 64% among TT, TG and GG genotype carriers (P = 0.085) after 6 weeks, respectively]. The authors also observed the same trend at week 2.34 Similar results were found in another study by Moroi et al., who found a significantly larger decrease of CRP (ΔCRP) and percentage decrease (ΔCRP%) among 12 TT genotype carriers than among 38 TG and 52 GG genotype carriers (P = 0.001 and P = 0.044, respectively) at week 8 whereas no differences were found at week 30 and no differences were found in relation to the clinical response criteria.35 FCGR3A encodes a receptor for immunoglobulin G (IgG), FcγRIIIa. Moroi et al. moreover conducted an in vitro experiment, assessing the binding affinity of infliximab to natural killer (NK) cells and the infliximab‐mediated antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) from six healthy volunteers of each genotype.35 The authors reported that NK cells from FCGR3A rs396991 TT donors had significantly higher binding affinity to infliximab compared to donors with the GG genotype (P < 0.05). In addition PMBCs from FCGR3A rs396991 TT donors induced significantly higher infliximab‐mediated antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity, than cells from the GG donors (P < 0.05).35 Subsequently, Koder et al. reported no significant association between anti‐TNF response and either clinical or biological response.37 Clinical response was based on an IBDQ and defined as an IBDQ value higher than 170 points or an increase in IBDQ of more than 22 points (ΔIBDQ >22).40  Figures 2 and S1 show the results of the meta‐analyses including the retrievable data for all polymorphisms studied in at least two studies. In total, eight polymorphisms in seven genes were found to be significantly associated with treatment response (Figure 2). All eight polymorphisms were identified in one study including both a CD and an UC cohort.25 The genes were TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, TNFRSF1A, IFNG, IL6 and IL1B. Furthermore, nine polymorphisms in eight genes (TLR2, CD14, LY96, TNF, TNFRSF1B, TNFAIP3, IL1RN and IL17A) were not associated with treatment result (Figure S1). In addition, three polymorphisms in NOD2 and a marker polymorphism near IL10 were not associated with treatment response in more than one individual study (Table 3). The predictive potential of five polymorphisms was estimated based on original data supplied by Bank et al.25 (Figure 3 and Table 5). We first used logistic regression to identify five genotypes (2 in TLR2, 2 in IL12B, and 1 in IL6) that were significantly associated with an increased risk of anti‐TNF nonresponse. As simple binary predictors they were only modestly associated with nonresponse (OR < 2, results not shown). These five genotypes were then combined into a sum score. The overall nonresponse rate was 23.4% for the UC cases. OR of nonresponse dependent on the sum score of the five selected genotypes is shown in Figure 3. Patients who were carriers of all five genotypes had an OR of 25 (95% CI: 1.93–323.55) for nonresponse (Figure 3). Positive and negative predictive values for the sum scores are shown in Table 5. No variations or combination of variations could produce negative predictive values above 0.5 (ranging from 0.0 to 0.5). The positive predictive values, however, were very high for some genetic profiles. In particular, the group of 26 patients (corresponding to 11% of the UC patients) without any of the five low‐response associated genotypes had a positive predictive value of 0.96.",1858
25045210,"1. Introduction Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Its two major forms are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Crohn's disease affects mainly small intestine and colon, although any other segment of the GI tract may also be involved. CD is characterized by discontinuous ulcerations and bowel wall inflammation. UC manifests by inflammation of the colon mucosa that in most cases extends to the rectum. Typical symptoms of IBD are abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and rectal bleeding as well as weight loss, fever, and fatigue. Furthermore, CD patients often develop strictures between segments of the bowel or between the bowel and other organs. IBD is an autoimmune disorder of unknown aetiology that results from excessive immune responses to intestinal microbiota which are triggered by increased activity of effector T cells and/or decreased activity of regulatory T cells, changes in the composition of intestinal microflora, and/or damaged epithelial barrier. Recently, Hand et al. showed in a mouse model that acute infection of the GI tract results in the loss of CD4(+) T cell tolerance of commensal antigens and priming of adaptive immune response directed against commensal bacteria which contributes to the development of IBD. Furthermore, 5–16% of IBD patients report a family history of the disease which indicates that it may be associated also with a genetic background. Indeed, there are several genetic factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of the IBD which include genetic mutations leading to enhanced inflammatory response, defective elimination of intracellular bacteria, or disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier. There are also certain environmental risk factors for IBD that include (1) treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which damage intestinal mucosa, making it more permeable to bacteria; (2) taking oral contraceptives that elevate the level of estrogens which act as enhancers of humoral immunity; (3) smoking that increases risk of acquiring CD, although it appears to play a protective role in UC through yet unknown mechanisms; and (4) limitation of exposure to enteric pathogens in childhood due to antibiotic treatment or living in hygienic environment. Association of IBD with other environmental factors such as diet rich in sugars and fats and living in urban environment or stress remains currently controversial. Considering the type of immune response, IBD is not a uniform disease; in CD the inflammation is mainly driven by T helper 1 (Th1) or T helper 17 (Th17) cells, while UC is considered to be generally a T helper 2- (Th2-) mediated condition. It has to be noted, however, that the strict polarization model of Th1, Th2, and Th17 is not fully applicable in IBD due to a redundancy of effector and regulatory pathways affected by factors such as the phase of the disease (remission or acute bouts), innate inflammatory mechanisms, or anti-inflammatory treatment of patients. For example, during the remission phase of the disease, the level of a Th2 cytokine, interleukin 13 (IL-13), is higher in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients with CD than in PBMCs isolated from patients with UC. Other reports show that the frequency of Th1 (IFN-γ(+) CD4(+)) T cells is lower in the peripheral blood of paediatric IBD patients than in healthy control subjects and it increases with patients' age. Furthermore, the cytokine expression profile in IBD patients does not usually reflect fully differentiated Th1, Th2, or Th17 immune responses. In UC, expression of a typical Th2 cytokine, IL-4, was not elevated in intestinal mucosa of UC patients. Instead, it has been suggested that the central role in the pathogenesis of UC is played by IL-13 which not only acts as a Th2 effector cytokine but also disrupts the continuity of colonic epithelium by inducing apoptosis of epithelial cells and upregulating expression of claudin-2, a pore-forming tight junction protein. To add more complexity to the pathogenesis of IBD, a recent report by Mannon et al. has showed that in some patients UC is characterized by elevated production of a Th17-specific cytokine, IL-17A, by intestinal lamina propria T cells. 2. Tumour Necrosis Factor Superfamily  There are 19 ligands and 29 receptors identified to date that constitute the tumour necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF). Their expression pattern and structural attributes allow them to activate signalling pathways that lead to cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. TNFSF receptors can be divided into two groups depending on the presence or absence of the intracellular death domain (DD). Signalling via the death domain requires the participation of adaptor proteins FADD (Fas-associated death domain) and TRADD (TNF receptor-associated death domain) and leads to activation of caspases which typically results in apoptotic death of a cell. The second group of TNFSF receptors signals only via adaptor proteins termed TRAFs (tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated proteins), although DD-containing receptors can also utilize this pathway. TRAFs bind either to TRADD or directly to the cytoplasmic part of the receptor and initiate signal transduction pathways that lead to the activation of several transcription factors, such as AP-1 and NF-κB, responsible for the activation of prosurvival genes, although they are involved also in proapoptotic signalling. Hence, functional activity of TNFSF receptors largely depends on the cellular context and the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic factors inside the cell and in the environment. Most TNFSF members are expressed on cells of the immune system and play an important role in maintaining the equilibrium of T cell-mediated immune responses by providing direct signals required for full activation of effector and regulatory T cells, regulation of their expansion, contraction of the T cell effector pool, and survival of memory T cells. For these reasons, members of the TNFSF are involved in the pathogenesis of many T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, such as asthma, diabetes, or arthritis. Many recent reports indicate that certain TNFSF members, notably, TNF (tumour necrosis factor, TNFSF2, also known as TNF-α), TL1A (TNF-like protein 1A, TNFSF15), FasL (TNFSF6), LIGHT (lymphotoxin-like inducible protein that competes with glycoprotein D for binding herpesvirus entry mediator on T cell, TNFSF14), TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand, TNFSF10), and TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis, TNFSF12), contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD not only by enhancing proinflammatory function of T cells but also by direct disruption of the integrity of intestinal epithelium (Table 1). 3. TNF  Tumour necrosis factor (TNF; TNF-α; TNFSF2) is biologically active in the form of homotrimeric transmembrane or soluble protein. It is expressed by macrophages, T cells, B cells, NK cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and neurons; its expression is strongly upregulated by certain proinflammatory factors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other bacterial products and IL-1β. There are two types of TNF receptors, the death domain-containing TNFR1 (TNF receptor 1, also known as p55 or TNFRSF1A), which is constitutively expressed on most nucleated mammalian cells and is activated by both the transmembrane and soluble form of TNF, and TNFR2 (TNF receptor 2, also known as p75 or TNFRSF1B) which does not contain the death domain and is activated only by the transmembrane form of TNF. Expression of TNFR2 is strictly regulated and found mostly on certain populations of lymphocytes, including T-regulatory cells (Tregs), endothelial cells, microglia, neuron subtypes, oligodendrocytes, cardiac myocytes, thymocytes, and human mesenchymal stem cells. Elevated expression of TNF was detected in IBD patients more than 20 years ago. The level of TNF mRNA was upregulated in involved colonic tissue of CD patients as well as in both involved and uninvolved colonic tissue of UC patients compared to healthy subjects. A recent report showed that elevated concentration of TNF protein that correlated with the activity of the disease was present in blood serum of CD patients while other groups found increased levels of TNF protein both in serum and in the intestinal lamina propria of both CD and UC patients as well as the intestinal submucosa of CD patients. The production of TNF in the colon mucosa of UC patients was localized to lamina propria macrophages. Although several groups did not detect increased levels of TNF protein or mRNA in blood serum or colon mucosa of IBD patients, respectively, successful use of anti-TNF agents in IBD therapy documents that TNF belongs to the major effector molecules involved in the pathogenesis of CD and UC. It is worth to note, however, that a recent study on a mouse model of T cell-mediated colitis has shown that only neutralization of the transmembrane, but not soluble, TNF form induced remission of experimental colitis. Pathogenesis of IBD is associated also with altered expression of TNF receptors since both CD and UC patients showed elevated expression of TNFR2 on colonic epithelial cells. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between CD and UC activity and serum concentration of soluble forms of TNFR1 and TNFR2. Furthermore, upregulated expression of TNFR2 (but not TNFR1) was found on intestinal lamina propria CD4+ cells as well as peripheral blood T cells of CD patients. 3.1. Role of TNF in the Dysregulation of Intestinal Barrier Permeability Several studies showed that TNF contributes to the disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier which allows for intestinal penetration of luminal antigens and promotes intestinal inflammation (Table 2). Intestinal epithelium integrity is provided by the presence of tight junctions (TJ) located in the apical region of intestinal epithelial cells. Data obtained in vitro by Ma et al. showed that stimulation of colonic epithelial Caco-2 cells with TNF downregulated the expression of TJ-associated zonula occludens-1 proteins and altered their junctional localization in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Transmembrane expression of TNF is regulated by a pleiotropic metalloproteinase ADAM17 which is involved in the cleavage of transmembrane TNF and its shedding from the cell surface. Cesaro et al. reported early posttranscriptional upregulation of ADAM17 in intestinal mucosa of patients with highly active CD and, in an in vitro model, in intestinal epithelial cells, which was linked to transepithelial migration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Treatment of TIMP3-deficient colonic epithelial cell line HT29-C1.16E with TIMP3, an inhibitor of ADAM17 activity, decreased TNF shedding and sensitized the cells to TNF-mediated epithelial hyperpermeability due to the downregulation of zonula occludens-1 proteins. Other reports showed that IBD patients had also elevated mucosal expression of another TNF sheddase, metalloprotease ADAM19, localized mainly in epithelial cells, whereas a mouse study demonstrated that shedding of TNF can be mediated also by matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13). Epithelial barrier dysfunction can be mediated also by increased expression of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) followed by subsequent phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) which results in the contraction of the perijunctional ring composed of actin and myosin filaments. Expression of MLCK was elevated in ileal and colonic epithelium of CD and UC patients and correlated with the activity of the disease. In vitro investigation showed that TNF upregulated expression of MLCK in Caco-2 cells pretreated with IFN-γ which increased expression of TNF receptors on the cell surface. A recent study on TNFR1 or TNFR2-deficient mice showed that upregulation of MLCK and the loss of intestinal epithelial barrier in CD4(+) CD45RB (high) T cell transfer model of intestinal inflammation were dependent on TNFR2 expressed on intestinal epithelium but not TNFR1. In an elegant in vivo study on mouse models, Marchiando et al. showed that TNF induced redistribution of several TJ and adherens junction proteins, including zonula occludens-1, occludins, claudins, and E-cadherin, as well as MCLK, to basolateral membranes of intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, administration of TNF resulted not only in the rearrangement of junctional proteins but also in the shedding of whole cells from intestinal epithelium. These events were preceded by caspase-3 activation due to the TNF-induced activation of NF-κB-dependent signalling pathway and of proapoptotic pathways. These data suggest that TNF-triggered loss of intestinal epithelium integrity is a complex process which involves not only rearrangement of cytoskeletal elements but also direct induction of intestinal cells' apoptosis by TNF. Indeed, studies on mice showed TNF-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in a TNFR1- and TNFR2-dependent manner which resulted in increased intestinal permeability in vivo. TNF signalling upregulated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) which led to enhanced expression of a proapoptotic protein p53. On the other hand, TNF participates also in transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which signaling upregulates the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Increased expression of COX-2 has been associated with enhanced cell resistance to apoptosis, inflammation, and promotion of tumour progression; therefore this aspect of TNF activity might have relevance to development of IBD-associated cancers of the GI tract. 3.2. Anti-TNF Agents in IBD Therapy Currently, IBD therapy based on blocking biological activity of TNF involves the use of the following anti-TNF agents approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA): (1) infliximab: chimeric monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (approved by FDA and EMA for treatment of CD and UC); (2) adalimumab: human monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (approved by FDA for treatment of CD in adults and by EMA for treatment of CD and UC); (3) certolizumab pegol: humanized Fab' fragment of anti-TNF antibody conjugated to polyethylene glycol (approved by FDA only for treatment of CD); (4) golimumab: human monoclonal anti-TNF antibody (approved by FDA and EMA for treatment of UC). Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol are effective in the treatment of patients with moderate and severe CD who do not respond to standard anti-inflammatory drugs and also when used as a first-line therapy in CD. Moreover, randomised, controlled trials showed also that infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab induced remission in steroid- or immunosuppressant-refractory patients with moderate or severe UC. However, 10 to 40% of CD patients (depending on selection criteria) and up to 50% of UC patients do not respond to anti-TNF therapy (primary resistance) and about one-third become resistant (secondary loss of response) at 12 months after initiation of anti-TNF treatment. Interestingly, switching to another anti-TNF agent is effective in over 50% of nonresponsive patients. Failure to respond to anti-TNF therapy may result from pharmacokinetics of drugs, development of antibodies against the drugs, or activity of other, TNF-independent, proinflammatory pathways in IBD patients. It has also to be noted that blockade of TNF biological activity in IBD therapy may result in several adverse side effects, including acute or delayed hypersensitivity reactions to anti-TNF agents, elevated risk of bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, and fungal infections (although meta-analysis of clinical trials did not show increased rate of infections in the course of anti-TNF treatment), or neurological complications. Combinatory therapy of CD patients with glucocorticoids, immunomodulators, and TNF inhibitors may be associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lung, skin, and other types of cancers, although no causative relationship of anti-TNF antibodies and carcinogenesis has been proven. Anti-TNF therapy may lead also to paradoxical inflammatory skin (eczema and psoriasis) and joint (polyarthralgia) or ocular (uveitis and scleritis) manifestations. Other paradoxical reactions include also demyelinating central nervous system disorders, sarcoidosis, development of anti-nuclear antibodies, and, in rare cases, lupus. Mechanisms leading to these paradoxical reactions are not currently well known and most probably involve multiple pathogenic pathways. For example, it has been recently reported that psoriasiform skin lesions characterised by Th17 and Th1 cell infiltrates developed in nearly 5% of anti-TNF-treated patients with IBD and that smoking was identified as a main risk factor. Interestingly, anti-IL-12/IL-23 antibody treatment was found to be a highly effective therapy for these lesions. Despite high efficacy of the majority of anti-TNF antibodies in the therapy of a considerable proportion of both CD and UC patients, the precise mechanisms of action underlying the efficacy of anti-TNF agents in IBD therapy have not been fully explained. In the last decade multiple mechanisms of the anti-TNF antibodies such as blocking and neutralizing of TNF molecules, regulation of cell adhesion molecule expression, induction of regulatory macrophages, or direct induction of apoptosis of T lymphocytes and macrophages in the mucosal lamina propria and peripheral blood have been proposed. However, the results of newer studies suggest that increased apoptosis of Treg cells, an important subset of T lymphocytes, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD and can be reversed by anti-TNFα treatment. Moreover, infliximab and adalimumab (but not etanercept and certolizumab) were shown to induce regulatory macrophages (CD206+) in an Fc region-dependent manner. In vitro these macrophages produced anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibited proliferation of activated T cells, whereas in vivo a significant induction of regulatory macrophages was observed in IBD patients with mucosal healing after treatment with infliximab and this induction was absent in patients without mucosal healing response. Recently, Leal et al. using whole-genome transcriptional analysis have found that anti-TNF treatment reduced expression of a set of proinflammatory genes (including IL-6, IL-23p19, and MMP9) as well as genes of cell-activation markers (CD69, CD83, and VCAM-1) in patients who both did and did not respond to this kind of therapy, suggesting that it is not only the proinflammatory function of TNF that is targeted by anti-TNF therapy. Moreover, they identified IL1B and IL17A as genes that remained altered in nonresponders, which suggests that respective proteins or their signaling pathways may present a novel therapeutic target in IBD. Since many studies have linked TNF to increased permeability of intestinal epithelium, it is highly possible that anti-TNF agents are involved in the protection of epithelial barrier. Indeed, administration of infliximab restored the proper function of intestinal epithelium in CD patients and prevented TNF-induced rearrangement of tight junction proteins (notably, occludin and zonula occludens-1) in dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid- (DNBS-) induced colitis in mice. These findings have been supported by a recent in vitro study on intestinal epithelial cell lines Caco-2 and T84 which showed that adalimumab restored expression of tight junction proteins claudin-1, claudin-2, and claudin-3 downregulated by exposure to TNF and IFN-γ. Other studies demonstrated that infliximab and adalimumab induced apoptosis of CD4(+) helper T cells expressing TNFR2 and macrophages isolated from colonic lamina propria of CD patients but not healthy subjects. Furthermore, Eder et al. found that infliximab and adalimumab promoted apoptosis of intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells present in inflamed but not noninflamed areas of CD patients' colonic mucosa via intrinsic pathway mediated by Bcl-2 family proteins. Thus, infliximab and adalimumab not only protect intestinal epithelial integrity but also may suppress inflammatory process by inducing apoptosis of immune cells present in intestinal mucosa. The ongoing research aimed at the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory activity of some but not all anti-TNF antibodies in IBD should help in designing more target-effective biological drugs. Etanercept, a nonantibody soluble fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of TNFR2 and the hinge and Fc fragments of human IgG1 antibody, is an anti-TNF agent approved by FDA and EMA for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis but not IBD. Even though experiments on mice with DNB-induced colitis showed that etanercept reduced levels of circulating TNF and prevented apoptosis of enterocytes equally well as infliximab, studies on humans proved that response rates to etanercept in CD treatment were comparable to placebo. A study by Scallon et al. showed that infliximab binds both monomeric and trimeric forms of soluble and transmembrane TNF, whereas etanercept forms only unstable complexes with soluble TNF which may contribute to prolonged half-life of circulating TNF. Furthermore, in contrast to infliximab, etanercept did not induce apoptosis of activated T cells isolated from CD patients and healthy control subjects. The failure of etanercept in IBD therapy can be attributed to its inability, in contrast to infliximab and adalimumab, to inhibit T cell proliferation and to induce regulatory macrophages, caused probably by differences in infliximab and etanercept binding to TNF. 4. TL1A TL1A (TNF-like molecule 1A; TNFSF15) is the most recently discovered member of the TNF superfamily, identified for the first time in 2002. In humans, there are three different isoforms of the protein generated from TNFSF15gene as a result of alternative splicing: VEGI-174 (174 amino acids), VEGI-192 (192 amino acids), and the full-length product, TL1A (VEGI-252; 252 amino acids), although VEGI-174 is most probably a cloning artefact. Primary function of VEGI-192 is the inhibition of angiogenesis, whereas TL1A is a proinflammatory factor involved in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including arthritis, allergic lung inflammation, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Similarly to TNF, TL1A exists in a soluble or transmembrane form. It has been shown that recombinant human TL1A forms a homotrimer resembling the trimeric structure of other TNF superfamily members; however, still very little is known about the quaternary structure of the native form of TL1A molecule. TL1A expression is primarily found on activated cells of the immune system, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, whereas very little TL1A was found on nonactivated immune cells. Known inducers of TL1A expression are TNF, IL-1, Fc fragments of IgG1 antibodies, and certain parasite- or bacteria-related toll-like receptors (TLR) ligands, including synthetic bacterial lipoprotein Pam3CSK4 (ligand for TLR1 and TLR2), lipopeptide FSL (ligand for TLR2), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (ligand for TLR3), LPS (ligand for TLR4), single-stranded RNA (ligand for TLR7), unmethylated DNA sequences (ligands for TLR9), and tachyzoite antigen (ligand for TLR11). The main receptor for TL1A is death receptor 3 (DR3; TNFRSF25), structurally similar to TNFR1. DR3 was found to be strongly upregulated on activated monocytes, NK cells, NKT cells, and B cells, as well as CD4(+) T helper and CD8(+) T cytotoxic cells. TL1A, similarly to FasL and LIGHT, binds also soluble decoy receptor 3 (DcR3, TNFRSF6B) which prevents functional TL1A/DR3 signalling. Even though DR3 contains the death domain, TL1A has been shown to induce apoptosis only in the erythroleukaemic cell line TF-1 treated with an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide (CHX). In activated T cells, however, TL1A did not induce apoptosis even in the presence of CHX. Instead, TL1A/DR3 interactions in lymphocytes triggered proliferative and costimulatory signals through activation of NF-κB-mediated pathways. Thus, TL1A is a proinflammatory molecule which primarily costimulates proliferation and effector functions of CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells as well as Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells in the presence of TCR stimulation; however, in physiological conditions, TL1A is not required for the differentiation of these lymphocytes. Furthermore, TL1A promotes also maturation of dendritic cells and production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, MCP-1) by macrophages. Apart from conventional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, TL1A/DR3 interaction promotes also proliferation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), although sustained TL1A stimulation in vitro dampens suppressive activity of Tregs. Interestingly, in vitro studies also showed that TL1A inhibited differentiation of Tregs from their precursor cells. Certain alleles of TNFSF15gene which encode TL1A are associated with enhanced activity of TNFSF15promoter region and are considered to increase susceptibility to Crohn's disease. TL1A protein and mRNA were upregulated in IBD and their synthesis was localized in CD patients to lamina propria infiltrating cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells as well as plasma cells isolated from colon mucosa of UC patients. IBD patients had also a higher proportion of DR3-expressing lamina propria T cells than healthy subjects and the amount of TL1A protein as well as the number of TL1A-positive cells correlated positively with the severity of inflammation, most significantly in CD. Furthermore, studies on transgenic mice showed that constitutive elevated expression of TL1A on T cells or dendritic cells resulted in enhanced T cell activation and upregulation of IL-13, IL-17A, and IFN-γ mRNA levels in intestinal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes as well as spontaneous development of bowel inflammation. Recently, a population of CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells has been identified as a primary target of TL1A in IBD, although other subpopulations of T cells may also respond to TL1A costimulation. CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells express DR3 and their gut tropism is established by high expression of intestine-homing molecules such as integrin β7 and chemokine CCR6. They bear characteristics of Th17 cells and have been shown to produce proinflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-22, and IL-13. In inflammatory conditions, however, they may revert their phenotype to Th1 type and produce IFN-γ. In synergy with other proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12 and IL-18 or IL-23, TL1A further enhances the inflammatory process by increasing production of IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-6 by lymphocytes. Thus, TL1A involvement in IBD pathomechanisms may result from enhanced costimulation of effector T cells and local upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines production in parallel to defective generation of peripheral Tregs and inhibition of suppressive activity of preexisting Tregs. As one of the key regulators of inflammatory pathways, TL1A appears to be a promising therapeutic target for patients with T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, including IBD, although to this day none of TL1A blocking agents has yet been tested in clinical trials. There are, however, reports showing that antibody-mediated inhibition of TL1A biological activity prevents the development of dextran sodium sulphate- (DSS-) induced and T cell transfer-induced experimental bowel inflammation in mice. 5. FasL Fas ligand (FasL, CD95L, and TNFSF6) and its receptor Fas (CD95, TNFRSF6) are other members of the TNF superfamily involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. Cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells use FasL to kill tumour cells or viruses-infected cells which express Fas. FasL is involved also in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity via a mechanism known as activation-induced cell death (AICD) which relies on killing activated T cells following their expansion and differentiation in a FasL-/Fas-dependent manner, thus preventing hyperactivation of T cell-mediated immunity. FasL is a transmembrane molecule, although it can be enzymatically cleaved from cells. An in vivo mouse study showed, however, that only the transmembrane, but not soluble, FasL was capable of triggering cell death. In contrast to Fas which is constitutively or inducibly expressed on many different cell types, including colon epithelial cells, FasL expression is tightly regulated and limited to activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, NK cells, and monocytes. In physiological conditions, Paneth cells are the only cells of the intestinal epithelium which express FasL. Expression of FasL was found also in tissues and organs that lack resident or infiltrating lymphocytes (e.g., eye, trophoblast, or testis) and on neurons and astrocytes as well as in several tumours where it may contribute to the suppression of local immune responses via induction of T cell apoptosis. The majority of studies concerning the role of FasL and Fas in IBD have been conducted in patients with ulcerative colitis rather than Crohn's disease. Expression of FasL was significantly elevated on CD3(+) lymphocytes infiltrating colonic lamina propria in patients with active UC but not in UC remission, active or remission CD, or healthy subjects. Furthermore, serum concentration of systemic soluble Fas was lower in patients with active UC compared to healthy controls. Nevertheless, there are also studies which showed upregulation of FasL in colonic lamina propria and intraepithelial lymphocytes of CD patients' mucosa. The exact role of Fas/FasL system in IBD has not been fully elucidated. Taking into account the primary, proapoptotic function of Fas/FasL signalling, its possible role in IBD initially appeared to be similar to TNF/TNFR1 signalling: intestinal epithelial cells expressing Fas targeted by FasL(+) lymphocytes undergo apoptosis which may lead to the increased permeability of intestinal epithelium. Indeed, an in vitro study demonstrated that ligation of Fas resulted in apoptotic death of intestinal epithelial cells isolated from mucosa of UC patients. This concept was supported also by the fact that in healthy colon expression of FasL was restricted only to few mononuclear cells of lamina propria, suggesting that proapoptotic function of Fas/FasL system was not involved in regeneration of colonic epithelium but in pathogenesis of IBD. A more recent study, however, showed that colonocytes isolated from patients with active UC had attenuated response to Fas-mediated apoptosis induction compared to healthy subjects and patients in remission. Furthermore, authors of two mouse studies demonstrated that Fas-deficient mice were hypersensitive to dextran sodium sulphate- (DSS-) induced colitis and did not show any significant reduction in tissue damage, even though they exhibited an increased rate of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis in gut inflammation model based on administration of T cell activating anti-CD3 antibody. These findings suggest that colonocytes may activate cytoprotective programs in response to inflammation and may not be oversensitive to Fas-dependent apoptosis as had been initially proposed. Several studies showed that T cells from inflamed mucosa of CD and UC patients were more resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis than control T cells from healthy individuals. Suzuki et al. found that in UC mucosa the population of CD45RO(+)CD4(+) T cells was less prone to Fas-mediated cell death than the population of CD45RO(+)CD8(+) T cells. Thus, potentially harmful, proinflammatory T cells may accumulate in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients and induce tissue damage. Fas and FasL, while playing an important role in the regulation of apoptosis, have also nonapoptotic functions. Fas contains the death domain and, in contrast to TNFR1, had been thought to be involved only in proapoptotic but not prosurvival signalling. However, it has been shown recently that although strong Fas stimulation blocked activation of human CD4(+) helper T cells, weak Fas stimulation together with TCR signalling augmented their proliferation via activation of MAP kinases, transcription factors, and cell cycle activators. FasL contributes to costimulation of T cells also by a phenomenon termed “reverse signalling.” Under this condition ligation of transmembrane FasL by functional Fas or DcR3 (a soluble decoy receptor for FasL, TL1A, and LIGHT) triggers signal transduction from FasL, resulting in the enhanced proliferation of mouse CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells. These findings add much more complexity to possible roles of Fas/FasL system in the pathomechanisms of IBD which, theoretically, can be involved not only in direct disruption of epithelial continuity but also in costimulation of proinflammatory T cells. Since the details of Fas/FasL role in IBD still remain largely unknown, agents directly interfering with Fas signalling have yet not been tested for IBD treatment. 6. LIGHT  LIGHT (lymphotoxin-like inducible protein that competes with glycoprotein D for binding herpesvirus entry mediator on T cell, TNFSF14), ligand for the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR, TNFRSF3), and the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM; TNFRSF14) are expressed mostly on activated T cells, although they were found also on monocytes, granulocytes, and immature dendritic cells. LTβR and HVEM receptors do not contain the death domain; therefore they are considered to be involved in prosurvival signalling. Indeed, interaction between LIGHT and HVEM was found to enhance proliferation and effector functions of CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells, stimulate expansion of CD4(+) helper T cells, and promote their differentiation into Th1 cells. Several studies indicate that LIGHT contributes to the development of intestinal inflammation. Transgenic mice with elevated expression of LIGHT spontaneously develop colitis. Adoptive transfer of mesenteric lymph node cells expressing LIGHT into immunodeficient RAG−/− mice resulted in Th1-mediated intestinal inflammation dependent on both LIGHT receptors (LTβR and HVEM). Furthermore, induction of colitis in mice by DSS resulted in strong upregulation of LIGHT mRNA in colon mucosa, whereas LIGHT-deficient mice showed significantly reduced symptoms of DSS-induced colon inflammation. The pathological role of LIGHT in human IBD has been hardly investigated, although in IBD patients upregulation of LIGHT mRNA in inflamed intestinal mucosa when compared to noninflamed areas has been demonstrated. Blockade of LIGHT as a way of IBD treatment has not been tested in clinical settings, although administration of anti-LIGHT antibodies reduced symptoms of DSS-induced colon inflammation in mice. 7. DcR3 DcR3, soluble receptor for TL1A, FasL, and LIGHT, is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily that does not contain the transmembrane domain. As a soluble receptor, it inhibits the interaction between its ligands and their membrane-bound receptors, thus suppressing their biological activity. Elevated expression of DcR3 was detected in inflamed mucosa and serum of CD and UC patients. The biological significance of this phenomenon remains unclear, although DcR3 is thought to play a protective role in IBD. For example, Funke et al. showed that DcR3, acting as a soluble decoy receptor, limited the bioavailability of FasL and protected intestinal epithelial cells from FasL-mediated apoptosis. In a similar way, DcR3 may also prevent the proinflammatory effect exerted by TL1A; thus, it has been proposed that upregulation of DcR3 expression during intestinal inflammation may have a compensatory, protective effect. 8. TRAIL Certain reports indicate that another member of the TNF superfamily, TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand, TNFSF10), expressed in a large variety of tissues including intestines may be involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. Similarly to TNF, TRAIL is able to induce apoptosis and can also activate the prosurvival transcription factor NF-κB. Five receptors of TRAIL have been identified to date. TRAIL-R1 (TNFRSF10A; DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (TNFRSF-10B; DR5) contain the death domain in their cytoplasmic fragments and are involved in functional TRAIL signalling. Other molecules, TRAIL-R3 (TNFRSF10C; DcR1) without the death domain and TRAIL-R4 (TNFRSF10D; DcR2) with defective death domain and soluble osteoprotegerin (OPG, TNFRSF11B), are considered to be decoy receptors. Expression of TRAIL was found to be downregulated in intestinal epithelial cells of IBD patients; however, it was significantly elevated in mononuclear cells of the resected inflamed mucosa in both CD and UC patients with highly active, steroid-refractory disease. Even though the exact role of TRAIL in IBD pathogenesis remains undefined, the available data suggest that TRAIL-expressing mononuclear cells present in lamina propria disrupt the integrity of intestinal epithelium by inducing apoptosis of enterocytes. This notion was supported by an ex vivo study on ileal organ cultures which revealed that under inflammatory conditions TRAIL became a potent inducer of apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells. TRAIL is also a potent mediator of apoptotic death of intestinal fibroblasts in fibrostenosing intestinal areas in CD. Since collagen deposits and fibroblast proliferation are factors contributing to the development of strictures and fistulas, relatively common in CD patients, TRAIL can be involved also in tissue remodelling associated with CD. 9. TWEAK TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis, TNFSF12) acts through its receptor Fn14 (TNFRSF12; TWEAK-R) and has multiple biological activities, including stimulation of cell growth, induction of proinflammatory cytokines, and, in certain experimental settings, induction of apoptosis. TWEAK protein is expressed mostly in immune cells such as T cells, macrophages, or dendritic cells, although it was found also in nonhematopoietic cell types like astrocytes or endothelial cells. Expression of TWEAK receptor, Fn14, was found on a variety of cells, including cells of intestinal mucosa. Fn14 does not contain the death domain and its stimulation with TWEAK results in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. There are very few studies concerning the role of TWEAK in IBD pathogenesis; however in the intestinal mucosa of UC patients messenger RNA levels of IL-13, TWEAK, and Fn14 increased with disease activity. TWEAK deficiency or reduction of its biological activity by anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibodies reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, neutrophil, and macrophage infiltration decreasing severity of trinitrobenzenesulfonic (TNBS) acid-induced colitis in mice. Furthermore, even though TWEAK alone did not induce damage or apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, it was required, together with Fn14 and TNF, for IL-13-induced activation of caspase-3 in enterocytes isolated from γ-irradiated mice. In vitro studies on rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Kym-1 showed that TWEAK upregulated expression of transmembrane TNF which in turn induced cell apoptosis via TNFR1. Furthermore, TWEAK stimulation synergistically enhanced TNFR1-mediated apoptotic cell death of Kym-1 cells which can be explained by the fact that TWEAK induces translocation of antiapoptotic adaptor protein TRAF2 from the TNFR1 signalling complex, enhancing proapoptotic signalling of this receptor. The question whether these mechanisms are active also in vivo in intestinal epithelium has not yet been studied.",5865
20537165,"Background Crohn's disease (CD) belongs to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that are characterized by chronic, relapsing and recurrent inflammation of intestinal mucosa. The disease is thought to result from the action of environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. Three variants in the NOD2 , IBD5 locus and one variant in the IL23R  and in the ATG16L1  have been independently confirmed to be associated with CD, including associations found previously in the Czech population. Recent studies, however, show that this list is far from being complete. The CTLA4 gene may also be considered as a plausible candidate for a genetic association with IBD. Its product, the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) is a T-cell suppressor which plays an essential role in the function of the CD25(+)CD4(+) regulatory cells that control the process of intestinal inflammation. The CTLA4 gene maps within the 2q33 region that has been found to carry suggestive linkage significance for IBD. The CTLA4 gene is associated with other immunopathologic diseases (type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease, Addison's disease, celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, vitiligo). Among the studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the CT60 (rs3087243) shows the most prominent associations, being followed by other three SNPs: JO31 (rs11571302), JO30 (rs7565213) and JO27-1 (rs11571297). A recent publication has shown evidence for association of another SNP within the CTLA4 with type 1 diabetes, the rs1427676. Previously published papers about genetic association with CD tested three variants in the CTLA4 gene: g.49A > G (rs231775), g.-318C > T (rs5742909) and the previously mentioned CT60, having found no association. However, several works suggested that CTLA4 variants may influence the phenotype of CD. The aim of this study was to assess the association in the Czech population, using a set of markers previously shown to associate with other diseases. Results Crude associations The frequencies of the variants and respective OR are listed in Table 3. No crude associations with CD were found for the tested SNPs under the log-additive or dominant models. The genotype distributions in control subjects conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all SNPs (p > 0.20) except the rs1427676 (p = 0.014 in exact tests) which was therefore excluded from all further analyses. As the part of chromosome under the CTLA4 gene is divided into the several blocks we performed a haplotype analysis using the five SNPs; no crude association with CD was observed (data not shown). Interaction of the CTLA4 SNPs with variants in IL23R and NOD2 We then tested possible interactions between variants in the CTLA4 and polymorphisms in other genes previously associated with CD: NOD2 gene p.Leu1007fsX1008 (c.3020insC), IL23R gene rs11209026 (c.1142G > A), see Figure 1. This was done in dominant models using an R-project package 'SNPassoc' version 1.5-2. Significant interactions were observed between the three CTLA4 variants (CT60, JO31, JO27-1) and NOD2 p.Leu1007fsX1008, and the same variants in the CTLA4 and IL23R rs11209026. For a quantification of the CTLA4 association stratified by the above NOD2 and IL23R polymorphisms see Table 4 a Table 5: the minor alleles of the CT60, JO31 and JO27-1 within the CTLA4 modified the risk of Crohn's disease in the stratum of subjects carrying the frameshift insertion p.Leu1007fsX1008 in NOD2, while no perceivable effect of CTLA4 was found in the stratum of p.Leu1007fsX1008 wild-type homozygotes. Similarly, the three CTLA4 variants clearly, albeit moderately, decreased the risk of CD in the stratum of subjects carrying minor alleles of rs11209026 within the IL23R (G/A and A/A), while no effect was observed in the IL23R wild-type homozygotes. The effect was observable also for the haplotype consisting of the three minor alleles of the variants in tight linkage disequilibrium, the CT60 ""A"", JO31 ""T"", JO27-1 ""G"" haplotype. Genotype - phenotype analysis Using a case-only design, we tested whether the phenotypic characteristics of the patients are dependent on carriage status of the minor alleles at CTLA4 variants. Table 6 shows logistic regression with the outcomes of clinical characteristics and the three CTLA4 variants and the haplotype as the predictors. The pediatric-onset patients differed to the adult-onset patients in their frequencies of the minor allele at the CT60 (74% versus 63%, p = 0.03). The CT60, JO31 and JO27-1 SNPs, as well as their ""ATG"" haplotype retained their associations with the age at diagnosis after adjustment to the effect of the NOD2 variant (p.Leu1007fsX1008). No difference between pediatric and adult-onset group was found for the other two variants in the CTLA4 gene, data not shown. The CTLA4 variants were weakly associated with the ileal-only (L1) and ileocolonic involvement (L3) in a dominant manner, while no association was observed with any of the remaining clinical characteristics: localization in the upper gastrointestinal tract, the stricturing or penetrating behavior of the disease, perianal disease, extraintestinal manifestation, or the need for abdominal surgery (data not shown).",796
18715515,"Background Identification of the mechanisms of autoimmune inflammatory disease development in the gastrointestinal tract is an emerging topic of research. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is thought to result from immune-mediated tissue injury, primed by the enteric microflora, in genetically predisposed subjects. IBD phenotypically occurs in the form of Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). In these disorders, chronic mucosal inflammation results from inappropriate and overreactive mucosal response to intestinal bacteria followed by activation of inflammatory cells and production of inflammatory mediators. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the hepatic bile ducts that likely develops as a result of an inappropriate immune mediated process. Nearly 80% of northern European PSC patients also have concomitant IBD, mostly in the form of UC. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is another autoimmune chronic cholestatic liver disorder that may also develop as a result of an abnormal immune response to stimulating environmental or infectious agents. As in other autoimmune diseases, the specific alleles of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex represent genes associated with susceptibility to PSC, PBC and IBD. It has been reported that the genetic predisposition to CD is caused by alterations in several genes, including NOD2/CARD15, OCTN1, OCTN2, DLG, ATG16L1 and IL23R . Several other non-HLA genes are also involved in PCS and PBC disease susceptibility. According to our current understanding of CD, PSC and PBC are complex diseases in which the genetic determinants contributing to disease susceptibility interact with environmental factors. However, the mechanisms underlying these interactions remain unclear. Considering high frequency at which IBD and PSC are diagnosed together, close spatial proximity of affected organs, and the fact that common immune mediated processes are likely involved in development of these diseases, searching for common risk alleles for IBD and autoimmune cholestatic liver disorders seems to be relevant Most of the susceptibility genes are considered to not be directly involved in disease pathogenesis, but rather act as environmental response modifiers. Given their subtle individual impact on disease susceptibility, independently they may have little to no effect on disease progression and likely act in collaboration with other factors to promote disease development. Moreover, disease genetic markers vary among the populations studied, despite the phenotypic similarity of disease. Thus, analyzing the genetic background of disease is an important challenge, and several studies have been performed with the purpose of finding similarities in the molecular mechanism of development of different inflammatory disorders of the alimentary tract. The aim of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms of CD susceptibility genes are predisposing factors to the development of PSC and PBC in a group of Polish patients. Results and Discussion Allelic distributions for all polymorphisms studied in the patient and control groups are shown in Table 1, while genotype counts for each of the studied groups are presented in Additional file 1 [see Additional file 1]. In the control group, the genotype distributions for all polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05). The Caspase Recruitment Activation Domain 15 (NOD2/CARD15) gene is located in the proximal region of chromosome 16 (16q12) and encodes the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2), which is a cytosolic receptor for a bacterial peptidoglycan response pathway. Mutations in NOD2 result in immune system dysfunctions and are considered causative genetic factors in the development of CD. NOD2/CARD15 mutations are also associated with susceptibility to other granulomatous inflammatory disorders, such as early-onset sarcoidosis and Blau syndrome. Three of the four NOD2/CARD15 variants tested (rs2066842, rs2066844, rs5743293) were strongly associated with CD (Table 2). In particular, a strong association was observed with Pro268Ser and 1007fs SNPs with odds ratio (OR) values over 10. Increased values of OR for homozygous risk genotypes confirm previously described codominance of these variants. The observed allele distribution was similar to those reported in other Caucasian CD patient groups. The autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1) gene encodes the protein component of the autophagosome pathway of intracellular bacteria processing. The T300A variant (rs2241880) was previously considered to be a risk factor for CD development. In our CD patients, however, this variant demonstrated only a weak associaf2tion with CD, as the p-value (= 0.022) did not pass the Bonferroni corrected significance threshold level of 0.008. The organic cation transporters from the family of solute carrier protein (SLC22A4/OCTN1 and SLC22A5/OCTN2) genes are located on chromosome 5 (5q31) within the IBD5 region. The 1672C/T (Leu503Phe) missense variant of SLC22A4/OCTN1 (rs1050152) potentially alters the carnitine adsorption and the exchange of other positively charged compounds between the cell and extracellular matrix. Also included in this study is the G-to-C transversion in the SLC22A5/OCTN2 promoter (rs2631367), which is thought to affect a heat shock transcription factor binding element. The variants of both genes were previously found in linkage disequilibrium, enabling the selection of a two-allele CD risk haplotype. This finding, however, has not been confirmed by other studies. As shown in Table 3, there was a weak association between the protective OCTN1/OCTN2 CC haplotype and CD (OR = 0.28; CI = 0.08 – 0.94; p = 0.0298). A strong linkage disequilibrium was found between the NOD2/CARD15 Pro268Ser loci and three other studied loci of NOD2/CARD15. Analyses of reconstructed haplotypes for each patient group showed that the odds of TC haplotype of Pro268Ser and 1007fs loci is approximately ten times higher (OR = 10.26; CI = 4.52 – 23.29; p = 0.0000000000671) among patients with CD compared to healthy controls. The interleukine-23 receptor (IL23R) gene is located on chromosome region 1p31, and encodes a subunit of the IL23 receptor. IL23 and IL6 activate the STAT3 transcription factor which in turn leads to differentiation of CD4+ helper T cells into Th17 cells that function in driving autoimmune inflammation by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22. Genetic variants of IL23R were identified as disease-associated factors in chronic inflammatory disorders, such as IBD, psoriasis, T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease of the skin, and ankylosing spondylitis, indicating the involvement of the IL23/IL23R pathway in the etiology of various autoimmune-related disorders. Several genetic non-coding variants of this gene demonstrated independent risk association with CD, while the rare variant in the coding region of IL23R (1142G/A; Arg381Gln; rs11209026) has been regarded as a CD protective variant. We did not find any association of CD not only with Arg381Gln, but also two other more frequent variants of IL23R. The frequency of the G/A genotype of rs11209026 SNP was 3.3% in CD (2 of 60) compared to 5.8% (8 of 139) in controls, and only one of the patients and controls was homozygous for the AA genotype (not significant). Thus, although this rare variant was found at a similar proportion to that described from the genome-wide scan-based population studies (2.5–3.0% versus 6.2–6.8%), our small group of CD patients (N = 60) was insufficient to reach statistical significance for this disproportion. The Drosophila disc large homolog 5 (DLG5) gene, mapped to chromosome 10 (10q23), is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase gene family and encodes a protein involved in maintaining the correct shape, polarity and growth of cells. The functional variant (113G/A, Arg30Gln, rs1248696) has been proposed to potentially lead to serious abnormalities in both the structure and function of cells. Although the first study of Stoll et al.  reported an association between genetic variants in DLG5 and IBD, the more recent meta-analysis of published data on Arg30Gln question this association. Our study did not show any association between the Arg30Gln variant of DLG5 and CD. In contrast to CD patients, none of the polymorphisms showed association with PSC and PBC, two disorders of autoimmune etiology. Furthermore, no significant associations were detected in PSC patients with concurrent IBD. These negative results are consistent with the recently published studies in Scandinavian PSC patients, the largest PSC population in which genotyping has been performed, and in a group of Hungarian and Polish patients with PBC. The present study confirms a strong association of NOD2/CARD15 gene variants, and to a lesser extent the coding ATG16L1 variant and the OCTN1/OCTN2 haplotype, with CD in a relatively small Polish Caucasian patient group. There was no evidence for significant association between variants of IL23R or DLG5 and CD. However, because small sample size significantly limits estimation of genetic variant disproportion, especially with a low prevalence of allelic frequency, whether the result represents a true negative association or a false negative finding is somewhat disputable, mainly due to insufficient power of statistical tests. In fact, calculation of the statistical testing power reached decent values only for the three main NOD2/CARD15 variants (Table 4). Therefore, considering SNP frequencies, small patient groups and measured effect size, our studies might not be able to confirm existing weak and even moderate disease associations.",1442
18433468,"Background Biological and epidemiological data indicate a clear association between chronic inflammation and malignancy. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Epidemiological and linkage studies strongly suggest the involvement of genetic factors in IBD, especially those associated with inflammation. Recently, it has been shown that the NOD2/CARD15 (nucleotide oligomerisation domain 2/caspase activating recruitment domain 15) gene is implicated in the susceptibility to Crohn's disease. NOD2/CARD15 is expressed intracellularly in monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes, where it activates the nuclear factor NF-κB, making it responsive to bacterial lipopolysaccharides which culminate in the activation of apoptosis. Patients harbouring mutant NOD2 alleles are presumably deficient in the activation of NF-κB and consequently the appropriate response to bacterial infection. Among patients with CD, the frequency of C-insertion mutation in exon 11 of NOD2 is about three times higher compared to control populations. In a previous investigation, we found a significant association between the NOD2 frameshift constitutional mutation (3020insC) and the risk of colorectal cancer in patients diagnosed above the age of 50 years (OR = 2.23; p = 0.0046). The association between IBD and polymorphisms in other inflammation-related genes involved in the innate immune response like DLG5, IL-4, OCTN, TNFα have been reported but their relationship to disease risk requires further investigation. Together, the associations between polymorphisms in inflammatory response genes and IBD make them attractive candidate susceptibility genes for colorectal cancer since approximately 1:6 individuals with IBD will develop malignancy. In addition, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that remodeling of the immune system with age may also alter cancer risk and consequently alterations in the activity of TNFα may become more pronounced with age. In the present study, we evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a number of inflammatory response genes are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Ten SNPs in the following six genes: NOD2 (2140 C/T, 2722 G/C), DLG5 (113 G/A), OCTN1 (1672 C/T), OCTN2 (-207 G/C), IL4 (-590 C/T) and TNFα (-308 G/A, -857 C/T, -863 C/A, -1031 T/C) were screened in a consecutive series of colorectal cancer patients using a two-staged approach. Results The study was performed in two stages to ensure that the Polish population frequencies of the chosen polymorphisms were no different to that reported in the NCBI SNP database. During the first stage of the study ten polymorphisms in six genes were analysed and no significant differences in the frequencies of nine of the variants was observed in the CRC group compared to the newborn control population. Only one polymorphism (TNFα -1031 T/T) showed a tendency towards being over-represented in the CRC group compared to the newborn control population. The frequency of the TNFα -1031 T/T genotype was 71.4% in the CRC group against 64.9% in the newborn control population. To better define the relationship between the TNFα -1031T/T SNP and cancer risk a further 257 consecutively collected CRC patients were assayed for the presence of the T/T genotype and the results compared to an adult control population that has been matched for year of birth, age, sex and domicile (Table 1). The results reveal that the -1031T/T genotype in the CRC group overall when compared to the control population was not significantly different in its frequency (71.0% vs 67.7%). When the consecutively collected CRC group was stratified for age of diagnosis, there appeared to be an association of the TNFα -1031T/T SNP with later ages of disease diagnosis (see Table 1). Previously we have shown in the Polish population that the NOD2 3020insC mutation is associated with CRC risk, which remained in this new analysis (Table 1). A combined analysis of patients harbouring the NOD2 mutation and the TNFα -1031T/T SNP was performed. The combined analysis was performed on 607 CRC patients and 607 matched healthy controls in order to determine if the TNFα -1031 T/T SNP acts in association with the NOD2 3020insC change. From this analysis a total of 41 cases were identified in the CRC group compared to 27 in the control group, which revealed an over-representation of the two SNPs in the CRC group compared to the control group (OR 1.50, p = 0.45). The average age of disease onset in persons harbouring both polymorphisms compared to those only harbouring the TNFα -1031T/T change was found to 69.8 years of age (range 48–84) compared to non-carriers 65.3 years of age (range 30–92), which was not statistically significant. Conversely, we observed a trend toward a protective effect in that there was an under-representation of the TNFα -1031 C/C and NOD2 3020insC negative carriers in the CRC population (OR 0.49, p = 0.45) (see Table 2). When stratified by age, the association between the TNFα -1031 T/T and NOD2 3020insC carriers and disease became more apparent (see Table 3) with age thereby providing further evidence that these two polymorphisms are associated with later onset disease.",819
24352087,"1. Introduction Crohn’s disease (CD) is one of two commonly identified inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) the other being ulcerative colitis (UC). Both disorders are inflammatory and people experience phases of remission and deterioration. The incidence of CD seems to be increasing and it appears that New Zealand (NZ) in 2006 had the highest rate at 16.5/105. Increases are observed particularly in the western world, and research has shown that the environment plays a considerable role. It has been observed that individuals from Bangladesh (where the incidence of IBD is very low) on shifting to the United Kingdom, develop a very high incidence of IBD within a generation. Nutrition is thought to play a key role and is considered to be an important environmental factor influencing the development of CD and its symptoms, through the nutrigenomic and epigenetic modification of the susceptibility genes. Vegetables, especially Brassicaceae, are often shunned by people with CD because of the negative effects they are alleged to have on their symptoms. However, Brassicaceae supply key nutrients. Some varieties of Brassicaceae also appear to be well tolerated by people with CD. Several studies show that Brassicaceae contain many significant nutrients: fibre, the antioxidants vitamin A and C, the vitamin folate and vitamin K and the minerals such as potassium, calcium, selenium and zinc as well as the numerous phytochemicals which have key roles in maintaining health. They help improve immunity as well as contributing to anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities of the body. The intake of sufficient amounts of these nutrients is important for people with CD. These nutrients are necessary to meet the daily intakes as recommended in the Nutrient Reference Values for Australia and New Zealand. By studying the interaction of different Brassicaceae varieties with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in people with CD, it may be possible to uncover a genetic basis for individual tolerances. This could lead to more specific nutrition advice with respect to these important vegetables, and enhance the opportunities for CD patients to avail themselves of the benefits of Brassicaceae. The aim of this study was therefore to identify the candidate genes involved in the beneficial or adverse effects of the Brassicaceae most commonly eaten as reported by NZ adults from the “Genes and Diet in IBD Study”, based in Auckland.  3. Results Table 2 shows the candidate genes. Table 3 shows the SNPs that were significantly associated with beneficial effects while Table 4 shows the significant SNPs which were associated with adverse effects on the symptoms of people with CD. Table S1 shows the Brassicacea frequencies [n(%)] by SNPS. A total of 37 variants were identified as having beneficial effects (p values from 0.00097 to 0.0497) and 64 SNPs with adverse effects (0.0000751 to 0.049). After correcting for multiple testing, two SNPs in two genes remained significant with adverse reactions to Brassicaceae. The rs7515322 variant in DIO1 was associated with Broccoli, and the rs9469220 variant in HLA was associated with rocket. These p-values were marked with an asterisk (*) (Table 4).",501
31844038,"Background Crohn’s disease (CD) is a major component of chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease, which primarily affects the terminal ileum and colon. A prospective, population-based study showed that the incidence rate for CD was as high as 1.09 per 100 000 person-years in China. Although the CD prevalence in China is still lower than that in Western countries, this figure has increased rapidly over the past few decades. The underlying etiology of CD is still undetermined, but it has long been thought as a consequence of an inappropriate mucosal immune response to antigenic stimulation from the gut microbiota in a genetically susceptible host. Studies from twins suggested an approximately 50% genetic contribution in CD. Therefore, the identification of the related genetic changes that are implicated in CD susceptibility would provide insights into the etiology of this disorder. To the best of our knowledge, over 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes (such as NOD2/CARD15, NOD1/CARD4, and ABCB1) are related to CD in Western populations. However, due to genetic differences, some SNPs failed to show a link to CD in the Asian population. For example, mutations within genes from the NOD2/CARD15, ATG16L1, and IL23/Th17 signaling pathways were demonstrated to confer susceptibility to CD only in Western patients and not in Chinese and Japanese patients. In addition, studies in the Asian population have revealed some unique SNPs, e.g., c.374T>C of the DLG1 gene in Chinese patients, ATG16L2 and/or FCHSD2 in Chinese and South Korean patients, and SNPs in the TNFSF15 gene in East Asians. These differences emphasize the importance of identifying population-specific gene variants. Perianal fistula CD (pCD) is a subtype of CD with poor prognosis and low quality of life. According to population-based studies, the proportion of pCD ranges from 12% to 40% among CD patients, and this prevalence varies according to disease location and disease duration. A European project has revealed that perianal fistula formation in CD patients might be attributed to genes including IL23R, LOC441108, PRDM1, and NOD2. Another study in the Italian population suggested an association of the SNP rs4958847 in the IRGM gene with the susceptibility to pCD. Studies in Dutch, German, and Norwegian populations found an association between rs2165047 in the DLG5 gene and the NOD2 haplotype with perianal development. Furthermore, rs72796353 in NOD2 was also reported to be significantly associated with perianal fistula development in cases devoid of SNPs rs2066844, rs2066845, and rs2066847. Among the Asian population, only 2 studies have screened potentially pathogenic SNPs in CD patients and explored their associations with perianal fistula formation. One recent study was conducted in a Japanese population and found that the AT haplotype in the TNFRSF1B gene might promote fistula development, while another study in a Korean population revealed the association of the rs4574921 CC genotype within the TNFSF15 gene with perianal fistula formation. However, susceptibility genes and SNPs have never been assessed in the Chinese population. In addition, to reveal the unique gene variants predisposing patients to pCD, it is important to identify the differences in susceptibility genes and SNPs between non-perianal CD (npCD) patients and pCD patients, which have yet to be evaluated. Here, we extended previous findings in the Asian population by assessing the association between the CD susceptibility loci reported in Asians to Southern Chinese CD patients to clarify the specificity of CD susceptibility genes in the Chinese population and further compare the frequencies of those loci between pCD and npCD patients to explore the SNPs conferring susceptibility to pCD in the Chinese population. Results Characteristics Generally, CD patients were older than the controls. The patients with pCD were older than those with npCD (Table 1). The majority of cases were male in all 3 groups. In addition, higher percentages of patients with npCD than of those with pCD were single and had penetrating CD. Risk genetic loci screening In total, 90 genetic loci among 750 patients were identified (Supplementary Table 1). SNPs satisfying a detection rate >90%, MAF >5 and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were further screened, and 70 were obtained for further analysis (Supplementary Table 2). Correlation analysis of genotypes in CD patients Single SNP association analysis The frequency comparison between risk loci in CD patients and controls (Supplementary Table 3) indicated that 9 SNPs (rs10114470, rs3810936, rs6478109, rs6478108, rs4263839, rs7848647, rs4246905, rs457492, and rs6478106) were significantly related to CD (all with P<10−7 in Bonferroni multiplex analysis; Table 2). Among those SNPs, 5 were C>T mutations, 2 were G>A mutations, and the remaining 2 were T>C mutations. All those variants were located in the TNFSF15 gene on chromosome 9. Rs6478106 was the only SNP that presented correlation with the pathogenicity of CD (OR=2.15, 95% CI 1.94–3.26), while the remaining SNP exhibited protective roles against CD. We further assessed the genotype distribution of rs6478106 among different age and gender groups. The results indicated that there were no associations of rs6478106 with age (≤30 vs. >30, χ2=0.386, P=0.824) or sex (male versus female, χ2=2.096, P=0.351) (Table 3). Haplotype analysis Five SNPs (rs4574921, rs6478106, rs10114470, rs3810936, and rs4246905) were found in a 14-kb linkage disequilibrium region (block 1) on chromosome 9, while another 5 SNPs (rs4263839, rs6478108, rs6478109, rs7865494, and rs7848647) were found in a 17-kb linkage disequilibrium region (block 2) on chromosome 9. Haploview analysis showed that the haplotypes CCTTT, TTCCC, CCTCT and TCCTC in block 1 significantly increased the risk of CD (P<0.05). Correlation analysis between genotype distribution and perianal fistula of CD Correlation analysis between single SNP and perianal fistula of CD The comparison analysis between pCD and npCD patients (Supplementary Table 4) indicated that rs72553867, rs4958847, rs4409764, rs888208, rs3731772, and rs1292053 were candidate SNPs for susceptibility to CD perianal fistula (adjusted P<0.05, according to the Bonferroni test). Rs72553867, rs4958847, rs4409764, rs888208, rs3731772, and rs1292053 are located on chromosomes 5, 5, 10, 2, and 17, respectively. Among these candidates, rs72553867 (OR=1.685, 95% CI 1.188–2.390) and rs4958847 (OR=1.365, 95% CI 1.047–1.778) were found to be located in an IRGM coding region on chromosome 5. Rs4409764 (OR=1.329, 95 CI% 1.033–1.709) and rs888208 (OR=1.338, 95% CI 1.032–1.735) were found to be located in the NKX2–3 gene. Rs3731772 is in the AOX1 gene (OR=1.335, 95% CI 1.025–1.740), and rs1292053 was in the coding region of TUBD1 (OR=1.300, 95% CI 1.010–1.674) (Table 4). Adjusted analysis between single SNPs and perianal fistula of CD We further added age and gender as covariates to the analysis (Supplementary Table 5) and found that rs72553867 located in the IRGM gene on chromosome 5 (OR=1.770, 95% CI 1.151–2.723), rs4409764 located in the NKX2–3 gene on chromosome 10 (OR=1.886, 95% CI 1.181–3.012) and rs3731772 located in the AOX1 gene on chromosome 2 (OR=2.131, 95% CI 1.150–3.949) were SNPs that conferred susceptibility to pCD. Haplotype analysis Haplotype analysis revealed a 54-kb monomer block in chromosome 5 that contained 4 haplotypes, namely, CTCTAG, TCCCGA, TCACAA, and CTCTAA. Compared with the CTCTAG and CTCTAA haplotypes, haplotypes TCCCGA and TCACAA were associated with pCD (P<0.05).",1147

Introduction Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) compared to patients without DM2 exhibit increased risk of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), diabetic retinopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and peripheral neuropathy which are the major micro- and macrovascular complications of the disease. DKD affects 20-30% of patients suffering from DM2 and is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in most developed countries. Many pathways, mechanisms, and genes have been implicated in DKD development and progression including hyperglycemia, hypertension, inflammation, and oxidative stress (OS). OS along with the related genes is a pathway leading to DKD development as well as a mechanism related to major pathways responsible for diabetic damage. OS is defined by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and reduced ability of the innate antioxidant defense system which eventually cause insulin resistance, DNA, lipid and protein damage, and gene expression alterations. OS is present and enhanced from the early CKD stages to dialysis and is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. DM2-DKD heritability is multifactorial and heterogeneous. This implies that in populations of different ethnic background, a great number of gene polymorphisms and gene polymorphism combinations are implicated in DKD pathogenesis. Most DKD gene studies refer either to DM1 or to Afro-American, Asian, and American populations, but none has genotyped the Greek population. Yet, DM1 compared to DM2 and American and Asian populations compared to European exhibit a different and distinct genetic basis. Thus, only genetic results in DM2-DKD including European populations may be comparable to our study results. In addition, many genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses are aimed at revealing those polymorphisms that increase the risk for DKD development in DM2. Despite numerous gene locus identification, the results of the studies are inconsistent and the identification of gene variants robustly associated with DKD are limited. Our study is aimed at investigating which gene polymorphisms on the OS pathway are possibly associated with DKD in diabetic type 2 patients. 5. Results In this GWAS, we tried to discover possible associations between gene polymorphisms and DKD. Demographic, biochemical and clinical parameters of both case and control groups are shown in Table 1. Although no SNP achieved genome-wide statistical significance (p < 5 × 10−8), a statistically significant association for p < 0.05 was found for 43 SNPs and their corresponding genes. Some of these SNPs have been studied in the literature and have been either correlated with DKD presence or not reached statistical significance. The rest have not been reported yet.  Table 2 presents in order of statistical significance the SNPs and their corresponding genes that attained a p value of less than 0.05 and are possibly associated with DKD in DM2 patients of Greek origin. The minor allele responsible for the associated polymorphism, percentage of minor allele's presence in case and control groups, the major allele, χ2 values, and odds ratio (OR) along with confidence interval (CI) and standard error (SE) are also shown. In the case that a particular SNP is only found in the control group and thus the percentage of the SNP in the case group is 0%, then the OR calculation is 0 and the SE approaches infinity. On the contrary, when a particular SNP is only found in the case study group and thus the percentage of the SNP in the control group is 0%, then the OR and SE cannot be calculated. When OR for a specific SNP is greater than 1, it means that this SNP possibly contributes to DKD development. On the other hand, an OR below 1 implies that the specific SNP could possibly exhibit a protective role against DKD development in DM2 patients. In order of statistical significance the SNPs and their corresponding genes that possibly protect from DKD development in DM2 patients and attained a p value less than 0.05 include the following: in chromosome (chr.) 4 rs7685225-SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1), in chr.2 rs1567919-TPO (Thyroid Peroxidase) and rs13431646-TPO, in chr.11 rs486584-CCS (Copper Chaperone for Superoxide Dismutase), in chr.4 rs2725236-SPP1 and rs6833161-SPP1, in chr.8 rs7824574-CLU (Clusterin), in chr.17 rs14309-ALOX12 (arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase), in chr.6 rs1293928-IPCEF1 (Interaction Protein for Cytohesin Exchange Factors 1), in chr.8 rs10087808-OXR1 (Oxidation Resistance 1), in chr.2 rs2465661-AOX1 (Aldehyde Oxidase 1), in chr.7 rs6947821-NOS3 (nitric oxide synthase 3), in chr.8 rs10108813-OXR1 and rs1503573-OXR1, and in chr.20 rs6052780-PRNP (Prion Protein). On the other hand, the SNPs and their genes that possibly lead to DKD development in DM2 patients and attained a p value less than 0.05 in order of statistical significance include the following: in chr.2 rs6588678-TPO, rs56307213-TTN (Titin) and rs72648987-TTN, rs9678469-TPO, rs72650006-TTN, and rs17532665-SGO2 (Shugoshin 2); in chr.7 rs7830-NOS3; in chr.10 rs45458497-PDLIM1 (PDZ and LIM domain 1); in chr.2 rs17448235-SGO2; in chr.8 rs11780592-CLU, rs72677233-TTN, and rs72646855-TTN; in chr.19 rs201633492-GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4); in chr.22 rs201971987-TXNRD2 (Thioredoxin Reductase 2) and rs737866-TXNRD2; in chr.2 rs6732480-TPO; in chr.8 rs2741335-EPHX2 (Epoxide Hydroxylase 2); in chr.11 rs3019593-MTL5 (Metallothionein-Like Protein 5); in chr.2 rs2048727-TPO; in chr.17 rs9904720-EPX (Eosinophil Peroxidase); in chr.5 rs2230303-GPX3 (glutathione peroxidase 3); in chr.5 rs8177413-GPX3; in chr.22 rs12106549-TXNRD2; in chr.6 rs6905523-GSTA7P (soluble glutathione serine transferase alpha 7Ρ); in chr.6 rs35062161-GPX6 (glutathione peroxidase 6); in chr.8 rs10109171-OXR1; in chr.6 rs72944451-GSTA4; and in chr.17 rs11652709-EPX. From the aforementioned SNPs, the ones that have not been reported in the literature in correlation with diabetes or DKD are mentioned below. The TTN polymorphisms with statistical significance include rs56307213 (p = 0.002), rs72648987 (p = 0.002), and rs72650006 (p = 0.005), as well as rs72677233 (p = 0.019) and rs72646855 (p = 0.019) found only in the case group. These TTN SNPs possibly contribute to DKD development in DM2 patients. SGO2 rs17532665 (p = 0.005) and rs17448235 (p = 0.01) could be possibly leading to DKD development in DM2. PDLIM1 gene top hit found in our study was rs45458497 (p = 0,005), which could possibly exhibit a contributing role in DKD development in DM2 patients. CLU gene rs11780592 (p = 0.013) is possibly contributing to DKD development, and rs7824574 (p = 0.039) is possibly protecting from DKD occurrence in DM2 patients. CCS top hit was rs486584 (p = 0.019) which is possibly protective against DKD development in DM2 patients. Top hit polymorphism for GPX4 gene was rs201633492 (p = 0.019), identified only in the case group and possibly contributing to DKD development. TXNRD2 gene rs201971987 (p = 0.039) was identified only in the case study group while rs737866 (p = 0.020) and rs12106549 (p = 0.019) were found in both groups. These SNPs are possibly contributing to DKD development in DM2 patients. In our study, we also identified MTL5 rs3019593 (p = 0.033) possibly contributing to DKD development in DM2 patients. EPX gene rs9904720 (p = 0.035) and rs11652709 (p = 0.049) that gained statistical significance possibly contribute to DKD development in DM2 patients. Additionally, in our study, rs6905523 of GSTA7P pseudogene of the soluble glutathione serine transferases (GST gene family) and rs72944451 of GSTA4 have attained statistical significance (p = 0.041 and p = 0.049, respectively) and are possibly associated with DKD development. OXR1 gene top hit SNPs in our study included rs10087808 (p = 0.042), rs10108813 (p = 0.048), and rs1503573 (p = 0.049), which are possibly protective against DKD development, while rs10109171 (p = 0.044) is possibly involved in DKD development in DM2 patients. GPX6 gene rs35062161 attained statistical significance (p = 0.044) and is possibly associated with DKD development. PRNP gene top hit SNP in our study was rs6052780, which reached a p value of 0.049 and is possibly protective against DKD development. The rest of the SNPs have been reported in the literature in correlation with DKD and are further discussed.",1271

24931297,"Hyperprolinemia type I (HPI) results from a deficiency of proline oxidase (POX; enzyme commission no. [EC] 1.5.99.8), also called proline dehydrogenase(PRODH). The POX gene (PRODH) is located on chromosome 22 (22q11.21). This region is deleted in a congenital malformation syndrome known as velo-cardio-facial syndrome. This gene locus is also related to susceptibility to schizophrenia. Another form of hyperprolinemia is called hyperprolinemia type II (HPII). HPII is caused by a deficiency of Δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) dehydrogenase (P5CDh; EC 1.5.1.12) activity. The P5CDh gene (ALDH4A1) is located on chromosome1 (1p36.13). Schafer et al. were the first to document direct involvement of an error in proline metabolism in human disease in 1962.The affected family members had hyperprolinemia, cerebral dysfunction, renal anomalies, hereditary nephropathy, and deafness. Subsequently, many families with hyperprolinemia were reported in the literature. Several phenotypes of hyperprolinemia were identified, including those in some asymptomatic family members. Several authors have discussed the potential coincidental association between these clinical features and hyperprolinemia. Recently, our understanding of the associations between proline metabolism, biological function, and disease has increased dramatically. There are now at least six enzymes, three transporters, and seven structural genes known to be directly involved in the interconversions of proline and its immediate metabolites. The functional characteristics, tissue distribution, regulation, and subcellular location of these proteins have been determined, and, for some, structural information is available. The exact clinical features and the frequencies of HPI or HPII, however, remain unknown. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the incidence of HPI and HPII in Japan, and to evaluate the cases reported previously. In addition, we propose diagnostic criteria for hyperprolinemia and identify a need for future studies on this disorder. l-Proline metabolism Tissue and fluid concentrations of l-proline are primarily related to the balance between the enzymatic activities of POX and P5C reductase. In this context, P5C plays a pivotal role in maintaining the concentration of proline in body fluids. Inborn errors of proline metabolism can, therefore, result from a disturbance of P5C-associated enzyme activity. HPI and HPII are differentiated by distinct biochemical and genetic deficiencies in the proline catabolic pathway (Fig. 1). HPI is caused by a deficiency in POX, a mitochondrial inner-membrane enzyme that converts proline to P5C, the first step in the conversion of proline to glutamate. P5CDh, a mitochondrial matrix NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenase, catalyzes the second step of the proline degradation pathway. Deficiency of this enzyme is associated with HPII, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of P5C and proline (Fig. 1). Human disease in proline metabolism In human inborn errors of metabolism of l-proline, HPI, HPII, P5C synthetase deficiency, P5C reductase deficiency, ornithine aminotransferase deficiency and prolidase deficiency are known as single-gene disorders. The characteristics and molecular biology of these enzymes in humans are summarized in Table 1. Of these diseases, hyperprolinemia is seen only in HPI and HPII. Hyperprolinemia type I is diagnosed biochemically on high plasma proline without urinary excretion of P5C. In contrast, the presence of P5C in the urine is indicative of HPII. The clinical phenotype of HPI is not well characterized. Prior to the identification of PRODH, more than 15 families were reported in the literature with proline levels ranging from twofold to 10-fold above normal. Several phenotypes were found in these families. Whereas some patients were asymptomatic, others had neurological, renal and/or auditory defects. The potential for a coincidental association between these clinical features and HPI has been discussed. Hyperprolinemia has been reported in patients with a microdeletion in the 22q11 region. Since the identification of PRODH, various mutations of this enzyme (heterozygous and homozygous) have been identified in hyperprolinemic patients with different phenotypes (i.e. patients with schizophrenia, a 22q11 microdeletion and/or early neurological impairment). Jacquet et al. identified a complete homozygous deletion of PRODH located on chromosome 22q11 in a child with a severe form of HPI. That child had severe psychomotor delay and status epilepticus associated with a very high level of plasma proline (2246 μmol/L). These studies show, unambiguously, that the severe form of HPI, characterized by neurological manifestations, results from homozygous inactivating alterations of PRODH. The PRODH mutations were divided into three groups: those leading to mild (<30%); moderate (30–70%); and severe (>70%) reductions of POX activity. Serum proline level seems to correlate with the severity of POX deficiency. Higher serum proline was associated with lower IQ in patients with the 22q11 deletion (including the region of PRODH) syndrome. Recently, Guilmatre et al. also reported genotype/phenotype correlations in HPI. Hyperprolinemia type II is due to the absence of P5CDh activity. Valle et al. measured P5CDh activity in normal fibroblasts and fibroblasts from patients with HPII. The HPII fibroblast cells had no detectable P5CDh activity over a range of reaction conditions, whereas normal cells had easily measurable activity. This enzymatic defect accounts for the biochemical abnormalities in HPII, which is usually characterized by mental retardation and convulsions. Geraghty et al. surveyed ALDH4A1 from four affected members of a family with HPII. Four mutant alleles were found. A 1 bp deletion (G) at nucleotide 21 (A7fs(-1)) and a 1 bp insertion of a T following nucleotide 1563 (G521fs(+1)) cause a frameshift. The other two are missense mutations (S352L and P16L). To test the functional consequences of three of these mutations, they were expressed in a P5CDh-deficient strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to yeast expressing wild-type human P5CDh, yeast expressing S352L and G521fs(+1) failed to grow on proline and had no detectable P5CDh activity. Interestingly, the G521fs(+1) allele, segregated in the large Irish traveler pedigree reported by Flynn et al., was used to define the HPII phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the molecular basis for this inborn error. Hyperprolinemia type II was identified in a pedigree of Irish travelers (nomads), among whom consanguineous marriage and high fertility are common. Flynn et al. studied 312 subjects in 71 families closely related to a proband with HPII. Thirteen additional cases of HPII were discovered. A further 50 subjects were found to have mild hyperprolinemia. Flynn et al. found a strong association between HPII and seizures during childhood but no significant association with cognitive function. Most adults in this group with HPII enjoyed normal health. Some neuropsychiatric disorders appear to be related to hyperprolinemia. The prevalence of schizophrenia among patients with the 22q11 interstitial deletion associated with DiGeorge syndrome was high. This suggests the existence of a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia within the DiGeorge syndrome chromosomal region. This deletion was associated with hyperprolinemia in schizophrenia patients. In addition, two heterozygous mutations (L441P and L289M) in PRODH, identified in three of 63 patients with schizophrenia, but not in the 68 controls, were also associated with increased plasma proline. Bender et al. identified at least 16 missense mutations in PRODH in studies of HPI and schizophrenia, 10 of which were present at polymorphic frequencies. Although there is limited information on plasma proline level in the individuals with known PRODH genotype, extant data suggest that severe hyperprolinemia (>800 mol/L) and the most severe effect on function occurs in individuals with large deletions and/or missense mutations (L441P and R453C) in PRODH; modest hyperprolinemia (300–500 mol/L) is associated with PRODH alleles exhibiting a moderate reduction in POX activity. Interestingly, three of the four alleles associated with, or found in, schizophrenia (V427M, L441P, and R453C) resulted in a severe reduction of POX activity and hyperprolinemia. Proline oxidase functions are also related to tumor growth, hypoalimentation stress reaction, and fetal growth. Recent studies found that POX can regulate tumor growth both by tumor suppression and increasing tumor survival. Hyperprolinemia in Japan The present study investigated hyperprolinemia patients in Japan in 2009. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Life Science, Kumamoto University. A questionnaire was sent to the Departments of Pediatrics, Neonatology, Genetics, and Transplant surgery in 928 institutions in Japan. Institutions were asked to confirm that they had diagnosed and/or treated HPII. A secondary detailed questionnaire concerning HPII was then sent to those confirming institutions. We also examined previous patient reports on hyperprolinemia in Japan. Two reports of HPI and one report of HPII were identified and analyzed. According to the secondary questionnaire, the HPII patient was a 4-year-old boy. His parents were not consanguineous, and his brother died at 11 months of age due to sudden infant death syndrome. The HPII patient had no seizures and had normal development until 4 years of age, when he suddenly developed high fever progressing to generalized convulsions and unconsciousness. He was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with influenza encephalopathy. His blood proline was elevated (2767 μmol/L), while his blood ornithine was normal. Urinary P5C was detected. After treatment for encephalopathy, the patient recovered, although a high level of blood proline and urinary P5C excretion continued. He was then diagnosed with HPII. He currently is not undergoing any treatment, has no convulsions, his IQ score is 96, and his growth is within the normal range. Two cases of HPI have been reported in Japan; one in 1987 and one in 1991. The 1987 case was accompanied by chromosomal abnormality. This patient had below-normal activity of POX and hyperprolinemia, although no relation between blood proline level and clinical features was established.The 1991 case involved a 9-year-old girl who had photosensitive epilepsy. She had developmental delay and developed epilepsy at 7 years of age. Her blood proline level was three–fourfold higher than normal. P5C was not detected in the urine. POX activity in the liver was 23.5% of normal. A proline-restricted diet was not effective in preventing convulsions.Overall, details of these two cases are limited because the reports are more than 20 years old. Amino acids were analyzed in plasma samples from 200 severely handicapped patients living in a special institution in Kumamoto, as well as in plasma samples from 500 healthy individuals. None of the samples indicated hyperprolinemia, although some of the samples from normal individuals had plasma proline 2.5 SD higher than normal. Analysis of plasma proline in samples from elderly patients in a nursing home identified one case of suspected hyperprolinemia in a 90-year-old patient but, despite additional analysis, the patient was too old to confirm causality (data not shown). Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring amino acids in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper. Almost all amino acids can be analyzed by this method. In Korea, blood proline is analyzed as part of newborn screening, and four neonates were identified as having HPI. Similar newborn screening for proline is needed to determine the incidence of hyperprolinemia in Japan. Diagnostic criteria for HPI and HPII The exact clinical features of HPI are unclear. Nephropathy, uncontrolled seizures, mental retardation, or schizophrenia have been associated with HPI, but HPI without neurological manifestations is also known. The clinical features of HPII are similarly variable. Therefore, clinical signs and symptoms cannot be used to diagnose HPI or HPII. Patients who have uncontrolled seizures or developmental delay or encephalopathy of unknown origin should undergo blood amino acid analysis. When hyperprolinemia is identified, the patient may be diagnosed with HPI or HPII. A flow chart for the diagnosis of HPI and HPII is given in Figure 2. In HPI, blood proline is usually fivefold–10-fold higher than the normal range of 51–271 μmol/L. In HPII, blood proline is even higher than in HPI, usually exceeding 1500 μmol/L. Lactic acidosis can lead to secondary hyperprolinemia. Thus, any diagnosis of HPI or HPII must rule out lactic acidosis. If either HPI or HPII is suspected, analysis of urinary organic acids on gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy is useful. If P5C is detected in urinary samples, a diagnosis of HPII is confirmed. If P5C is not detected, the diagnosis is HPI. The activities of the different enzymes affected in HPI and HPII can be determined using cultured lymphocytes, peripheral leukocytes, or cultured fibroblast. Each affected gene has been cloned previously, and, therefore, gene analysis is also possible. Many of the mutations on these genes are described in the previous sections.",1971

26938218,"Introduction Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes as well as some cancers. Multiple studies have shown that weight loss achieved through energy restricted dietary interventions improves the metabolic dysfunctions involved in metabolic syndrome, and prevents type 2 diabetes. However, the capacity to lose weight and, in particular, to avoid weight regain, shows inter-individual variability that hitherto cannot be explained only by differences in exogenous environmental exposures and lifestyle factors. Several studies have shown that this heterogeneity is, at least in part, due to physiological/molecular metabolism differences. For example, overfeeding studies have demonstrated a threefold difference in energy efficiency, in turning calories into body mass between individuals. Still, the molecular mechanisms contributing to successful weight loss/maintenance remain poorly understood. Obesity and weight change are complex, and, in order to aid their comprehension, an integrated, multidisciplinary approach is necessary. Here, we show results from combining different types of “omics” data from a large dietary intervention study, with a network analysis approach, in order to elucidate the biological functions involved in the weight maintenance capacity in humans. Molecular phenotypes can be used as an intermediate to help in identifying relationships between genetic variants and a more global phenotype, such as weight maintenance. For instance, blood metabolite profile can be used to differentiate between obese and lean individuals. For example, plasma glycine levels were negatively correlated with BMI and associated with genetic variants within the carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1) gene, which encodes for a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate. These observations raise the possibility that alterations in plasma metabolite concentrations could reflect changes of metabolic processes involved in weight maintenance. The integration of experimental data with systems biology methods could point to possible not yet known pathways to explore. With this aim, the utilization of metabolite-protein and protein-protein interaction networks, built from databases, is a powerful way to investigate metabolic pathways potentially correlated with the condition of interest. Networks can allow the consideration of nodes and pathways that would not have been explored with other methodologies. For example, Emilsson et al. constructed an extensive co-expression network on the basis of the human adipose tissue data, to investigate key functional modules associated with obesity, and found that many of the interconnected genes were also associated with the inflammatory response and pathways linked to macrophage activation. In the present work we built a metabolite/protein interaction network of CPS1 and glycine, in order to investigate whether there could be a link between the pathways in which these are involved, and the complex nature of weight loss and regain, in combination with genetic, metabolomic, transcriptomic and anthropometric data. The presented results are based on data from one of the worldwide largest dietary intervention study, the Diet, Obesity, and Genes study (DioGenes). DioGenes is a multicenter, randomized controlled dietary intervention study, involving 8 European countries, which started in 2005. 938 eligible adults underwent an 8-week weight-loss phase following a complete meal replacement low calorie diet (800–1000 kcal/day total energy intake). Subjects who achieved at least 8% weight loss (n = 773) were randomly assigned to one of five weight maintenance arms for 26-weeks. In this paper we will refer as baseline (BL), the initial state (before the study), post-weight loss (PWL) the time after the 8 weeks weight loss period and (PWM) the time point after the 6 months weight maintenance phase. The DioGenes study is unique in its availability of multiple “omics” data from the different time points, including metabolomics, proteomics, adipose tissue RNA expression and genotype data on all participants. Results GWAS of glycine level Of the eighteen metabolites analyzed only two showed genome-wide significant associations with SNPs. We identified an association between rs2238732 in the PRODH gene and proline levels. The association of markers in the PRODH gene with proline levels has already been reported by Shin SY et al.. However, neither proline levels nor any of the SNPs in PRODH associated with measure of weight loss/weight maintenance and were not pursued further. We also confirmed the genome-wide association between polymorphisms upstream of CPS1 gene and blood-derived glycine level in 641 European individuals from the population based DioGenes study. These analyses have identified two loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5.0e-8) in CPS1: rs10206976 (chr 2:210749914 p-value = 4.709e-11, with allelic odds ratio (OR) = 1.23) and rs12613336 (chr 2:210704675 p-value = 1.368e-08, OR = 1.19) associated with the glycine level in the blood samples (Fig 1). The variant rs1047891 (chr2:210675783), causing the missense mutation Thr1412Asn, was identified as the most probable causal variant using a fine mapping approach. This variant was not in the SNP array used in our study, but is in LD with the SNPs rs10206976 (r = 0.51 D-prime = 1) and rs12613336 (r = 0.5128, D-prime = 0.923). CPS1 eQTL analysis The gene expression profiling from RNA-seq in adipose tissues at baseline for 450 individuals in the DioGenes cohorts were used to find genetic associations with the CPS1 transcription levels. Genetic mapping of the expression of CPS1 revealed significant eQTLs (adjusted p-value (FDR) < 0.05). Among those, 17 SNPs were defined as cis-eQTLs since they were located within 100 kbp from the transcription start site of the gene that was measured. Fig 2 shows the association between CPS1 transcription level and the SNP rs3856348 showing the strongest association (p-value = 2.477e-24). Using the LDlink a web-based application, one of these SNPs was found to be in linkage disequilibrium (D-prime > 0.6, R-squared = 0.101) with the glycine associated GWAS SNP rs1047891 (see Table 1). Glycine and CPS1 networks In order to explore the glycine and CPS1 connected pathways and to better understand the link between CPS1 and glycine at the molecular level, a database search was performed to identify protein–protein interactions for CPS1, and protein–metabolite interactions for glycine. Findings from these searches were converted into networks, where nodes represent proteins (or glycine), and edges represent protein–protein (or glycine-protein) interactions. The glycine-centered network resulted in 383 nodes and the CPS1—centered network in 77 nodes. The merged glycine and CPS1 network resulted in 427 nodes (33 shared nodes), shown in Fig 3. Gene functional enrichment for the 426 genes in the CPS1—glycine network for KEGG pathways showed enrichment for 22 terms (adjusted p-value (FDR) < 0.05), reported in S1 Fig. The top pathway for significance is the Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (adjusted p-value (FDR) 3.48 e-36). Interestingly, the One carbon pool by folate pathway is represented at the seventh place, with a p-value of 1.45 e-10. Weight maintenance and gene expression In order to investigate whether there was a relation between weight maintenance and CPS1 gene expression, the latter was investigated in successful WMs and WRs individuals. WMs were defined as subjects whose BMI did not vary more than 4% during the weight maintenance phase, while WRs were defined as subjects whose weight increased by more than 4%. CPS1 gene expression at the beginning of the weight maintenance phase was significantly different between the two groups (Fig 4, p-value = 0.04, correcting for age and sex). The same analysis was performed for all the genes in the CPS1-Glycine network, and the expression value of 45 genes (adjusted p-value (FDR) < 0.1) at the beginning of the weight maintenance phase was significantly different between WMs and WRs. The significant genes and corresponding p-values are reported in Table 2. Gene expression at the end of the weight maintenance phase of 426 genes within the CPS1-Glycine network was analyzed with respect to BMI variation between pre and post weight loss. In a multiple linear regression, the variation in expression of 10 genes was significantly (adjusted p-value (FDR) < 0.1) correlated with BMI variation during weight maintenance (Table 3).",1289
33608531,"Introduction Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases are highly prevalent in western countries. They use substantial health care resources, have a heavy societal economic burden, and impact the quality of life of those affected. GI disorders include peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GORD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and some of these disorders are commonly reported as correlated with each other. PUD, a common GI disorder, involves breaks (ulcers) in the inner lining of the digestive tract, usually located in the stomach or proximal duodenum. In GORD, the stomach contents leak back from the stomach into the esophagus. IBS is a chronic functional disorder of the GI system. Patients with IBS often manifest abdominal pain and altered bowel habit, with either predominantly diarrhea, constipation, or both. IBD includes Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which are chronic immune dysregulation disorders causing inflammation of the GI tract. PUD is a complex disorder, for which Helicobacter (H.) pylori infection and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the main risk factors. The development of infection-relevant PUD is recognized to be a multistep process, with contributions from both H. pylori infection and subsequent inflammation and damage of mucosa. Eradicating H. pylori is effective for infection-relevant PUD treatment. However, understanding the host factors influencing H. pylori infection and subsequent response could contribute to earlier risk identification and/or prevention, especially given the increasing antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Moreover, clinical presentation of PUD that is not associated with H. pylori infection, nor with the use of NSAIDs, are now also imposing substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Lifetime prevalence of PUD in the general population has been estimated to be about 5–10%. GORD is a multifactorial disorder and is more common in individuals with obesity and hiatal hernia. Lifetime risk estimates of GORD have a wide range (9–26%), with a sample size-weighted mean of 15%. An increase in the prevalence of GORD since 1995 has been reported. IBS, a common disorder with a population lifetime risk of 11% globally, is also likely a multifactorial disease, where hypervigilance of the central nervous system, immune activation of the intestinal mucosa, microbiome, prior infections, and diet are all suspected to play a role. IBD is associated with many lifestyle risk factors, particularly smoking, and lifetime risk for IBD is around 0.3% in most countries of Europe. The genetic contributions to PUD, GORD, IBS and IBD have been well-recognized, and well-powered genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified >200 approximately independent susceptibility loci associated with IBD. These loci implicate pathways such as autophagy and the IL-17/IL-23 axis and provide insights into IBD pathogenesis. IBD has been extensively studied through the GWAS paradigm but to a lesser extent for PUD, GORD, and IBS. Notably, the only GWAS to date for duodenal ulcer was in a Japanese ancestry cohort. Our primary focus was to identify genetic susceptibility factors for PUD by conducting a GWAS using data from the UK Biobank (UKB). Given the relationship between PUD and GORD (both acid-related disorders), the comorbidity of GORD and IBS and the much increased sample sizes afforded by the UKB, we also present GWAS results for GORD and IBS and investigate the shared genetic architecture between them. Inflammation of the gut is a key characteristic of IBD but not IBS, and hence differences between IBD and IBS from a genetic perspective are expected. Here, we take the opportunity to evaluate formally the genetic relationship between IBD and the more common disorders PUD, GORD, and IBS. Given increasing evidence for the importance of bidirectional signaling between the brain and the gut, possibly contributing to observational associations between depression and PUD, GORD, IBS, and IBD, we explore the potential causal relationships between major depression (MD) and the four disorders using Mendelian randomization (MR). Here, we identify eight independent and significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for PUD and the results highlight the role of host genetic susceptibility to infection, acid secretion, and gastric motility. We also identify a total of 11 independent and significant SNPs previously unreported for GORD and IBS. We show genetic similarity across PUD, GORD, and IBS and between these GI diseases with psychiatric disorders. Post-GWAS analyses find a link between PUD, GORD, and IBS with the nervous system. We find a significant relationship between PUD, GORD, IBS, and major depression through observational and MR analyses. Taken together, our results expand our understanding of the role of genetics in gastrointestinal diseases and add insights into relationships between these gastrointestinal diseases and their relationships with MD. Results The workflow for our study is given in Supplementary Fig. 1. Prevalence and comorbidity Based on disease-diagnosis (self-reported, hospital admission, primary care, and death register records) in the UKB, four case–control digestion disorder datasets were identified (Table 1), with prevalences for PUD, GORD, IBS and IBD of 3.7%, 12.0%, 6.5%, and 1.5%, respectively (Table 1). We note that the UKB prevalence rates are higher for IBD than the 0.3% aforementioned lifetime risk. This may reflect ascertainment biases or misdiagnosis within the UKB. Disease statistics (Table 1) and comorbidity analyses (Fig. 1) help describe the UKB phenotypes. The male/female odds ratio for being a PUD case is 1.66 while for IBS it is 0.42 (Table 1), consistent with PUD being more common in men and IBS more common in women. To allow readers to interpret the phenotype data that underpin our analyses, we describe in detail the disorder co-occurrences present in UKB participant records (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 1), which may reflect, in part, the natural course of the symptom presentations and/or misdiagnosis. For example, it is well recognized that IBD patients may have symptoms that provide a PUD or GORD diagnosis prior to, or as part of, the endoscopies that generate an IBD diagnosis and/or monitor the disease progress. Moreover, GORD can occur as a consequence of treatment of H. pylori for PUD as H. pylori infection can reduce gastric acidity. Here, while rates of PUD and IBD in those with GORD were significantly lower than the rate of GORD cases in the UKB as a whole, those with PUD or IBD were significantly more likely to also have GORD. For each of the PUD, GORD, IBS, and IBD (defined as the index disease), competitive comorbidity analyses tested, among the other three diseases, which disease is more prone to be comorbid with the index disease. We found that PUD is more prone to be comorbid with GORD while IBS is more likely to be comorbid with IBD (Fig. 1c). Full-sibling risk and heritability estimation Using SNP-based estimates of coefficients of genetic relationship between individuals in the UKB, we estimated the full-sibling relative risk for each of the PUD, GORD, IBS, and IBD and the heritability of liability, with the assumption that the increased risk in relatives only reflect shared genetic factors (Table 1 and Fig. 1d). The estimated heritabilities for PUD, GORD, IBS, and IBD were 0.28 (95% CI: 0.18–0.37), 0.28 (95% CI: 0.23–0.33), 0.12 (95% CI: 0.05–0.19), and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.36–0.64), respectively, all significantly different from zero. GWAS Genome-wide association analyses were conducted for five digestion phenotypes, the four disease-diagnosis traits (PUD, GORD, IBS, and IBD, see “Methods” section) and one trait that combined the disease-diagnosis and taking of corresponding medications and treatments (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). In clinical practice, medications for PUD also have a therapeutic effect on GORD, hence we generated the PG+M phenotype—a combination of disease-diagnosis of GORD and/or PUD and/or corresponding medications and treatments. We tested for association between 8,546,065 DNA variants and each of the five digestion phenotypes (PUD, GORD, PG+M, IBS, and IBD) in 456,327 UKB participants. A total of 66 within-trait (61 across-trait) independent variants were genome-wide significant (P < 5.0E−8) for the five digestion phenotypes analysed, of which 8 were associated with PUD, 6 with GORD, 19 with PG+M, 2 with IBS, and 31 with IBD. Two PUD-associated SNPs have been previously linked to PUD but in a Japanese cohort. For GORD, a recent GWAS study which used an earlier release of UKB data plus meta-analysis with other studies reported 25 genome-wide significant SNPs. Conditional analyses of our GORD and PG+M association results on SNPs previously reported as genome-wide significantly associated gastroesophageal reflux using GCTA-COJO found that three SNPs remain significant for GORD and six SNPs remain significant for PG+M. Given the aim of our study, Tables 2–3 list the 19 previously unreported genome-wide significant SNPs for PUD, GORD, PG+M, and IBS. SNPs associated with IBD are in Supplementary Table 3; we note that 28 of the 31 SNPs have been previously linked with inflammatory bowel diseases (despite concerns of the high prevalence of IBD in the UKB). The three GORD-associated SNPs and 13 PG+M-associated SNPs that have been reported are listed in Supplementary Table 4. The GERA cohort data were available as a replication sample for PUD (1004 cases, 60,843 controls) and IBS (3359 cases and 58,488 controls), albeit with limited power (~20% for each SNP, Supplementary Table 5). Six of the eight genome-wide significant SNPs for UKB PUD exist and one for UKB IBS in GERA and all have very similar effect size estimates as those in UKB, but only rs681343 was formally significant (P = 5.0E−4 < 0.05/8, a replication rate consistent with the power calculations) (Supplementary Table 5). Many of the PUD SNPs associations are previously unreported even when checking published results for any digestive diseases (Table 2). There are eight PUD-associated SNPs, which by physical distance (<22 kb) could implicate MUC1, MUC6, FUT2, PSCA, ABO, CDX2, GAST, and CCKBR, as annotated in Fig. 2. Pathway analysis using the GENE2FUNC of the FUMA pipeline showed that these genes are highly overexpressed in human stomach tissue. Detail on these PUD results are found in the discussion section. For IBS, a previous study of UKB data (earlier phenotype release) reported rs10512344 as the only SNP genome-wide significantly associated (P = 3.6E−8) with self-report IBS, and in females only. The P value for this SNP in our analyses is 5.0E−05 (P = 4.4E−07 in females, i.e., less associated than in the published study despite sample overlap). Given that they used a self-report phenotype while we used a combination of three resources, we regenerated three subgroup phenotypes (self-report only, hospital admission only, and primary care only) for IBS and repeated GWAS analyses for the three phenotypes and the results were used for further analyses (Supplementary Note 2). We also conducted similar subgroup phenotypes GWAS for GORD and PUD. Figure 2 shows Manhattan plots for PUD. Figure 3 shows Manhattan plots for GORD, PG+M, and IBS and Supplementary Fig. 2 shows Manhattan plots for IBD. Quantile–Quantile (Q–Q) plots of all the variants analysed in UKB are provided in Supplementary Fig. 3 for the five phenotypes. Regional visualization plots of the 66 independent variants are in Supplementary Figs. 4–8. Detailed pleiotropy results derived from the GWAS Catalog are provided in Supplementary Data 1. The 54 GTEx tissue specific enrichment results for eight genes in Fig. 2 are in Supplementary Data 2. In sensitivity analysis GWAS, phenotypes for each of PUD, GORD, IBS, and IBD were regenerated by excluding individuals with more than one GI diagnosis among these four disorders from the corresponding original phenotype cases (Supplementary Note 3). SNP-based heritabilities and genetic correlations We estimated the proportion of variance in trait liability attributable to genome-wide common SNPs (i.e., SNP-based heritability, ) using Linkage Disequilibrium Score regression (LDSC).  estimates on the liability scale were: PUD 0.06 (SE = 0.007), GORD 0.08 (SE = 0.004), PG+M 0.09 (SE = 0.003), IBS 0.06 (SE = 0.005), and IBD 0.11 (SE = 0.016) (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 6), all significantly different from zero. The SNP-based genetic correlation (rg) between PUD and GORD is 0.65 (SE = 0.05, P = 4.9E−36, phenotypic correlation (rp) = 0.11), similar to the rg estimate for GORD and IBS (0.65, SE = 0.05, P = 1.1E−46, rp = 0.10). The rg between PUD and IBS is 0.49 (SE = 0.08, P = 2.0E-10, rp = 0.03) (Supplementary Table 7), while the rg between IBD and each of PUD, GORD, PG+M, and IBS are not statistically significantly different from zero after Bonferroni correction (Fig. 4b). In sensitivity analyses, all individuals with more than one GI diagnosis were excluded (Supplementary Fig. 9a); the  estimates were lower but still significantly different from zero (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 9b), while the rg between PUD, GORD, and IBS remain significant (all rg > 0.25) and none showed statistically significant rg with IBD (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Fig. 9c1). Detailed results of sensitivity analyses are discussed in Supplementary Note 3 with the corresponding data presented in Supplementary Tables 6–7 and Supplementary Fig. 9. We also investigated  and rg for the three subgroup phenotypes (mentioned above) of each of PUD, GORD, and IBS, and found them to show significant  and high genetic correlation (see Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Tables 8–9). The rg between each of the five digestion phenotypes and the 258 traits from LD Hub plus nine psychiatric and neurological traits (Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Data 3, respectively) included 26, 37, 53, 16, and 3 significant correlations for PUD, GORD, PG+M, IBS, and IBD, respectively, after Bonferroni correction (P < 3.7E−5). Figure 4b, c show the rg between each of the five phenotypes and statistically significant correlations from the 267 traits. We summarize these results briefly. First, we observed significant positive rg between four digestion phenotypes (PUD, GORD, PG+M, and IBS) and depressive symptoms, major depression (MD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), neuroticism, and insomnia. However, there was no statistically significant rg between IBD and these traits. Second, PUD, GORD, and PG+M have significant positive rg with body mass index (BMI), body fat-related traits and coronary artery disease. GORD and PG+M are also genetically correlated with type 2 diabetes in a positive direction. Third, the common variant genetic architecture of PUD, GORD, PG+M, and IBS are positively correlated with educational attainment-related traits. In sensitivity analyses, all individuals with more than one GI diagnosis were excluded and the results are similar as above. Detailed results of sensitivity analysis are discussed in Supplementary Note 3 with the corresponding data presented in Supplementary Table 11, Supplementary Fig. 9, and Supplementary Data 4. Links to gene expression, eQTLs, and mQTLs We used partitioned SNP-based heritability analyses to determine if any genomic annotations showed enrichment of  relative to the null hypothesis that SNP-based heritability is partitioned proportional to the number of SNPs in an annotated set (see “Methods” section). After Bonferroni correction, GORD, PG+M, and IBS showed significant enrichment of  in conserved regions and  enrichment for IBD was in the super enhancer category (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 12). In analyses based on SNP annotations derived from cell-type histone-mark data (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 13), IBD showed significant  enrichment in immune and gastrointestinal cell-type groups, while GORD, PG+M, and IBS showed enrichment in the CNS cell-type. Based on cell-type specific SNP annotations derived from gene expression data of 205 different tissues (53 from GTEx and 152 from Franke lab), PG+M showed significantly enriched association with genes expressed in the hippocampus, frontal cortex (Brodmann Area, BA9) and anterior cingulate cortex (BA24) of the brain and IBD showed enriched associations in leukocytes (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 14). Given these significant results for GORD, PG+M, and IBS we conducted the same analyses using the fine-scale GTEx brain gene expression data which includes data from 13 brain regions (albeit smaller sample size). GWAS associations for PG+M were consistently enriched in the frontal cortex (BA9) (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 15). We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate if these results are mediated by educational attainment (EA), BMI, and smoking-related traits. The results remain significant after conditioning the PG+M GWAS results on the GWAS results of EA, BMI and smoking using mtCOJO (Supplementary Tables 13–15). We also investigated whether associations between SNPs and the five digestion phenotypes were consistent with mediation through gene expression using the Summary data-based Mendelian randomization method, SMR. SMR combines genome-wide significant SNP-gene expression associations (i.e., eQTLs) with the SNP-trait association results. Significant SMR associations provide the best statistical evidence given available data that the trait associated SNP could be a causal SNP through its action on gene expression. A total of five unique genes for which expression is significantly associated with three digestion phenotypes, including two genes for PUD (PSCA and FUT2), one gene for PG+M (SUOX), and one gene for IBD (RP11-129J12.2 and RPS23P10), were identified (Supplementary Table 16). The statistical framework of SMR can be applied to mQTL (genome-wide significant SNP-methylation association) data to identify putative methylation-trait association. Hence, we repeated SMR analyses for PUD using blood mQTL data from McRae et al.. Among the mQTL SMR results (Supplementary Table 17), three DNA methylation probes (cg01656853, cg08873673, and cg04660111), located in promoter region of FUT2, are associated with PUD (Supplementary Fig. 12). From Roadmap epigenomics annotation, there is a digestive tissue specific active enhancer for FUT2, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 12. Gene-based and gene-set enrichment analyses While individual SNP associations can implicate relevance of specific genes, given gene-specific genetic architectures putative roles of genes can also be identified by gene-based tests that combine the SNP-associations into genic annotations. We used MAGMA software to identify genes significantly (P < 2.7E−6) associated with each of the five digestion phenotypes, identifying: 29 for PUD, 112 for GORD, 157 for PG+M, 14 for IBS, and 97 for IBD (Supplementary Data 5). For gene-set enrichment analysis applied to gene-based summary statistics identified 11 gene ontology (GO) sets as significant for PG+M and six for IBD. The top enriched gene set for PG+M is “GO: POSTSYNAPSE” while that for IBD is “GO MHC CLASS II PROTEIN COMPLEX” (Supplementary Table 18). Comorbidity and MR with depression Given observational associations between depression and PUD, GORD, IBS, and IBD, we used the eight UKB depression phenotypes identified by Cai et al., together with our four digestion diagnoses, to test whether each of the 32 depression-digestion phenotypes pairs show significant lifetime comorbidity relationships. Cai et al. argued that some of the clinically derived depression phenotypes were more specific to major depressive disorder than self-report depression, and that biological interpretation should focus on analyses using clinically derived phenotypes. We were interested to know if the relationship between depression and common GI disorders depended on these different depression definitions. All eight depression phenotypes showed statistically significant comorbidity relationship with each of PUD, GORD, and IBS (Supplementary Tables 19, 20 and Fig. 6a). For IBD, the highest statistically significant ORs were for the more severe depression definitions of electronic medical record depression (ICD10Dep), DSM-V clinical guideline-defined major depressive disorder and recurrence (abbreviation: LifetimeMDD and MDDRecur) (Fig. 6a). Given the comorbidities of the digestion phenotypes with depression, we tested for statistical evidence of a putative causal association between MD and each of the five digestion phenotypes using Generalized Summary-data-based MR (GSMR); we also tested for reverse causality (Supplementary Table 21 and Supplementary Figs. 13, 14). For the relationship between MD and IBD, GSMR estimates were not statistically significant either in forward direction (the effect of MD on IBD) or the reverse direction (the effect of IBD on MD), despite being well-powered to identify associations. We found a unidirectional effect between MD and PUD, 1.20-fold risk for PUD per standard deviation (SD) in liability to MD. The reverse direction (PUD as exposure and MD as outcome) had a small point estimate and is not statistically significant, but we note that we relaxed the association significance threshold to obtain more PUD genetic instruments (8 SNPs to 13 SNPs). When we repeated the analyses (PUD as exposure and MD as outcome) using the eight genome-wide significant SNPs, the result remained statistically non-significant, suggesting that MD is putatively causal for PUD. This analysis should be revisited when GWAS sample size for PUD increases identifying more genome-wide significant SNP instruments. The effect of MD on GORD and IBS showed statistically significant estimates of 1.23-fold and 1.48-fold respectively increase per SD in liability to MD (Fig. 6b). The point estimates for the reverse causality analyses were smaller (but statistically significant), and again these analyses should be revisited in when more genome-wide significant SNPs are identified (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 21). We observed bidirectional statistically significant results between MD and PG+M, i.e., 1.27-fold increased risk for PG+M per SD) in liability to MD (P = 2.5E−15), and 1.26-fold increased risk for MD per SD in liability to PG+M (P = 2.7E−09). No SNPs were identified as outliers by the HEIDI test. The pattern of results was the same when other MR methods were applied, which, as expected, showed less significant results (see Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Table 22, and Supplementary Fig. 15). The bidirectional MR statistical significance between MD and PG+M could be consistent with reverse causality or pleiotropy. To exclude potential known confounders we repeated analyses with GWAS summary statistics conditioned on GWAS summary statistics of on EA, BMI, and smoking-related traits from mtCOJO analysis. The results remain significant in both directions (Supplementary Table 23). We used the latent causal variable (LCV) method, which is designed to better separate pleiotropy from causality. As expected, the genetic causality proportion is not significant for PG+M and MD because of the strong bidirectional significance (Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Table 24). As sensitivity analyses, we repeated the analyses after removing the depression cases from both cases and controls from the five GI disorder phenotypes (Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Tables 25–27). In summary, the statistically non-significant GSMR results in this study neither support a causal relationship from MD to IBD nor from IBD to MD. The results for PG+M do not support a unidirectional causal relationship given the significant bidirectional GSMR results. The MR results between MD and PUD, support a putative causal role of MD in PUD, but should be revisited when more SNP instruments are available. Out-of-sample polygenic score prediction To further investigate the relationship between MD and PG+M, we used MD GWAS summary statistics (European ancestry, excluding the UKB cohort) to generate MD polygenic scores and used these to predict PG+M risk in the UKB. We found that participants in the UKB with a high polygenic score for MD had a higher risk for PG+M-related disorders. The top decile of individuals ranked on polygenic risk prediction for MD had an OR of 1.33 (95% CI: 1.29–1.38) for PG+M risk compared to the bottom decile (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 28). We also selected genome-wide significant SNPs associated with PG+M in the UKB to calculate polygenic scores and predict depression and psychiatric disorder risk in GERA cohort, as shown in Fig. 6d respectively. Further, we selected genome-wide significant SNPs associated with PUD, IBS in the UKB to calculate polygenic scores and predict peptic ulcer and IBS risk in GERA cohort. The top decile of individuals ranked on polygenic score for PUD had an OR of 1.80 (95% CI: 1.38–2.36) for PUD risk compared to the bottom decile and that for IBS had an OR 1.42 (95% CI: 1.21–1.67) for IBS risk compared to bottom decile (Supplementary Fig. 16).",3724
31038731,"Disparities in precision medicine Health disparities exist in a wide range of diseases among minorities in the United States, with differences seen in prevalence, mortality, and responses to medications. These differences are multifactorial and include socioeconomic factors such as access to care, environmental stressors, adequate prescription drug coverage, and institutional racism. But along with these social and environmental factors, genetic variation also explains a portion of this variability. Pharmacogenomics has aimed to find the effect of genetic variations on drug response, with the goal of optimizing drug therapy and development. Taking advantage of the technological advances in genomics, a growing list of clinical biomarkers of drug response and adverse drug reactions have been identified. Although these pharmacogenomically relevant markers have improved our understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind drug treatments, these are often identified in patients of European ancestry and do not always replicate in other populations, as the allelic frequency, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and confounding environmental factors differ across populations. To date, most of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in people of European descent, resulting in an increased health disparity in precision medicine. A 2009 analysis on disparities in human genomics revealed that 96% of participants in GWAS were of European descent. Since then, the proportion of non-European individuals included in GWAS has increased to approximately 20%. Much of this increase is the result of studies conducted in populations of Asian ancestry, with relatively small increase in representation of African Americans, Hispanics or Native populations. In a recent scientometric review of GWAS, the authors found an explosion in the cohort sizes of GWAS, with all of the increase coming from very large European studies, albeit with a slight increase in diversity of the replication cohort, though this was again mostly in Asian populations. These reviews of ongoing GWAS efforts highlight the growing problem of diversity in genomics and the potential of missing critical population-specific SNPs that are important to the delivery of precision medicine to all. Inclusion of diverse populations in genomic studies is essential for evaluating the accuracy and wider relevance of findings that would help us understand the genetic heterogeneity in complex traits. In this review we will outline some of the advantages and confounders to the use of minority populations in genomics in general, the role of genetic variation in pharmacologic pathways and highlight some specific examples describing population-specific findings in pharmacogenomics. Potential confounders and advantages of genomics in minority populations Ancestry versus race Most studies of African Americans (usually referring to African Ancestry individuals in the continental US) used self-identified race as the criteria for inclusion in studies. While important social and cultural elements are encompassed by self-identified race, race is the sociological classification of human groups with shared biological characteristics. Ancestry, by comparison, can be ascertained by an individual’s genetic information. Human populations have migrated many times and mixed with other groups, potentially making the race of individuals differ from their genetic ancestry. Because ancestry varies in admixed populations, this additional source of variation may affect the association of SNPs to the phenotype of interest. Additionally, African ancestry group outside of the continental US use labels such as Black Brazilian, or Afro-Caribbean, as examples. These labels are also derived from a social context and distinct cultural traditions of this group. However, these labels do not always reflect the underlying genetic ancestry which may differ significantly from African Americans. An infamous example of the conflation of race and ancestry can be seen in the clinical trials related to heart failure, which is more prevalent in African Americans with difference in therapeutic response. Effort to capitalize on these differences led to the development of the drug BiDil (hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate). BiDil showed minimal benefit over enalapril in heart failure patients in general, but it was more effective in the subset of African Americans clinical trial participants. This led to the approval and marketing of BiDil as an African American-specific therapy. However, this finding became controversial as no effort to identify the mechanism behind it was reported. This study used race as a proxy for ancestry and hence lost the unique opportunity to discover if ancestry-specific variables (or SNPs) contributed to the difference in response. Interestingly, while more effective in African Americans, there were also white patients that benefited from this medication, suggesting a more complex story than the dichotomous therapeutic effect first reported. The problems related to ancestry versus race/ethnicity become even more complex in minority populations such as Hispanics as their genome is trichotomous, with ancestral contributions of indigenous American, European, and African ancestry. The proportion of genetic ancestry derived from each of these lineages varies substantially among and within each subgroup. As an example, Mexican Americans, are a subgroup of the US populations with origins in the country of Mexico. However, depending on whether their ancestors emigrated from European nations to Mexico or originated from the indigenous people of Mexico or a combination of the aforementioned geographical areas, there can be substantial differences in ancestry among Mexican Americans based on their ancestral origins and geographic locations within Central America. Similarly, Puerto Rican individuals may be comprised of European, Native American and African ancestries at varying amounts. However, population-based studies continue to lump Hispanics together, which negates the potential effect of these differing proportion of ancestry. Of note, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) has recently recommended standardization of ancestry groups reported in the pharmacogenomics literature to the following seven geographically defined groups: American, Central/South Asian, East Asian, European, Near Eastern, Oceanian, and Sub-Saharan African, and two admixed groups: African American/Afro-Caribbean and Latino. Efforts such as these will help to better communicate the populations in which pharmacogenomic discoveries are made. Concerted efforts to include ancestry proportions into genetic studies will help us to understand true population-based risk as well as the potential biological drivers, as seen in the recent work in Asthma response. This study identified population-specific associations to bronchodilator response in asthma that were linked to genetic regions of either African or European ancestry. These types of studies highlight that not only SNPs but the ancestral background of SNPs may affect their association to clinical phenotypes. It should be noted that most clinical pharmacogenetic laboratories do not use genome-wide arrays, hence limiting the ability to infer genetic ancestry in patients. Interestingly,, investigators have shown that the DMET Plus array (Illumina) distinguish the continental populations (Asian, African and Europeans) and provide an estimate of ancestry, but it’s ability to assess the ancestry of admixed population has not been shown. Discovery of new drug targets using minority populations One of the goals of pharmacogenomics is aimed to identifying genetic variation to improve drug discovery and development. Many diseases such as obesity, asthma and hypertension show differences of prevalence between populations that are multifactorial. The reasons for these health disparities are not fully understood; however, population-specific genetic variants may explain some of the potential drivers of disease and also uncover new drug targets. The best-known example of how population-specific genetic variation was leveraged into intelligent drug target identification was the discovery of PCSK9 in the regulation of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Nonfunctional variants of PCSK9 were associated with low circulating levels of LDL cholesterol. About 3% of African Americans were carriers of these variants and had approximately 88% reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease. These protein coding variants were carried at much lower frequencies in white populations. Thus, by leveraging the increased allele frequency of PCSK9 coding SNPs in African Americans, a new drug target was discovered. The identification of PCSK9 gene was only 15 years ago, however, it has been translated into an effective medical therapy in a relatively short period of time. This discovery has ushered in an exciting new era for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and drug treatments, highlighting how the use of a minority genome may benefit all populations. Potential to fine-map causative variants A unique aspect of genome biology in African ancestry populations is that they have considerably more genetic variation (i.e. SNPs), and lower extent of LD than European or Asian populations. LD is the nonrandom association of alleles at different loci within a chromosome and is the consequence of many factors, including population admixture, genetic drift, mutation, and natural selection. These differences in LD structure may result in the differences seen in GWAS findings between populations. This greater amount of genetic variation means that there are SNPs that are found in populations of African ancestry and therefore we would never be able to fully account for the contribution of these SNPs in genetic association by studying European populations alone. A study investigating the structure of genetic variation in major U.S. populations sequenced 3873 genes in 152 unrelated individuals from European (n = 40), Latino/Hispanic (n = 34), Asian (n = 38), and African American (n = 40) populations and observed that African Americans had the highest percentage of rare SNPs (64%), lowest percentage of common SNPs (36%) and most importantly, 45% of all SNPs in this population were unique. European genomes have extended LD blocks, and therefore when a genetic association is found, one can never be sure which SNP is the true causative allele. Because of the shorter blocks of LD seen in African Americans and hence fewer associated SNPs, investigators may be able to narrow down the region that harbors causative alleles. Also, marker SNPs that can be reliably predictive of pharmacogenomic phenotypes in Europeans will sometimes be poor predictors of the phenotypes in African Americans because the marker SNPs are poorly correlated with the true causal SNP in African populations. Additionally, the allele frequencies of SNPs vary across human ancestry groups. These differences may result in differences in statistical power to detect association of SNPs to clinical phenotypes. Genetic admixture results from the addition of a new genetic lineage into a population. The results of this is a genome which contains a mosaic of both populations. For admixed populations, such as African Americans, genetic ancestry can vary substantially among individuals, with the proportion of African ancestry ranging from 20% to nearly 100% in self-identified African Americans. However, at any specific loci the genetic ancestry can vary drastically, even between individuals that have relatively similar proportions of ancestry. This more fine-scaled ancestry is dubbed, local ancestry. Figure 1 illustrates these differences on a chromosomal level. Pharmacogenomics is still at the early stages of how these local ancestry differences affect association studies. However, it is becoming clear that accounting for both proportion of ancestry (also known as global ancestry) and local ancestry is necessary to accurately assess genetic association in admixed populations. Pharmacogenomics and minority populations The differences in allele frequency, LD structure and ancestry outlined above can be seen in findings across pharmacogenomics. These differences manifest as population-specific genetic associations, differences in drug response related to drug metabolism or enzymatic conversion, and adverse events susceptibility. It follows that these complexities result in population-specific considerations when assessing the impact of specific genetic variants on clinically relevant phenotypes. Perhaps more importantly, they highlight the inadequacy of a single variant (or set of variants) to be sufficient for the accurate prediction of drug response in all people. For example, rs7200749a missense variant for VKORC1 gene, is associated with increased warfarin dose requirement, and varies widely in frequency between populations. Hence, it can only be identified as associated with drug response in populations in which the allele frequency is high enough to achieve adequate statistical power. The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) that contains exome sequencing data on individuals from six different ancestral populations (African [n = 5203], South Asian [n = 8256], East Asian [n = 4327], Finnish [n = 3307], Non-Finnish European [n = 33,370], and admixed American/Latino [n = 5789]) showed that half of all the functional variants in drug-related genes are unique to only one of the six populations and only 0.1% of functional variants occur with an allele frequency ≥ 0.1% across all populations. Cross-population differences in drug response An FDA review of drug approvals between 2008 and 2013 found that approximately one-fifth of new drugs demonstrated some differences in exposure and/or response across ancestry groups. However, identification of the specific variants responsible for these differences require dedicated trials in diverse populations. Many of the SNPs influencing major drug metabolism pathways show striking population differences in allele frequency and enzyme activityTable 1 shows allele frequency differences between global populations for Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) level A actionable recommendations found in current medications. Pharmacogenomic investigations in the past few years have revealed substantial population-differences in the metabolism, efficacy and safety profiles of many clinically important drugs. It is important to note that most pharmacokinetic studies of drugs are conducted in European with little data available in other populations. Hence dosing recommendations are highly biased toward Eurocentric pharmacokinetics. A prime example of pharmacokinetic differences is tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used to prevent and treat allograft rejection. Polymorphisms in CYP3A5 have been associated with pharmacokinetic variability and response to the drug. The CYP3A5*3 allele (rs776746), which encodes truncated protein is found at a high frequency (94%) in individuals of European ancestry but at a much lower allele frequency (18%) in African Americans. This difference in allele frequency results in a functional CYP3A5 enzyme in a majority of African Americans, while most Europeans do not have a functional enzyme. A recent study of tacrolimus dosing in 50 African Americans showed that the CYP3A5*1 allele is associated with normal function (also referred to as expressers), sub-therapeutic concentrations, and higher dose requirements for tacrolimus compared to non-expressers, i.e. patients with a CYP3A5*3/*3 diplotype. Genetic variations in drug metabolizing enzymes, like SNPs and gene copy number variations (CNVs) are important determinants of drug response. A study on global and local differences in SNP profiles in 283 drug metabolizing enzymes and transporter genes across 62 ethnic groups showed that there is a positive selection on variation in genes encoding for drug metabolizing enzymes and that these genetic differences contribute to population heterogeneity in drug response. CYP2D6, contributing to the metabolism of about 25% of clinically used drugs is highly polymorphic with at least 100 SNPs and CNVs identified. There are large population differences in the frequencies of CYP2D6 alleles, among them the non-functional CYP2D6*3 (rs35742686), *4 (rs3892097), *5 (gene deletion), and *6 (rs5030655) alleles. Of the decreased function alleles, CYP2D6*10 (rs1065852) and *41 (rs28735595) are more common in Asians and Europeans, respectively, while CYP2D6*17 (rs28371706) and *29 (rs61736512) are found in people with African ancestry. CYP2D6 gene duplications CNVs (at least three copies) with the ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype are present in approximately 28% of North Africans, Ethiopians, and Arabs; 10% of Caucasians; 3% of African Americans; and 1% of Hispanics, Chinese, and Japanese. Therefore, drugs like codeine that are biotransformed by CYP2D6 to active metabolites can have a lack of efficacy in poor metabolizers and exaggerated effects in ultrarapid metabolizers. Clinical cases have described toxicity in newborns as a result of breast-feeding mothers taking codeine who are also ultrarapid metabolizers. This has resulted in changes to FDA labels of codeine-containing medications to highlight this risk. However, recent restrictions on using codeine in children have repercussions for treating Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), which disproportionally impacts African American children. Tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or β-blockers that undergo CYP2D6-mediated biotransformation to inactive metabolites may result in adverse effects in poor metabolizers and a lack of efficacy in ultrarapid metabolizers. These allele frequency differences may explain the observation that blacks require lower doses of tricyclic antidepressants than white patients to attain similar treatment response to major depression. CYP2C9 metabolizes over 20% of currently marketed drugs. CYP2C9 *2 (rs1799853) and *3 (rs1057910) are common in Caucasians, but less frequent in African Americans and East Asians, whereas CYP2C9*8 (rs7900194) and CYP2C9*11 (rs28371685) are found exclusively in people of African ancestry. The incorporation of CYP2C9*8 and CYP2C9*11 into genotyping panels has been shown to improve warfarin dose prediction in African Americans. Additionally, CYP2C19 metabolizes at least 10% of clinically used drugs including antiplatelet drug, clopidogrel, pain medications, and a number of SSRIs. Polymorphic expression of CYP2C19 influences the risk of bleeding as well as non-response as clopidogrel, which requires CYP2C19 mediated conversion to have a therapeutic effect. Previous studies have shown that the prevalence of nonfunctional alleles CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285) and CYP2C19*3 (rs4986893) and increased function allele CYP2C19*17 (rs12248560) vary by ancestry. The frequencies of the CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles are higher in Asian populations. The CYP2C19*17 allele, which is found in African ancestry populations (24%), was associated with an increased 1-year mortality rate and an increased risk of bleeding in African Americans. A recent study has shown that the proportion of African ancestry may be associated with the hepatic expression on CYP2C19. Even in genes as important as these, most GWAS of drug response have been conducted in European and Asian populations, leaving the effect of population-specific variants unknown. Warfarin pharmacogenomics in diverse populations Population-differences in drug dose requirement have been seen with the well-studied drug warfarin, used for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic events and venous thrombosis. Effective and therapeutic anticoagulation is difficult due to the dose requirements variability between patients. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 have been established as important contributors to warfarin dose variability for individuals of European or Asian descent, however, they do not fully explain the dose variability for individuals of African descent. Three main variants CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and VKORC1 −1639G>A (rs9923231) are typically used for estimating warfarin sensitivity. These variants have explained different proportions of the variability in warfarin dose in different populations, mostly due to allele frequency. The mean minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs9923231 for East Asian populations is 92% compared with 10% for African American populations indicating strong population differences in effect. A targeted study of African Americans uncovered a SNP (rs12777823) approximately 37Kb upstream of the CYP2C cluster that was associated with lower warfarin dose requirement in this population. Interestingly, this SNP, while present in other populations, was only associated to warfarin dose in African Americans. This difference in SNP association may be due to differences in LD structure. Figure 2 illustrates the LD structure differences between populations at this locus and the consequences on genetic associations. The following studies highlight novel discoveries that can be made, even in relatively small minority cohorts, by leveraging the genomics of non-Europeans. A study of an Indian population showed the risk allele frequency of CYP4F2*3 (rs2108622) was higher in north Indians (30%−44%), as compared with African American (12%), Caucasian (34%) and Hispanic (23%), suggesting higher warfarin doses requirement for stable anticoagulation. A GWAS using an extreme phenotype strategy in African Americans found a novel association between a genetic variant (rs7856096) in FPGS, a gene known to affect folate homeostasis, and lower warfarin dose requirements among African Americans. Again, this is a SNP that is only found in African ancestry individuals and hence would play no role in the dose requirements of other populations. Furthermore, a study on Iranians showed high frequencies of the APOE E3 allele (60%) in patients and lower dose requirement of warfarin. Additionally, a study by Duconge et. al. on Puerto Ricans described the no function variant, NQO1*2 (rs1800566), which was significantly associated with resistance to warfarin in this population. Bleeding is the most severe complication of warfarin therapy. Although effectiveness and safety are routinely monitored by the international normalized ratio (INR), most cases of fatal bleedings occur at a therapeutic INR. The frequency of bleeding from warfarin is 15%−20% per year, with life-threatening bleeds accounting for as much as 1%−3%. However, these values are based on studies conducted predominantly in patients of European origin and do not account for differences in responsiveness to warfarin across different ancestral groups. Patients of African descent are at significantly higher risk of major bleeding from warfarin which contributes to adverse clinical outcomes and heath disparities in anticoagulation therapy in this population. Warfarin associated bleeding is known to depend on several patient-related risk factors including demographics, clinical conditions and genetic variants. Previous studies reported polymorphisms in warfarin target enzyme, (VKORC1) and warfarin metabolizing enzyme (CYP2C9) associated with increased risk of bleeding from the drug. However, these commonly studied genetic variants are not predictive of warfarin-associated bleeding in African Americans. A recent GWAS specifically focused on African Americans identified 4 SNPs in LD (rs115112393, rs16871327, rs78132896, and rs114504854) associated with warfarin-related bleeding at INR < 4, and found within the regulatory region of the gene EPHA7. These variants were shown to effect transcription, and hence may play a role in the regulation of EPHA7 and platelet function. More importantly, these are found only in people of African ancestry and would not have been discovered in previous studies of European ancestry patients. Given the lack of comprehensive genomics studies in African Americans, this discovery, i.e. the identification of a novel gene related to vascular homeostasis, is highly impactful and an important step forward towards pharmacogenetics-guided anticoagulation therapy. Antihypertensive Pharmacogenomics in diverse populations Hypertension is the most common chronic condition with life-long medications. Antihypertensive therapy reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to stroke, heart failure and ischemic heart disease. African Americans have the highest prevalence of hypertension in the world, with age-adjusted prevalence of 44.9% in men and 46.1% in women respectively. Furthermore, hypertension has an earlier onset, greater severity, and higher rate of target organ damage, contributing to decreased longevity in African Americans as compared with European Americans. A study using data of the blood pressure lowering arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT-BPLA) showed clinically significant ancestral differences in blood pressure lowering response to both first- and second- line antihypertensive drugs. Patients of African ancestry were significantly less responsive to atenolol monotherapy compared to patients of European origin. In contrast, response to amlodipine monotherapy did not differ significantly between patients of European, African and South-Asian origin. Addition of a diuretic to atenolol had similar effect in all three populations. However, upon addition of perindopril to amlodipine monotherapy, patients with Africans ancestry had a lesser response and patients with South Asians ancestry had a greater blood pressure lowering response. African Americans are more sensitive to sodium intake and thus are more likely to present with increased blood pressure. A study by Tu et. al. showed that increase in aldosterone concentration and decrease in renin activity in plasma were associated with blood pressure in African Americans, which was not seen in European ancestry individuals. They also exhibit a significantly poor blood pressure lowering response to beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and ACE receptor blockers compared to European Americans. Genetic testing prior to drug prescription has great potential to advance personalized antihypertensive therapy and prevent drug-associated adverse events, though currently unavailable. It is recommended that the first-line antihypertensive drugs (a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretics) should be used differently between African-American and non-African American hypertensive individuals. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the most commonly prescribed thiazide diuretic and antihypertensive agent in the United States, has been associated with a series of adverse effects, including an increased risk of developing diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperuricemia. A GWAS investigating HCTZ-induced changes in uric acid identified five unique gene regions associated with HCTZ-induced uric acid elevations in African Americans (LUC7L2, COX18/ANKRD17, FTO, PADI4, and PARD3B), and one region associated with these elevations in Caucasians (GRIN3A). In another GWAS focused on hypertriglyceridemia, a known adverse effects of thiazide diuretics identified two SNPs, rs12279250 and rs4319515, located in the NELL1 gene, associated with change in fasting plasma triglycerides in African Americans, where each copy of the risk allele was associated with a 28 mg dl−1 increase in the change in triglycerides. NELL1 represses adipogenic differentiation, and the authors speculate that HCTZ modulates adipocyte differentiation through NELL1 leading to accumulation of plasma triglycerides in patients carrying the risk allele. These studies demonstrate that including diverse populations in genomic research can uncover novel mechanisms underlying drug effects and adverse events. Asthma pharmacogenomics in diverse populations Asthma is the most common chronic inflammatory disease of the airways among children, which is incurable but can be managed by the regular use of asthma-controlling medications. The prevalence of asthma shows population differences, with prevalence of 18.4% in Puerto Ricans, 13.0% in African Americans, 8.2% in Whites and 4.8% in Mexicans. The asthma death rate of Puerto Ricans and African Americans is four-fold higher compare to that of Mexican Americans. In addition, drug response to asthma therapies has marked population-differences. It has been demonstrated that Puerto Rican and African American children with asthma were significantly less responsive to albuterol than European American children, which also associated with increased mortality among African-American subjects. Although multiple socioeconomic and environmental factors are associated with such disparities in asthma, some of the differences may be due to variations in genetic susceptibility. A meta-analysis of GWAS of asthma in diverse populations, including individuals of European American, African American, and Latino/Hispanic ancestry, identified a new asthma susceptibility locus at PYHIN1 (rs1102000) in subjects of African descent but not in Latinos/Hispanic or European Americans (p = 3.9 ×10−9). A GWAS in 2 independent African ancestry populations identified 3 SNPs (rs10515807, rs6052761, rs1435879, mapped to the genes ADRA1B, PRNP, and DPP10 respectively) relevant to asthma and allergic disease, however, none of them were replicated in European ancestry studies. Again, the differences in LD and allele frequency may explain these contrasting findings. A whole-genome sequencing pharmacogenetics study identified genetic variants important for albuterol drug response in racially diverse children. In this study, the investigators found rs28450894 (located within NFKB1 and quantitative trait locus for SLC39A8), which is significantly associated with drug response, was predominantly found in African ancestry populations (8.8–28.7%), versus European populations (3.7–7.6%) and Puerto Ricans (6.2%), and Mexicans (1.5%). An admixture mapping meta-analysis of genetic ancestry identified a new locus at 18q21 that contributed to asthma susceptibility and therapies in Latinos as well as a recent paper that identified two novel loci in 8p23 and 8q24 specific to asthma risk in African populations. These novel loci found through admixture mapping and population-specific cohort may yield novel drug targets and biomarkers that may be useful if replicated, for patient stratification. The challenge of ancestry diversity in clinical pharmacology and therapeutics With the knowledge gained from the human genomics, researchers are learning how inherited variations in genes affect individual’s response to medications. These genetic differences can be used to predict the effective medications for a person and to help prevent ADRs. However, the lack of minority studies has limited the applicability of clinical recommendations that can be made from these discoveries in a diverse population such as the US. The lessons from the warfarin pharmacogenomics clinical trials speak to this issue. In 2013, the EU-PACT trial reported that the anticoagulation control was improved when drug dosing incorporated genetic factors to calculate a patient’s warfarin dose. Meanwhile, the COAG trial reported that the similar genotype guided dosing did not make a difference among patients. Of note, the COAG trial included African Americans while the EU-PACT was conducted in a European ancestry cohort. While the COAG trial showed no improvement in warfarin dosing in the genotype guided arm, it showed lower mean percentage of time in the therapeutic range (TTR) for INR in the genotype guided arm when restricted to only the African American participants. In both these trials, only SNPs found to associate with warfarin dose in European or Asian were used to calculate warfarin dose in the genotype guided arm. Thus, by excluding ancestry-specific SNPs, a real possibility exists for misclassification of African Americans as requiring a normal dose of drug, when they may in reality carry other SNPs that are highly relevant to drug dose. These trials highlight that a “comprehensive” SNP panel must recognize the difference in predictive SNPs between populations and eschew the impulse to use only the information gathered for in the largest discovery cohorts, which bias our implementation studies toward discoveries in Europeans. The main roadblock to the implementation of a more inclusive precision medicine is well-done large-scale studies such as those seen in whites. These types of studies provide the opportunity for replication of previous findings and, with larger cohort sizes, the ability to find SNPs with smaller effects sizes. Notable cohorts such as the TopMed and MESA have recently been made publicly available with a conscience effort to have a larger proportion of non-European participants (61.4% underrepresented minorities). New efforts have also begun. The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) began funding a group of five Transdisciplinary Collaborative Centers (TCC) focused on minority genomics, with the goal of incorporating underrepresented US minorities in precision medicine. One of these centers, ACCOuNT (African American Cardiovascular Pharmacogenetic Consortium), was tasked with the discovery of novel genetic variants in African-American related cardiovascular phenotypes and incorporation of African-American specific genetic variations into clinical recommendations that could be delivered back to patient and physicians at the point of care. These efforts along with larger national efforts, such as the All of Us, will start to provide the needed data to move the needle towards equality in precision medicine. Importantly, these initiatives have made good-faith efforts to engage minority communities and patient populations in study design and recruitment. These are important steps for minority populations that may be weary of both science and medicine. In addition, these interactions will also help future efforts by developing communication tools needed to engage these communities in research. Challenges continue in the ability of the scientific communities to adequately evaluate and analyze the genomes of non-European populations within studies. Many of the commercial arrays that are used to genotype participants were developed to capture common genetic variants in populations of European ancestry and enabled efficient imputation of variants from European-descent reference panels. Recent efforts within the human genomics community have identified almost 300,000,000 bp of sequence in the African ancestry genomes that were not represented in the human reference genome. This suggests that a more inclusive approach is needed to accurately map the human genome for all populations. The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology, Phase II (PAGE II) was initiated by the National Human Genome Research Institute to expand our understanding of complex trait loci in diverse ancestral populations. Towards this effort, the Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (MEGA) was designed to substantially increase variant coverage across multiple ethnicities that would improve fine-mapping and functional discovery of clinically relevant mutations and uncover novel, population-specific, disease associations. Genome-wide SNP panels have continued to improve their coverage of genetic variation in populations outside of Europe. This effort was specifically highlighted in the work of H3Africa and the Welcome Trust, which developed a pan-African genotyping array. However, most clinical laboratories do not use genome-wide panels and instead rely on targeted genotyping panels containing clinically relevant SNPs. These SNPs are selected due to their discovery and replication in the scientific literature and thus are biased toward SNPs discovered in European Ancestry subjects. This perpetuates the growing disparity in our ability to deliver pharmacogenomics to non-European populations. However, with these new efforts, more efficient methods on assessing the translatability of new findings is needed. The impracticality of a clinical trial for every new genetic variant discovered is obvious. Real-world innovative trial designs for implementation such as those seen in the U-PGx trial across Europe may be needed on a national level to better understand the benefits and potential risk of pharmacogenomics implementation. In conclusion, we have outlined the potential confounders that may result from the addition of admixed minority populations to genomics analysis. Many advantages remain, such as the discovery of population-specific SNPs, the ability to uncover novel biological mechanisms through the discovery of new genes within a biological or disease pathway, and the improvement in the prediction of clinical phenotypes in these understudied populations. Clearly, more work remains as new pharmacogenomics phenotypes are discovered. But with large national and international efforts, these discoveries may be more quickly translated into all populations.

30392061,"Introduction The appendix is commonly thought to be vestigial in humans (Cakmak et al.), although recent reports have indicated a putative role for the appendix in maintaining a healthy gut microbiota (Donaldson et al.). Regardless, inflammation of the appendix remains a major source of morbidity worldwide, particularly in developed countries. Acute appendicitis affects approximately 9% of Americans (Anderson et al.) and is one of the most common reasons for emergent abdominal surgery. It is more common in males than females (1.4:1) and occurs most commonly in the second to third decades of life (Anderson et al.; Körner et al.). Roughly 30% of affected patients present with advanced disease featuring an appendiceal perforation, resulting in prolonged hospitalization and higher rates of complications (Barrett et al.). Historically, appendiceal obstruction from fecaliths or lymphoid hyperplasia has been considered the underlying cause of appendicitis (Holcomb and Murphy). However, efforts to verify this theory experimentally have generally been unsuccessful, and pathologic reviews of appendectomy specimens have clearly shown that many or most cases of appendicitis occur in the absence of an obvious luminal obstruction (Carr; Singh and Mariadason; Chandrasegaram et al.). For this reason, others have proposed that appendicitis, like other inflammatory processes, results from both genetic and environmental risk factors (Arnbjörnsson and Bengmark; Ergul; Sadr Azodi et al.). For example, much evidence supports a role of lack of dietary fiber in the increased incidence of disease in developed nations (Adamidis et al.; Arnbjörnsson). Newer evidence has linked appendicitis with specific disturbances of the appendiceal microbiome (Zhong et al.; Swidsinski et al.), and this idea is supported by the fact that nonoperative therapy with antibiotics can successfully treat some patients with the disease (Minneci et al.). Overall, there is no consensus on the pathophysiology underlying appendicitis, which appears to represent a unique disease process distinct from inflammatory disorders elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract (Murphy et al.). The role of host genetics in predisposition to appendicitis is poorly understood, but the available evidence suggests that genetic factors contribute to susceptibility. For example, heritability estimates of appendicitis derived from linkage, complex segregation, and twin studies range between 27 and 56% (Basta et al.; Duffy et al.; Oldmeadow et al.). Recently, association was observed for a locus on 4q25 near PITX2 with appendicitis in Northern European adults (Kristjansson et al.). This association was not found in children, suggesting potentially different genetic mechanisms or effect sizes of genetic risk factors for appendicitis between children and adults. Other genetic variants that account for the heritability of appendicitis have yet to be discovered. Here, we report results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of appendectomy with the largest number of cases to date with independent replication. We follow up the association studies with an analysis of gene expression. Our results support the role of the 4q25 locus and PITX2 in risk for appendicitis, and we nominate additional risk genes for the follow-up study. Results A GWAS of appendectomy was conducted on 133,680 individuals. Participant demographics are shown in Table 1. Results of the GWAS are shown in the Manhattan plot in Fig. 1. No evidence of genomic inflation was detected (genomic inflation factor, λ, was 1.034; see quantile–quantile plot in Figure S1). One genome-wide significant locus was observed on chromosome 4q25 near PITX2 (lead SNP rs2129979, p value = 8.82 × 10−14, OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.07–1.13; Fig. 2; Table 2). Genetic association with similar effect size has recently been reported at this locus in a GWAS of Northern European adults (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.10–1.20) (Kristjansson et al.). Eight other loci reached suggestive significance (p value < 1 × 10−6; Table 2), including 15q24 (NEO1), 20q13 (RBM38, CTCFL), 3p21 (TRAIP), 4q25 (c4orf32), 11p15 (AP2A2), 12q21 (DUSP6), 1p13 (CD53), and 3p21 (RAD54L2) (Figure S2). The lead SNPs of seven of the nine loci identified in the GWAS were considered for replication testing in 666 individuals from the COHRA1 cohort. Note, neither lead SNPs nor surrogates in high LD were available for three of the nine loci due to low MAF. COHRA1 cohort demographics are listed in Table 1. Evidence of replication was observed for rs2129979 (p value = 0.0046), the lead SNP at the significant locus on 4q25 near PITX2, after adjustment for multiple testing. The direction of effect of the SNP in the replication sample (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.194–2.639) was the same as in the 23andMe sample. No other SNPs showed evidence of replication. Replication results are detailed in Table 2. A meta-analysis was conducted on the most significantly associated SNP (rs2129979) in the 23andMe GWAS across the 23andMe, COHRA1, Icelandic (OR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.09–1.19; p value = 3.5 × 10−9), and Dutch cohorts (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.07–1.32; p value = 0.0011) (Fig. 3). The direction of effect was consistent for all four groups. Statistically significant genetic heterogeneity at this locus was found using Cochran’s Q statistic (p value = 0.0336), indicating some between-cohort differences in the genetic effects of this locus. Consistent with most genetic associations for complex diseases, the associated SNPs near PITX2 and other suggestive loci observed in this GWAS are non-coding, and statistical evidence of association at these loci does not point to specific mechanisms through which they impact susceptibility to appendicitis. Non-coding variants, such as these, may regulate gene expression. Therefore, we investigated expression levels for a panel of candidates prioritized based on the GWAS results. Expression levels in a custom panel of 27 genes were measured in 75 appendix samples (11 uninflamed, 8 mildly inflamed, 38 severely inflamed, 18 perforated) by direct detection of RNA barcodes. The mean age of the children from whom the samples were collected was 10.9 (range 5–18 years). Of the 27 genes tested, four genes showed significant differential expression across categories of appendix inflammation or perforation using a nonparametric trend test: PITX2 (p value = 0.002), UBA7 (p value = 0.001), CD53 (p value = 0.001), and RHOA (p value = 0.003) (Fig. 4). Additionally, ten genes showed nominally significant (p value < 0.05) evidence of differential expression (ENPEP p value = 0.006; NEO1 p value = 0.023; GMPPB p value = 0.010; MST1 p value = 0.019; MON1A p value = 0.011; FAM212A p value = 0.006, AP2A2 p value = 0.019, KCNA3 p value = 0.036, RAD54L2 p value = 0.024, WDR6 p value = 0.013) (Figure S3). Moreover, the expression panel, overall, showed significant (p value < 6.6 × 10−12) enrichment of nominally or significantly differentially expressed genes (14 of 27), compared to what would be expected for this panel of genes by chance if there truly were no expression differences across the inflammation groups. Analyses using the Kruskal–Wallis test showed similar results to the trend test (Figures S4 and S5) and did not yield additional significant findings. PITX2, the gene closest to the most significant replicated GWAS signal (rs2129979), was among the genes showing differential gene expression. eQTLs and corresponding GWAS signals for each gene on the expression panel, and statistical results of expression analysis are listed in Table S1.",1101
27312935,"Introduction Both insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome are powerful risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Insulin resistance can be defined as the inability of insulin to stimulate glucose disposal, and when an insulin-resistant individual is unable to secrete sufficient insulin to overcome this defect, T2D develops. The metabolic syndrome comprises a number of risk factors which occur together more often than by chance alone. A joint scientific statement issued in 2009 by the World Health Organisation (WHO), International Diabetes Federation (IDF), American Heart Association (AHA) and National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) identified the metabolic syndrome as comprising hypertension, dyslipidaemia (raised triglyceride and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels), hyperglycaemia and central obesity. The prevalence of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome is increasing, particularly in developing countries and in younger populations with estimates of prevalence ranging from 20 to 40 % in different populations. While there are strong lifestyle determinants for the development of both insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, it is increasingly clear that an individual’s risk of developing insulin resistance and aspects of the metabolic syndrome are also determined by genetic factors. Early familial genetic studies provided strong evidence for a genetic basis for both insulin resistance and the individual components of the metabolic syndrome, and since then, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and, more recently, next-generation sequencing, have allowed for the identification of both common (defined by a minor allele frequency (MAF) >5 %) and rare (MAF < 0.5 %) genetic variants linked with these disease-associated traits. Associations of common genetic variation with a particular trait are generally defined with a genome-wide significance level of p < 5 × 10−8. The scope of this review is to summarise some of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies and meta-analyses performed in relation to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Common Genetic Variation in Insulin Resistance Since 2007, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 88 loci associated with risk of developing T2D. The vast majority of the loci related to T2D are primarily associated with insulin secretion and β-cell function with far fewer variants apparently influencing insulin resistance. There are a number of reasons for this, not the least that insulin resistance is strongly linked to obesity, and dissecting out the role of common genetic variation in insulin resistance in the absence of obesity has been problematic. There has also been a lack of large cohorts with reliable measures of insulin sensitivity. Indeed, many measures examine whole body insulin sensitivity and do not measure insulin sensitivity at a tissue/organ level. Table 1 lists the loci and nearby genes associated with insulin resistance identified by linkage analysis, candidate gene studies and GWAS. The GENESIS consortium is the only group to date that has published a GWAS of whole-body insulin sensitivity measured during hyperinsulinaemia (clamp/insulin suppression test) in a modest number of subjects (2764 with replication in an additional 2860 individuals) from four cohorts. The consortium found that variation in NAT2 was associated with insulin resistance although this did not reach formal genome-wide significance (rs1208 was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity with p = 9.81 × 10−7 after adjusting for BMI). The rs1208 loci was also associated with fasting glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol and with an increase in coronary heart disease risk. A functional relationship between NAT2 and insulin sensitivity was confirmed in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes where NAT1 knockdown (the mouse orthologue of human NAT2) decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and in a mouse NAT1 knockout model which showed decreased insulin sensitivity. NAT2 is involved in acetylation and influences sensitivity to certain drugs such as isoniazid, although the endogenous substrates remain to be defined (reviewed in). GWAS such as this are challenging to perform in large cohorts as the protocols involved in measuring whole-body insulin sensitivity are time-consuming, labour-intensive and, as such, expensive to perform. The hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp is considered the gold standard method for assessing insulin sensitivity (defined for these purposes as the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake) but it is a long protocol and complex to perform. Simpler measures of insulin sensitivity such as fasting insulin concentrations and leptin/adiponectin ratios are often used as a surrogate marker for insulin sensitivity. Fasting insulin and glucose levels can also be used to calculate the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). HOMA-IR is used as a measure of insulin resistance which has the advantage of being simple to obtain but is not directly comparable to the clamp measure. In an effort to identify new variants associated with insulin resistance, large-scale meta-analyses of GWAS have been performed using multiple cohorts which have measures of insulin sensitivity, processing and secretion. This approach has confirmed associations of many loci with specific glycaemic traits as well as identifying new loci. The Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) performed meta-analyses on GWAS from 21 cohorts of non-diabetic individuals including 46,186 individuals with measures of fasting glucose and 38,238 with measures of fasting insulin and HOMA-IR as an index of insulin resistance. Twenty-five SNPs were followed up in a further 76,558 individuals with this approach identifying 16 loci associated with fasting glucose and two with fasting insulin. This study confirmed loci near GCKR and a newly identified loci near IGF1 as being associated with insulin resistance with these findings being replicated in a further 14 cohorts comprising 29,084 non-diabetic individuals with detailed measures of fasting proinsulin, insulin secretion and sensitivity. This latter study has recently been expanded by Dimas and colleagues who examined the effect of 37 T2D risk loci on measures of insulin processing, secretion, sensitivity and clearance from up to 58,614 non-diabetic individuals with basal measures and 17,327 individuals with dynamic measures of glycaemic traits. They found that the risk loci could be subdivided into five clusters including one cluster with four loci, PPARγ, KLF14, IRS1 and GCKR, associated with insulin resistance. More recently, alternate approaches to identifying variants associated with insulin resistance have been developed. Manning and colleagues have developed a joint meta-analysis (JMA) approach to identify SNPs significantly associated with either fasting glucose and/or fasting insulin while both adjusting for BMI and allowing for interaction with BMI. This analysis method can increase the power to detect genetic associations where interaction with the environment is unknown. This approach identified six loci, including five new variants, as being associated with fasting insulin levels (IRS1, COBLL1-GRB14, PPP1R3B, PDGFC, UHRF1BP1 and LYPLAL1). Scott and colleagues used the Metabochip, a custom genotyping array containing 196,725 SNPs chosen due to their associations with a variety of cardiometabolic traits including type 2 diabetes, BMI and fasting glucose and large-scale meta-analyses of up to 133,010 individuals to identify 17 loci significantly associated with fasting insulin. These loci included those previously identified by Manning, genes which have previously been associated with other metabolic traits (TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO, RSPO3, ANKRD55-MAP3K1 and ARL15) and newly identified loci (HIP1, TET2, YSK4, PEPD and FAM13A). These loci have been used in two further studies to generate an insulin resistance genetic risk score to examine the relationship between variants associated with fasting insulin and an individual’s risk of developing insulin resistance and T2D [•, •]. Scott and colleagues generated an insulin resistance risk score from ten variants which were also specifically associated with lower HDL and higher triglycerides (IRS1, GRB14, ARL15, PPARG, PEPD, ANKRD55-MAP3K1, PDGFC, LYPLAL1, RSPO3 and FAM13A1) while Yaghootkar and colleagues selected 19 variants to generate their insulin resistance risk score. These studies found that the insulin resistance genetic risk score was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and lower BMI [•]. Yaghootkar and colleagues found that a cluster of 11 risk variants were associated with increased triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol along with a lower BMI, while individuals with 17 or more of these risk variants were slimmer but were at higher risk of developing T2D, coronary artery disease and hypertension compared with those individuals carrying nine or less of these insulin resistance risk variants [•]. Together, these studies highlight that insulin resistance is not always associated with obesity and can occur in the absence of a high BMI. Genetic Loci Associated with Insulin Resistance Many of the loci that have been identified as being associated with risk of developing insulin resistance harbour genes nearby that are good biological candidates for association with measures of insulin sensitivity. The PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) variant Pro12Ala was one of the first genetic variants to be identified as being reproducibly associated with a decreased risk of developing T2D. PPARγ is a nuclear receptor involved in the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid and energy metabolism, and PPARy agonists are currently used in T2D treatment. rs972283 near KLF14 (kruppel-like factor 14) was identified through large-scale association analysis of a European cohort associated with reduced insulin action, and KLF14 gene and protein expression have recently been shown to be significantly reduced in both adipose tissue and muscle from T2D patients. IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) is a key component of the insulin signalling pathway initiating the activation of PI3K in response to insulin. The C allele at rs2943641 adjacent to IRS1 was identified as being associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia in a European population. Functional studies showed that the risk allele was associated with both lower basal IRS1 protein levels and reduced PI3K-activity during insulin infusion indicating a causative role for the variant on disease risk. The SNP, rs2943650, near IRS1 has also been associated with a lower body fat percentage, increased triglycerides and insulin resistance, and lower HDL-cholesterol. GCKR (glucokinase regulator) encodes glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) which binds to, and inhibits the activity of glucokinase, a key enzyme in regulating hepatic glucose disposal and storage. Variants within the first intron of FTO were the first to be robustly linked with body mass index. Further studies found significant associations of the variants with obesity-related traits and also with fasting insulin and insulin sensitivity. Variants within TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2) show the strongest and most consistent association with risk of developing T2D of any gene variants identified so far. The risk variant has been associated with both impaired beta cell function and insulin resistance. Subsequent functional studies have focussed on the role of TCF7L2 in beta cell function. However, there is now increasing evidence for a role for TCF7L2 in insulin-dependent tissues. A variant in NAT2 (N-acetyltransferase 2) was recently found to be the top signal in four European cohorts of non-diabetic individuals who underwent genome-wide genotyping as well as a direct measure of insulin sensitivity. Functional analysis of the mouse orthologue, NAT1, demonstrated that NAT1 knockout mice had impaired insulin sensitivity in vivo. Two loci near TMEM163 (transmembrane protein 163) were found to be associated with both reduced plasma insulin and HOMA-IR in a GWAS of a cohort with Indian ancestry. IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) is similar to insulin in function and regulates growth and development. Low plasma levels of IGF-1 have previously been associated with a reduction in insulin sensitivity, and analysis of the rs35767 polymorphism indicates that carriers of the G allele have lower circulating levels of IGF-1 compared to A allele carriers. MC4R (melanocortin 4 receptor) was identified by GWAS of a UK cohort of Indian-Asian and European ancestry as being associated with both insulin resistance, as measured by HOMA-IR and waist circumference, with higher risk-allele frequencies being found in the Indian-Asian cohort. Variants within MC4R have also been associated with BMI. GWAS of an African-American cohort identified the SNP rs7077836 near TCERG1L (transcription elongation regulator 1-like) and rs17046216 in SC4MOL (sterol-C4-methyl oxidase-like) as being associated with both fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, a finding also replicated in a West African cohort. ARL15 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 15) belongs to a family of intracellular vesicle trafficking although its exact function is still unknown. Variants within ARL15 are associated with decreased adiponectin levels and nominally associated with risk of T2D, coronary heart disease and insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR. Adiponectin is an adipokine involved in improving insulin sensitivity (reviewed in). A recent study using a novel adiponectin receptor agonist suggests that activation of the adiponectin pathway directly improves insulin sensitivity. Some of the novel loci are of unknown function but others, such as PPP1R3B (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3B), are thought to play a role in skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis while GRB14 (growth factor receptor bound protein 14) interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases such as the insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors. Common Genetic Variation in Metabolic Syndrome The search for genetic determinants of the metabolic syndrome has largely taken two approaches, either examining the metabolic syndrome as a whole or as pairs of traits, or analysing associations with the individual components of the metabolic syndrome. Before GWAS, candidate gene association studies and linkage studies reported a number of potential genes associated with aspects of the metabolic syndrome but many of these findings were not replicated. Most GWAS to date have examined associations of variants with the individual components of the metabolic syndrome with at least 56 loci being reproducibly associated with obesity, 157 with lipids and over 90 loci associated with hypertension as well as the numerous loci associated with T2D (reviewed in). It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss GWAS associated with the individual metabolic syndrome components. Instead, we focus on summarizing GWAS involving the examination of the metabolic syndrome as an entity in itself. Table 2 summarizes the variants identified in such studies. The first GWAS examining common genetic variation in metabolic syndrome was performed on a population of Indian-Asian men who have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome compared to the European population. A total of approximately 317,000 SNPs were genotyped in 2700 individuals in stage 1 with the top 1500 SNPs followed up in 2300 individuals in stage 2. No common genetic basis for metabolic syndrome was identified in this study. GWAS of a European population examined the association of approximately 2.5 million SNPs with either metabolic syndrome as a whole, or with pairs of traits in 22,161 individuals. Variants near BUD13, ZNF259, APOA5, LPL and CETP were found to be associated with metabolic syndrome, and a further 27 variants were associated with combinations of pairs of traits. Avery and colleagues adopted a different approach to examining the metabolic syndrome involving the clustering of metabolic traits into six phenotype domains encompassing 19 quantitative traits. Using data from 19,486 European and 6287 African-American individuals, they identified three new loci associated with more than one phenotype domain, APOC1, BRAP and PLCG1 as well as confirming associations of variants near GCKR, ABCB11, LPL, HNF1A, FTO and SUGP1 with multiple phenotype domains. A study in four Finnish cohorts encompassing 11,616 individuals identified a SNP, rs964184, near the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster on chromosome 11 as being associated with metabolic syndrome confirming a strong lipid gene component to the genetics of the metabolic syndrome. Three GWAS studies have examined association of genetic variants in non-European populations. A study of 8842 Korean individuals identified two SNPs near BUD13 as reaching genome-wide significance with a further eight SNPs reported to be of nominal significance including previously reported variants near APOA5 and LPL. Metabochip genotype array analysis of an African-American population identified 27 SNPs associated with the metabolic syndrome; however, only one (APOC1) was associated with all five components of the metabolic syndrome. More recently, GWAS on a population of African ancestry identified variants near RALYL, KSR2, MBNL1 and two variants specific to the African population near CA10 and CTNNA3 as being associated with metabolic syndrome. While there is limited overlap between these GWAS, which may, at least in part, be due to slight differences in the definition of metabolic syndrome used, it is notable that many of the identified genes are associated with lipid traits. For example, variants near ZNF259, APOB, LPL, APOA5, CETP and GCKR have been previously shown to be associated with either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. Overall, these studies indicate that while there may be a strong lipid element to the genetics underlying the metabolic syndrome, there is no clear evidence at this point in time of one or more pathways linking the different aspects of the syndrome. In a different approach to identify if common metabolic pathways link the various components of the metabolic syndrome, data from 1193 twin men from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging with measures of adiposity (body mass index and waist circumference), blood pressure, insulin resistance (fasting insulin and glucose) and lipids (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides) were analysed. This study suggested that adiposity may be the underlying factor which links the other factors in the metabolic syndrome with findings indicating shared genetic influences between insulin resistance, lipids and adiposity and also between blood pressure and adiposity. Low-Frequency and Rare Variants Despite the increased success in identifying risk loci associated with insulin resistance and T2D, it has been estimated that these common variants account for only 25–44 % of the heritability of insulin resistance. The contribution of low-frequency (MAF ≤ 5 %) and rare variants (MAF ≤ 0.5 %) to the heritability of T2D and the metabolic syndrome remains to be explored. Exome sequencing, where all protein-coding genes in the genome are sequenced to document all genetic variation in these regions, has recently been employed in an effort to identify novel low-frequency variants that may have large effects on common metabolic phenotypes. Exome sequencing in a Danish cohort of 2000 individuals with a follow-up in a further 15,989 individuals revealed associations of two common SNPs within COBLL1 and MACF1 with T2D and a low-frequency variant in CD300LG with fasting HDL-cholesterol. While the biological function of the variants within COBLL1 and MACF1 is unknown, exploration of the functional effects of the risk variant rs72836561 at CD300LG revealed that this polymorphism is associated with reduced mRNA expression of CD300LG in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, decreased insulin sensitivity and increased intramyocellular lipid content suggesting a link between this variant and aspects of the metabolic syndrome. Exome sequencing in an Icelandic population revealed that a low-frequency variant in CCND2 reduces the risk of developing T2D but, counterintuitively, is also associated with higher body mass index. The 1000 Genomes Project was established to sequence, through a combination of both genome and exome sequencing, the genomes of 1092 individuals to aid identification of low-frequency and rare genetic variants across populations. These reference panels, containing 38 million SNPs, have been used by the European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology (ENGAGE) consortium to successfully impute the genotypes of low-frequency variants and perform 22 GWAS for BMI, waist-hip ratio, fasting glucose and fasting insulin. A meta-analysis of these imputed GWAS identified two novel loci for BMI and two novel loci for fasting glucose, of which one was female-specific. The investigators also identified new lead SNPs at 29 established genetic loci including rs1260326 near GCKR for fasting insulin. Another approach to identifying genetic variation associated with complex traits is to examine small populations which have been historically isolated. Such populations are often referred to as founder populations. Genotyping of 2733 individuals from the Greenlandic population using the Cardio-Metabochip followed by exome sequencing identified a common variant within TBC1D4 as being associated with higher fasting glucose and reduced insulin sensitivity. The effect of this p.Arg684Ter variant is to disrupt expression of the full-length TBC1D4 protein in skeletal muscle resulting in decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Individuals with familial partial lipodystrophy appear predisposed to features of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Familial partial lipodystrophy tends to be associated with functional mutations in the LMNA (lamin A/C) gene resulting in altered adipose tissue distribution. Genetic mutations, affecting either LMNA or the associated processing enzyme ZMPSTE24, have been shown to have a prevalence of 3 % in a small cohort of patients with metabolic syndrome raising the possibility that mutations in the LMNA gene may contribute, or predispose, an affected individual to the metabolic syndrome. Future approaches in identifying low-frequency and rare variants include the UK10K-cohort project which has combined whole-genome sequencing in a cohort of 3781 healthy individuals with exome sequencing of 6000 individuals with either rare disease, severe obesity or a neurodevelopmental disorder [•]. This project has uncovered 24 million novel genetic variants and resulted in the generation of reference panels with increased coverage of low-frequency and rare variants to help facilitate the identification and contribution of rare variants in health and disease.",3375
19133130,"Disease name and synonyms PFIC = Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis PFIC1 = Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 = Byler disease = FIC1 deficiency PFIC2 = Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 = Byler syndrome = BSEP deficiency PFIC3 = Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 = MDR3 deficiency Definition Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) refers to heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive liver disorders of childhood in which cholestasis of hepatocellular origin often presents in the neonatal period or first year of life and leads to death from liver failure at ages usually ranging from infancy to adolescence. Recent molecular and genetic studies have allowed the identification of genes responsible for three types of PFIC and have shown that they were related to mutations in hepatocellular transport system genes involved in bile formation (Figure 1). Epidemiology In our experience, PFIC represents 10 to 15% of causes of cholestasis in children and 10 to 15% of liver transplantation indications in children. PFIC1 and PFIC2 represent 2/3 of cases of PFIC, and PFIC3 1/3 of cases. The true incidence of PFIC is not precisely known, but PFIC is considered a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 births. All types of PFIC exist worldwide. Both sexes seem to be equally affected. Clinical description Main characteristics of PFIC 1–3 are summarized in Table 1. Cholestasis is a major clinical sign in all PFIC forms. It usually appears in the first months of life in patients with PFIC1, and is characterized by recurrent episodes of jaundice, which become permanent later in the course of the disease. In case of PFIC2, the initial presentation and the evolution seem to be more severe, with permanent jaundice from the first months of life and rapid appearance of liver failure within the first years of life. Early hepatocellular carcinoma (before one year of age) may complicate the course of PFIC2. Severe pruritus is usually observed in PFIC1 and PFIC2 patients. Phenotypic findings in PFIC1 and PFIC2 are similar, but some slight phenotypic difference have been identified. Extrahepatic features that have been reported in PFIC1 patients (persistent short stature, sensorineural deafness, watery diarrhea, pancreatitis, elevated sweat electrolyte concentration, liver steatosis), have not been described in PFIC2. In PFIC3, clinical signs of cholestasis are noted within the first year of life in about one third of patients and rarely in the neonatal period, in contrast to PFIC1 and 2. PFIC3 may also manifest later in infancy, in childhood or even in young adulthood. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension and cirrhosis is the presenting symptom in adolescent or young adult patients. Pruritus is usually mild. Evolution is characterized by chronic icteric or anicteric cholestasis, portal hypertension and liver failure. In half of the patient, liver transplantation is required at a mean age of 7.5 years. No liver tumor has yet been reported in association with PFIC3. Laboratory findings Patients with PFIC1 and PFIC2 have normal serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity, normal serum cholesterol level and very high serum bile acid concentration. Although PFIC1 and PFIC2 share similar laboratory findings, PFIC2 patients have higher transaminase and alpha-fetoprotein serum levels at diagnosis than those with PFIC1. Patients with PFIC3 have a persistent high serum GGT activity, normal serum cholesterol level and moderately raised concentrations of serum primary bile salts. Histological findings In PFIC1 patients, liver histology is characterized by canalicular cholestasis and the absence of true ductular proliferation with only periportal biliary metaplasia of hepatocytes. In PFIC2 patients, the same signs are seen but the liver architecture is more perturbed, with more pronounced lobular and portal fibrosis and inflammation. Hepatocellular necrosis and giant cell transformation is also much more pronounced in PFIC2 than in PFIC1 and may persist with time. These differences between PFIC1 and PFIC2 likely reflect the severe lobular injury present in PFIC2 (Figure 2A–B). In PFIC3, liver histology, obtained at the time of diagnosis (Figure 2C), shows portal fibrosis and true ductular proliferation with mixed inflammatory infiltrate. In a few instances, cholestasis is present in the lobule and in some ductules containing bile plugs. Slight giant transformation of hepatocytes can be observed. Cytokeratin immunostaining confirms the strong ductular proliferation within the portal tract. At a later stage (Figure 2D), there is extensive portal fibrosis and a typical picture of biliary cirrhosis. Interlobular bile ducts are seen in most portal tracts and there is neither periductal fibrosis nor biliary epithelium injury. Etiology PFIC 1 The first type, called PFIC1 (Byler disease) is caused by mutations in the ATP8B1 gene (also designated FIC1). This gene, which encodes a P-type ATPase, is located on human chromosome 18 and is also mutated in the milder phenotype, benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1) and in Greenland familial cholestasis. FIC1 protein is located on the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte but within the liver it is mainly expressed in cholangiocytes. The function of this P-type ATPase is unknown but it could be an aminophospholipid transporter responsible for maintaining the enrichment of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in comparison of the outer leaflet. The asymmetric distribution of lipids in the membrane bilayer plays a protective role against high bile salt concentrations in the canalicular lumen. How mutations in this protein cause cholestasis is unclear. It is postulated that abnormal protein function might indirectly disturb the biliary secretion of bile acids, explaining the low biliary bile acid concentration found in PFIC1 patients. Different studies have shown that impaired ATP8B1 function in patients with PFIC1 results in substantial down regulation of FXR, a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of bile acid metabolism with subsequent downregulation of BSEP in the liver and upregulation of bile acid synthesis, and of the apical sodium bile salt transporter (ASBT) in the intestine. All in all, these events lead to hepatocyte bile acid overload. Moreover, evidence for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) down regulation in cholangiocytes has also been reported in patients with PFIC1 which could contribute to impairment of bile secretion and explain some extrahepatic features. The ATP8B1 gene is expressed in various organs, including the liver, pancreas, kidney and small intestine, but is more highly expressed in the small intestine than in the liver. Therefore, it is thought to also be involved in the enterohepatic cycling of bile salts. This may also explain the chronic diarrhea present in a few children with PFIC1. Other extrahepatic features associated with PFIC1 such as persistent short stature, deafness and pancreatitis suggest a general cell biological function for FIC1. It is very likely that FIC1 disease represents a continuum with intermediate phenotypes between the benign phenotype BRIC1 and the severe phenotype PFIC1. So far, there is no clear explanation for the phenotypic difference between patients with BRIC1 and those with PFIC1. Mutation analyses suggest that mutations identified in patients with PFIC1 would severely disrupt protein function, whereas protein function would be only partially impaired in patients with BRIC1. Genotype-phenotype associations will probably be complicated because dramatic variability in phenotypic presentation has already been identified in patients with BRIC1 with a common mutation. In addition, many patients with FIC1 disease are compound heterozygous, which will also complicate the identification of genotype-phenotype correlations. Heterozygous ATP8B1 mutations have also been identified in some cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), that can be referred to under the term ICP type 1 (ICP1). PFIC 2 The second type, called PFIC2, is caused by mutations in the ABCB11 gene (also designated BSEP). Initially, PFIC2 was reported under the name Byler syndrome. The ABCB11 gene encodes the ATP-dependent canalicular bile salt export pump (BSEP) of human liver and is located on human chromosome 2. BSEP protein, expressed at the hepatocyte canalicular membrane, is the major exporter of primary bile acids against extreme concentration gradients. Mutations in this protein are responsible for the decreased biliary bile salt secretion described in affected patients, leading to decreased bile flow and accumulation of bile salts inside the hepatocyte with ongoing severe hepatocellular damage. BSEP deficiency represents also a phenotypic continuum between BRIC2 and PFIC2. So far, no clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been identified among PFIC2 patients, but most children with BSEP mutations, regardless of the mutation type, had no canalicular BSEP protein expression. Severe phenotypes are often associated with mutations leading to premature protein truncation or failure of protein production. Insertion, deletion, non sense and splicing mutations result in damaging effects and patients exhibited little or no detectable BSEP at the hepatocyte canaliculus. Missense mutations are also common defects that either affect protein processing and trafficking (i.e. p.E297G, p.D482G) or disrupt functional domains and protein structure. Thus detectable BSEP expression (i.e. p.N490D, p.G562D, p.R832C, p.A1110E) does not exclude functional BSEP deficiency. Some mutations have been functionally characterized confirming the defect of bile acid secretion. In milder disease, such as BRIC2, missense mutations predominate over those leading to failure of protein production and mutations occur in less conserved regions than in the NBFs (nucleotide binding fold) which contain the Walker A/B motifs and ABC signature. Cholelithiasis was also reported in BRIC2 patients [ and E. Jacquemin personal data]. Heterozygous ABCB11 mutations have also been identified in cases of ICP (ICP2), drug induced cholestasis and transient neonatal cholestasis. PFIC 3 The third type of PFIC, called PFIC3, is caused by a genetic defect in the ABCB4 gene (also designated MDR3) located on chromosome 7. Class III Multidrug Resistance (MDR3) P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is a phospholipid translocator involved in biliary phospholipid (phosphatidylcholine) excretion and is predominantly, if not exclusively, expressed in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte. Cholestasis results from the toxicity of bile in which detergent bile salts are not inactivated by phospholipids, leading to bile canaliculi and biliary epithelium injuries. The mechanism of liver damage in PFIC3 patients is likely related to the absence of biliary phospholipids. Injury to bile canaliculi and biliary epithelium results probably from continuous exposure to hydrophobic bile salts, the detergent effects of which are no longer countered by phospholipids, leading to cholangitis. In addition, the stability of mixed micelles in bile is determined by a three-phase system, in which a proper proportion of bile salts and phospholipids are necessary to maintain solubility of cholesterol. The absence of phospholipids in bile would be expected to destabilize micelles and promote lithogenicity of bile with crystallization of cholesterol, which could favor small bile duct obstruction. These cholangiopathy mechanisms fit well with the histologic findings such as ductular proliferation. PFIC3 represents an important example of canalicular transport defect that leads to the development of cholangiopathy. The phenotypic spectrum of PFIC3 ranges from neonatal cholestasis to cirrhosis in young adults. In our experience, ABCB4 sequence analysis in 50 PFIC3 patients revealed around 30 different ABCB4 mutations. Mutations were characterized on both alleles in most cases. In one third of cases, mutations gave rise to a truncated protein. When tested, no MDR3 P-glycoprotein could be detected by immunostaining in the liver of these patients. The absence of MDR3 protein can be explained in two ways. The truncated protein may be broken down very rapidly after synthesis giving rise to extremely low steady state levels of the protein. More likely, the premature stop codon may lead to instability and decay of the ABCB4 mRNA. This latter explanation is supported by the near absence of ABCB4 mRNA in northern blottings on liver samples from several patients. The remaining 2/3 of patients had missense mutations. Some of them were found in the highly conserved aminoacids sequences of the Walker A and B motifs which are involved in ATP-binding. Such aminoacid changes in the Walker A or B motif are generally not compatible with ATPase activity and transport processes. Alternatively, missense mutations might result in intracellular misprocessing of MDR3 as shown for other ABC transporters. Indeed, such missense mutations were associated with a decreased level of MDR3 canalicular protein. Whatever the mechanism involved, the low level of biliary phospholipids found in patients with missense mutations demonstrates the MDR3 functional defect. There is now strong evidence that in addition to PFIC3, an MDR3 defect can be involved in ICP (ICP3), cholesterol gallstone disease and drug induced cholestasis. A MDR3 defect is also likely to be involved in some cases of transient neonatal cholestasis and adult idiopathic cirrhosis. MDR3 deficiency may also represent a clinical continuum, as a single patient may experience different phenotypes during the disease course, starting with cholesterol cholelithiasis, then ICP and ending with biliary cirrhosis. Differential diagnosis Several other autosomal recessive PFIC-like diseases are known. Liver diseases resembling PFIC with normal GGT activity have been identified as inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis and represent distinct disorders. Other liver diseases resembling PFIC with normal serum GGT activity are recognized. Familial Amish hypercholanemia represents a PFIC-like disorder not due to a primary defect of the transport system involved in bile formation, but to a tight junction protein defect combined with a defect of primary bile acid conjugation. Cholestasis is due to impaired transport of unconjugated bile acids into bile and to bile leakage into plasma through abnormal canalicular tight junctions increasing paracellular permeability. Another category of progressive cholestastic liver disease of childhood could be due to abnormal villin expression, leading to loss of structural integrity of canalicular microvilli impairing biliary secretion system function. A case of hypercholanemia due to mutations in the m-epoxide hydrolase gene has also been reported (EPHX1). Arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction cholestasis syndrome is a complex disease due to mutation of VPS33B involved in intracellular trafficking and targeting of apical proteins. The gene defect results in a loss of apical protein expression in the liver and kidneys. From a liver point of view, it represents another PFIC-like disorder with normal GGT activity. In cases of high serum GGT activity, sclerosing cholangitis must be excluded. North American Indian Childhood Cirrhosis due to a defect in the cirrhin gene is characterized by high GGT activity as is Aagenes syndrome, a lymphedema cholestasis syndrome of unknown cause. Genetic counseling and antenatal diagnosis Genotyping should be used to confirm the diagnosis of PFIC in affected children. Heterozygosity of parents for the defects found in affected patients confirmed the recessive inheritance of the disease. This understanding has already allowed prenatal diagnosis. Antenatal diagnosis of PFIC requires clinical and biochemical expertise.",2367
22948894,"Introduction The liver plays an important role in the synthesis and secretion of bile acids, in the metabolism and transport of cholesterol, and in the metabolism and efflux of endogenous and exogenous substances by cytochrome P450 enzymes and phase II conjugation systems. Until the latter part of the twentieth century, it was generally assumed that passive diffusion, governed by the physicochemical properties of molecules, determines the uptake and efflux of drugs/metabolites across the basolateral and apical membranes of hepatocytes. However, it is now well established that transport proteins play a key role in the uptake clearance of many drugs from hepatic sinusoidal blood, and in the excretion of parent compounds and/or metabolites from the hepatocyte into bile, or the systemic circulation. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of hepatic basolateral and canalicular efflux proteins. For transporters involved in hepatic uptake processes, we refer the reader to the recently published review by Hagenbuch et al. Comprehensive reviews are referenced for details on specific efflux transport proteins. 1. Major Hepatic Efflux Transporters The hepatocyte is highly polarized with respect to transport systems expressed on the basolateral/sinusoidal or apical/canalicular membrane domain. Both membrane leaflets are separated by tight junctions that seal off the lumen of the bile canaliculi from the systemic circulation. The large pores (fenestrae) of the sinusoidal endothelial cells allow contact of the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and sinusoidal plasma. Basolateral uptake is the first step in hepatic clearance of compounds from the systemic circulation; this explains the high abundance of uptake transporters in the basolateral including the sodium-dependent taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs), organic anion transporters (OATs), and organic cation transporters (OCTs). In contrast, efflux transporters located in both the canalicular and basolateral membrane leaflets mediate excretion into bile or into the systemic circulation, respectively. (Figure 1) Apical/Canalicular Transporters Substances are excreted into bile primarily by ATP-dependent proteins of the ABC transporter superfamily [e.g., multidrug-resistance proteins (MDR), and the multidrug-resistance-associated proteins (MRPs)]. More recently, the multidrug and toxin extrusion exchanger 1 (MATE 1) has been identified as an apical efflux transporter for cations in hepatocytes. BSEP Bile salt export pump (BSEP) (ABCB11), a member of the ABC transporter superfamily, is located exclusively in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. BSEP has a narrow substrate spectrum and transports primarily monoanionic, conjugated bile acids. It exhibits high affinity for bile acids (taurochenodeoxycholate > taurocholate > taurodeoxycholate > tauroursodeoxycholate > glycocholate). Interestingly, only a few drugs have been described as BSEP substrates; pravastatin has been shown to be transported by both human and rat BSEP/Bsep, and vinblastine has been identified as a substrate of mouse Bsep. In humans, BSEP appears to be the sole transporter for monoanionic bile acids across the apical membrane; a decrease in BSEP function may lead to reduced bile acid secretion, enhanced intracellular accumulation of bile acids, cholestasis, and, in the worst case, progressive liver injury. Indeed, BSEP deficiency results in several genetic forms of cholestasis, such as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2) and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (BRIC2). In addition, this protein has been implicated in drug-induced cholestasis mediated by interactions between drugs and endogenous compounds, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.  P-glycoprotein (P-gp) P-glycoprotein (MDR1, ABCB1) was one of the first transporters recognized as having an important role in drug distribution and elimination. P-gp was first identified by Juliano and Ling in 1976 in Chinese hamster ovary cells that were selected for colchicine resistance, and that displayed resistance to a wide range of amphiphilic drugs. P-gp functions as an efflux pump for a wide range of substances including amphiphilic bulky cationic drugs, as well as for steroid hormones, hydrophobic peptides, and glycolipids. (see for review) P-gp is expressed in many biological interfaces, including the intestine, liver, the blood-brain and placental barriers, and the kidney, suggesting that this protein plays an important role in the distribution of xenobiotics and endogenous substances. In the liver, P-gp is expressed in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. However, hepatic P-gp expression levels are approximately sevenfold lower than in the intestine. Furthermore, high interindividual differences in expression levels (50-fold) have been reported. The relative contribution of hepatic P-gp to the overall disposition of substrate drugs in humans has been questioned. MRP2 MRP2 (ABCC2) is an organic anion transporter expressed in the apical membrane of polarized cells such as hepatocytes, renal cells, enterocytes and placental cells. It plays a key role in the biliary elimination of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and divalent bile acids. (reviewed in) MRP2 is involved in the biliary excretion of glutathione, which is a major osmolyte and a factor that determines bile-salt-independent bile flow.) MRP2 maintains a steep concentration gradient of GSH between blood and bile (GSH in bile = 10–15 mmol/l; GSH in blood = 100 μmol/l), thereby drawing water into the bile. This was supported by the observation that animals lacking functional MRP2 (e.g., TR or Esai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR) rats) exhibited a bile flow rate approximately twofold lower than that in control animals. ( As discussed below, MRP2 deficiency is associated with Dubin-Johnson-syndrome (DJS) and results in hyperbilirubinemia, due to impaired extrusion of bilirubin glucuronide into bile via MRP2. As a compensatory mechanism, upregulation of MRP3 increases transport of bilirubin glucuronide across the sinusoidal membrane.  BCRP The breast cancer resistance protein BCRP (ABCG2) was first described in multidrug-resistant cell lines, in which it was shown to confer resistance to cytotoxic compounds such as mitoxantrone, topotecan, irinotecan, and doxorubicin. Given its expression in blood-tissue barriers such as the blood-brain barrier, the intestine, and the placental barrier, BCRP is believed to have a major role in protecting physiologic barriers. Because of its broad substrate specificity, including specificity to anticancer agents and environmental carcinogens, BCRP has been associated with multidrug resistance and tumor development/progression. In the liver, BCRP is expressed in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Numerous studies have demonstrated the important role of BCRP in the biliary elimination of substrates. In Bcrp knockout mice, the biliary excretion rates of methotrexate, the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors pitavastatin and rosuvastatin, and fluoroquinolones were significantly lower than in wild-type mice, as published in a recent review.  MATE The discovery of MATE proteins explained how organic cations are excreted across the apical membrane in the liver and kidney. MATE proteins were identified originally as bacterial transporters. However, in 2005, two human MATE transporter proteins, MATE1 and MATE2, were identified on the basis of gene sequence similarity. In contrast to other canalicular drug efflux transporters, MATE proteins belong to the solute carrier family 47 (SLC47) and function as secondary transport systems that utilize the electrochemical gradient of cations across the membrane for substrate transport, which may occur in both directions. Human MATE proteins mediate the excretion of compounds into bile and urine on the basis of H+/organic cation antiport. MATE1 demonstrates predominant expression in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, but it can also be found in the kidney, skeletal muscle, adrenal gland, and testis. MATE2, on the other hand, is almost exclusively expressed in the luminal membrane of proximal renal tubular epithelial cells. Substrates of MATE proteins include the organic cations creatinine, guanidine, and thiamine, as well as numerous drugs such as metformin, cimetidine, oxaliplatin, acyclovir, and fexofenadine. In the liver, organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) may function in concert with MATE1 to mediate the hepatic uptake and biliary excretion, respectively, of cationic drugs and their metabolites.  Basolateral/sinusoidal transporters Basolateral efflux transporters mediate the removal of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds from the hepatocyte into sinusoidal blood. Transporters suggested to be involved in basolateral efflux processes include MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, and OSTα/β. MRP3 MRP3 (ABCC3), an organic anion transporter expressed in the liver, kidney, intestine, adrenals, and pancreas, is localized to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells. In the human liver, prominent MRP3 staining of cholangiocytes and weak staining of hepatocytes around the portal tract have been shown. However, hepatic MRP3 protein expression is highly variable (up to 85-fold) and highly inducible. For example, in humans, MRP3 expression is upregulated in the absence of functional MRP2, such as in patients with DJS, and under cholestatic conditions when the biliary excretion of organic anions via the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte is impaired. Originally, it was hypothesized that human MRP3 plays a role in hepatocellular bile acid homeostasis based on a report that rat Mrp3 transported conjugated bile acids with rather high affinity. However, it was later discovered that human MRP3 transports bile acids only with low affinity. The clinical relevance of human MRP3 as an important compensatory bile acid efflux pump remains to be established. In Mrp3 knockout mice, there was no evidence of the expected differences in serum bile acid concentrations and hepatic injury after bile duct ligation. However, because of a high affinity for glucuronide conjugates (e.g., morphine-3-glucuronide, bilirubin-glucuronide, etoposide-glucuronide, and acetaminophen-glucuronide), it has been suggested that MRP3 has a defense related function and contributes to the excretion of toxic anions. In this context, MRP3 may act as a switch to change the excretion route from bile to urine under pathological conditions. MRP4 MRP4 (ABCC4) is expressed widely in normal tissues and has been implicated in the transport of antiviral agents (e.g., azidothymidin, adefovir, and ganciclovir), anticancer agents (e.g. methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurin, and camptothecins) and cardiovascular agents (loop diuretics, thiazides, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists), as well as of endogenous substances such as steroid hormones, prostaglandins, bile acids, and the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP. Sulfated conjugates of bile acids and steroids have high affinity for MRP4. Although no specific disease has been linked directly to altered MRP4 activity, the sinusoidal expression of this protein in hepatocytes, its ability to transport bile acids, and its increased expression in human and rat livers under cholestatic conditions support the hypothesis that MRP4 is an important component of the protective system of hepatocytes. In support of this hypothesis – and in contrast to the findings in Mrp3 knockout mice – cholestasis induced by bile duct ligation in Mrp4 knockout mice resulted in increased liver toxicity as compared with bile-duct ligated wild-type mice.  MRP5 MRP5 (ABCC5), another member of the ABCC subfamily, is expressed primarily in the colon, liver, kidney and brain. In mice and humans, Mrp5/MRP5 is expressed at relatively low levels in healthy liver; however, MRP5 mRNA and protein are upregulated in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.. Currently, it is not known whether MRP5 participates in hepatic drug transport. OSTα/β OSTα/β was identified in 2001 as a novel organic solute and steroid transporter in the little skate Leucoraja erinacea; in 2003, mouse and human orthologs were identified and cloned. In vitro transfection experiments have shown that OSTα and OSTβ function as heteromeric proteins, and that c-expression of the two is required for delivery to the plasma membrane and functional activity. In human tissues, mRNA of OSTα and OSTβ is expressed widely; the highest expression levels are in tissues involved in steroid and bile acid homeostasis such as the small intestine, liver, colon, kidney, testes, ovaries, and adrenal gland. OSTα/β substrates include steroid hormones and endogenous compounds such as estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, bile acids, and PGE2, as well as the cardiac glycoside digoxin. Ballatori et al. showed that OSTα/β-mediated transport is bidirectional, ATP-independent, and unaffected by changes in transmembrane electrolyte concentrations and changes in pH gradients, suggesting that the transport takes place via facilitated diffusion. Depending on the extent of the electrochemical gradient, either efflux or uptake of substrates can take place. To date, no human disease has been associated with impaired OSTα/β function. However, the expression of this protein in organs involved in bile acid homeostasis, including the intestine and liver, suggests that this transporter might be involved in diseases associated with bile acid malabsorption or cholestasis. The participation of OSTα/β in bile acid transport in the intestine has been demonstrated in knockout animal models, but its role in bile acid disposition in the liver is less clear. 2. Efflux Transport Proteins as Underlying Factors for Disease The importance of hepatic efflux proteins in liver function is best exemplified by two diseases in humans, both of with associated with reduced/missing function of drug efflux carriers: PFIC and DJS. The elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms underlying these diseases, highlighted in the following section, played a key role in the early discovery and characterization of hepatic transport proteins and improved our understanding of the function of these proteins in the hepatic disposition of endogenous and exogenous substances. Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) Bile formation is a major function of the liver. After synthesis from cholesterol, bile acids are secreted via the biliary tree into the intestine, where they are involved in ingestion of fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. Along the small intestine, transport proteins facilitate bile acid reabsorption across the intestinal epithelial cells into the portal circulation and back to the liver. From the portal blood, bile acids are taken up into hepatocytes and the process of enterohepatic circulation is repeated. It is well established that hepatic bile acid secretion and enterohepatic circulation require the coordinated action of distinct uptake and efflux transporters on the apical and basolateral membranes of enterocytes and hepatocytes. Initially, the electrochemical gradient across the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte was thought to be the driving force for bile acid secretion into bile; however, this gradient was found to be insufficient to act as a driving force for the high concentrations of bile acids achieved in bile. The membrane potential across the canalicular lumen of approximately −35 mV would account for a gradient of only 1:3, whereas in vivo cell-to-bile acid concentration gradients of 1:10 to 1:100 are reached. In the early 1990s, studies in isolated membrane vesicles from rat and human liver demonstrated that canalicular bile acid transport is an ATP-dependent process. In 1995, a gene known as sister of P-gp (Spgp) was cloned by Childs et al. from a pig cDNA library using low stringency screening with a probe sequence from the multidrug-resistance gene MDR1. MDR1 and Spgp shared 61% amino acid identity. Tissue expression of the Spgp mRNA was detected almost exclusively in canalicular microvilli and in subcanalicular smooth membrane vesicles of rat liver, suggesting that it may be a candidate for ATP-dependent bile acid transport. Indeed, Gerloff et al. demonstrated bile acid transport in Xenopus leavis oocytes injected with rat Spgp, and in membrane vesicles from Sf9 cells transfected with rat Spgp cDNA. With these systems, it was shown that Spgp functions as an ATP-dependent bile acid transporter, and the protein was renamed the “bile salt export pump” (BSEP/Bsep). Human BSEP, the functional expression of which observed and characterized in 2002, also acts as a bile acid transporter. In the late 1990s, a link was identified between PFIC type 2 and BSEP mutations, and this disease was mapped to chromosome 2q24 where BSEP is encoded. PFIC is a very heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive liver disorders leading to intrahepatic cholestasis. On the basis of clinical, biochemical, and histological features, PFIC can be divided into three types that are associated with mutations in ATP8A1 (PFIC type 1), ABCB11 (PFIC type 2), and ABCB4 (PFIC type 3). The findings in patients with mutations in the ABCB11/BSEP gene are characterized by normal γ-glutamyltransferase activity, decreased biliary bile acid concentrations, and the absence of bile duct proliferation. The importance of BSEP function is highlighted by the fact that patients with PFIC type 2 secrete <1% of bile acids into bile as compared with normal individuals. These findings also suggest that there is no backup system for BSEP in the canalicular membrane. Without treatment, PFIC results in cirrhosis, which rapidly progresses to hepatic failure and often requires liver transplantation before the patient reaches adolescence. Several premature termination, missense, and frameshift mutations have been identified in patients with PFIC type 2; these mutations impair trafficking to the canalicular membrane and/or transport activity. (Figure 2) A recent study in BSEP patients demonstrated that the D482G mutation is associated with slower disease progression, consistent with data that the D482G BSEP protein retains some functional activity. Furthermore, these patients develop cirrhosis later in life and thus require liver transplantation later than other PFIC type 2 patients.. Dubin-Johnson Syndrome First described in 1954, DJS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by impaired secretion of organic anions such as bilirubin glucuronide, a black liver due to bilirubin accumulation, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in plasma. It had long been assumed that this syndrome was the result of a canalicular secretion defect; however, the underlying mechanism for this disorder was not identified until 1997, when a mutation in the ABCC2 gene was determined to be responsible for impaired expression and function of the multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2, Figure 3). One year earlier, Kartenbeck et al. had used an antibody directed against MRP1 (a protein related to MRP2) to demonstrate the absence of canalicular immunostaining in the liver section of a DJS patient. This antibody demonstrated lateral and canalicular staining in liver samples from healthy individuals, but only lateral staining in those from patients with DJS. Subsequently, it was determined that this antibody crossreacts with MRP2, detecting the apically localized MRP2 and as possibly the lateral/basolateral MRP1as well. The important discovery that loss-of-function of MRP2 is the mechanism underlying DJS was facilitated by the description and characterization of rat strains with inherited, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which resemble the findings in human DJS. The mutant TR-/GY (Groningen Yellow) Wistar rat strain was first identified by Jansen et al. A similar mutant strain, EHBR, was identified in Sprague-Dawley rats in 1986 in Japan by Mikami et al.) Both mutant rat strains are deficient in the canalicular transport of a variety of anionic conjugates such as bilirubin glucuronide, and glutathione and sulfate conjugates of endogenous and exogenous compounds. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that TR rats also exhibit low expression levels of Bcrp protein. ( Even before members of the ATP superfamily were cloned and functionally characterized, these mutant rat strains provided information on the functional capabilities of a postulated transport protein referred to as canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT), non-bile acid organic anion transporter, glutathione S-conjugate export pump, or leukotriene export pump. The biliary excretion of the radiolabeled glutathione S-conjugate of leukotriene C4 (LTC4), a compound later identified as a high-affinity MRP2 substrate, was significantly lower in TR- rats. Transport measurements carried out on inside-out canalicular membrane vesicles prepared from these mutant rat strains contributed further to our knowledge of substrate specificity. For example, ATP-dependent LTC4 transport was significantly impaired in canalicular membrane vesicles prepared from transport-deficient TR- rats.  The identification of the ABCC2 gene was facilitated by the prior identification of MRP1, which conferred multidrug-resistance in a lung cancer cell line; PCR, based on conserved domains of ABCC1, demonstrated a lack of amplification of a 347-bp fragment in TR- but not in normal Wistar rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, the sequence of the amplified fragment was MRP1-like but differed significantly from the cDNA encoding rat Mrp1, indicating the absence of an Abcc transporter isoform in this rat strain. Subsequently, in 1996, cloning and sequencing of rat Mrp2 revealed a nucleotide deletion in the Abcc2 gene of TR- rats. Human cDNA was cloned in the same year from a cisplatin-resistant cell line. Since then, ABCC2/Abcc2 proteins have been expressed and characterized in detail. The contribution of Mrp2 in the pathogenesis of the DJS-like phenotype in rats was confirmed by infecting EHBR rats with an adenovirus carrying ABCC2, which compensated for the genetic defect and corrected the canalicular transport deficiency.  3. Hepatic Efflux Transport Proteins as Determinants of Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy and Side Effects of Drugs Drug-induced enteropathy and diarrhea Biliary excretion is one route of elimination for many endogenous compounds such as bilirubin and hormones, as well as for some xenobiotics and their metabolites. Interestingly, in certain cases, the biliary excretion of drugs and/or metabolites may be responsible for injury to the small intestine (enteropathy) and diarrhea. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), irinotecan, and mycophenolic acid are examples of drugs associated with a high risk of drug-induced enteropathy and diarrhea. The role of hepatic efflux transporters in the adverse events associated with these drugs is discussed in the following section. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with gastric injury and are being recognized increasingly as a cause of enteropathy. Recent data using video capsule imaging studies demonstrated an incidence of intestinal damage of ~60% in subjects taking NSAIDs for a 2-week period. The gastric side effects of NSAIDs are well understood, but the pathophysiological mechanisms of enteropathy, characterized by inflammation and lesions in the small intestine, blood loss, increased permeability, and bile acid malabsorption, are far less clear. Most NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen, and indomethacin, undergo UGT-mediated biotransformation to form a reactive acyl glucuronide, which can then form adducts with proteins. This acyl glucuronide formation has been suggested to be the major toxicokinetic determinant. Drug conjugates are excreted into bile and move into the distal regions of the intestine, where they are deconjugated by bacterial glucuronidases, leading to high local concentrations of the parent compound. Several studies have suggested that intestinal colonization with different types of bacteria plays a significant role in the development of NSAID-associated enteropathy, and that the deconjugation capacity of bacteria might be an important factor in causing intestinal damage. Medications that influence the number and/or types of intestinal bacteria, such as antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors, might exacerbate NSAID-induced intestinal damage.  In the 1970s, biliary excretion and enterohepatic circulation were identified as important factors in the development of NSAID enteropathy; bile-duct ligation in rats prevented intestinal damage. This was substantiated by the observation that NSAIDs with limited enterohepatic circulation did not cause intestinal damage in animal models.) Further experiments in MRP2-deficient EHBR and TR rats demonstrated the key role of Mrp2 in the development of this side effect; rats deficient in Mrp2 exhibited lower levels of adduct formation and ulceration. ( Mrp2-deficient rats excreted 50% less indomethacin glucuronide and 98% less diclofenac glucuronide into bile as compared with wild-type rats. ) Transfer of diclofenac glucuronide-containing bile from diclofenac-treated wild-type rats into the intestine of TR rats significantly increased intestinal damage, demonstrating that biliary excretion is involved in the pathogenesis of small-intestine injury. ( Irinotecan, (CPT-11, Figure 4) a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, is used widely as an anticancer agent, particularly in the treatment of colorectal cancer, lung cancer and malignant melanoma. Clinical use of irinotecan is associated with myelotoxicity and dose-limiting severe diarrhea in 5–40% of patients. After administration by intravenous injection, irinotecan is hydrolyzed by hepatic carboxylesterases to the active SN-38 form, followed by inactivation by CYP-mediated oxidation or glucuronidation. Extensive amounts of irinotecan, SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G) are excreted into the bile and intestine via several ATP-binding cassette transporters, including P-gp, MRP2, and BCRP (Figure 4). In the human intestine, active SN-38 can be formed from irinotecan via intestinal carboxylesterases or by deconjugation of SN-38G by bacterial β-glucuronidases, and then reabsorbed resulting in a secondary peak in the systemic concentration-time profile. It has been hypothesized that repeated exposure of SN-38 to enterocytes by enterohepatic circulation is the cause of diarrhea. Numerous investigators have attempted to identify the environmental and genetic factors that affect the pharmacokinetic profile of SN-38 in an effort to predict side effects and individualize dosage regimens for patients. A major breakthrough in therapy was the evidence linking the low glucuronidation capacity of SN-38 to an increased risk of irinotecan-induced neutropenia. SN-38 is glucuronidated predominantly by UGT1A1. UGT1A1*28, which is characterized by seven TA repeats in the TATA element of UGT1A1 promoter (the wild-type genotype has six repeats), demonstrated lower expression levels and function and has been associated with irinotecan hemotoxicity. On the basis of these findings, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a label change for Camptosar® (irinotecan hydrochloride) to include recommended dosage adjustments for patients with the UGT1A1*28 allele.  Although there is strong evidence linking glucuronidation capacity with neutropenia, the association with diarrhea is less clear; approximately one half of irinotecan-treated patients with severe diarrhea have the UGT1A1*28 genotype. This suggests that there are other mechanisms, apart from UGT activity, that affect the pharmacokinetic and side effect profiles of irinotecan. The hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 has been shown to transport SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan; several clinical studies have highlighted the importance of this protein in the disposition of SN38. Furthermore, the drug efflux transporters P-gp, MRP2, and BCRP have been implicated in the disposition and toxicity of irinotecan, SN-38, and SN38G because of their involvement in biliary excretion. Two studies in patients with lung cancer demonstrated an association between the P-gp 3435TT genotype (which results in a lower plasma AUC for SN38G) and a higher incidence of diarrhea.  It has been suggested that functional variants in MRP2 (such as ABCC2 3972C>T) have profound effects on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity of irinotecan. De Jong et al. demonstrated that patients carrying the haplotype ABCC2*2 (low activity) exhibited a lower irinotecan clearance and less severe diarrhea if they did not carry the UGT1A1*28 allele, suggesting that MRP2 and glucuronidation play an important role in intestinal side effects. One hypothesis that could explain this observation is that the reduction in MRP2-mediated biliary excretion due to the ABCC2*2 haplotype leads to decreased intestinal formation of SN-38 locally. However, the presence of an UGT1A1*28 allele, and consequently the reduced detoxification and increased exposure to SN-38 in the enterocytes, could counteract this protection.  Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA), is a commonly used immunosuppressant for the prevention of transplant rejection. Like irinotecan, MMF therapy is associated with severe side effects including gastrointestinal complications and bone marrow suppression leading to dose reduction or drug discontinuation. After oral administration, MMF is hydrolyzed rapidly to the active MPA by esterases located in the gut wall, the liver, and the systemic circulation. In the liver, MPA is metabolized predominantly to the inactive MPA-phenyl-glucuronide (MPAG) and, to a lesser extent, to the active MPA-acyl-glucuronide (AcMPAG). Although the kidney is the major organ involved in MPA elimination, MPA-glucuronides undergo biliary excretion, intestinal deconjugation, and reabsorption as MPA resulting in a secondary peak in the MPA concentration-time profile, which contributes between 10 and 60% to the AUC of MPA. Although there does not appear to be an association between plasma AUC and diarrhea,) increased intestinal exposure to MPA due to biliary excretion of MPA glucuronides seems to be associated with the onset of diarrhea. Experiments in Mrp2-deficient EHBR and TR rats, and co-treatment with the MRP2 inhibitor cyclosporin A, demonstrated that MRP2 is the major transporter involved in the biliary excretion of MPAG and AcMPAG. ( These observations prompted a series of studies investigating the role of MRP2 polymorphisms in the development of diarrhea. The studies focused on the ABCC2 C-24T promoter variant, which has been associated with altered expression and activity of MRP2. To date, two studies – one in pediatric heart transplant patients and adult renal transplant patients reported a significantly higher incidence of diarrhea in patients expressing the ABCC2 C-24T promoter variant. However, three studies in patients after renal transplant failed to show this relationship. These controversial data suggest that other factors are involved in the development of intestinal injury during MPA therapy, including UGT-mediated glucuronidation and/or local bioactivation by the intestinal microflora. Drug-induced Liver Injury Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a serious adverse event that often results in the withdrawal of drugs from the market and is one of the leading causes for the failure of drug candidates in development. Although several mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of DILI including reactive metabolite formation, mitochondrial toxicity, and immunologic reactions, hepatobiliary transporters are postulated to be important contributors to the hepatotoxicity associated with some medications. In principle, either of two mechanisms may account for the involvement of transporters in the pathogenesis of DILI: (i) direct transport of potentially hepatotoxic compounds or metabolites, or (ii) interaction of drugs or metabolites with the excretion of potentially hepatotoxic bile acids. The hepatobiliary disposition of drugs and bile acids is governed by hepatic uptake, metabolism, and excretion. It has become increasingly clear that modifications in these processes, either by drug-drug interactions, disease states, or genetic variation, can greatly influence the disposition of potentially toxic endogenous and exogenous compounds. Currently, little information is available regarding the involvement of basolateral uptake transporters such as OATPs, OCTs, and OATs in the development of DILI. However, several drugs associated with DILI are substrates for these uptake transporters; therefore, enhanced expression or function of these uptake transporters might increase hepatocyte concentrations of hepatotoxic compounds. In contrast to the relative paucity of information relating to uptake transporters in the development of DILI, more information is available on the impact of efflux transporters, especially BSEP. As described above, BSEP primarily governs the biliary excretion of bile acids under normal physiologil conditions. Inherited dysfunction of BSEP leads to cholestatic syndromes (PFIC, BRIC) and cholestatic liver injury. Several drugs associated with DILI are potent inhibitors of BSEP, including cyclosporin A, bosentan, troglitazone, sulindac, rifamycin, and glibenclamide. The metabolites of a drug may also contribute to its hepatotoxic potential. For example, troglitazone sulfate exhibits 10-fold more potent inhibition of Bsep-mediated taurocholate transport than troglitazone in canalicular plasma membrane vesicles isolated from rat liver. Extensive hepatocellular accumulation of troglitazone sulfate due to impaired canalicular and/or basolateral efflux, may increase the susceptibility of some patients to liver injury mediated by troglitazone. The results of a recent study that screened 200 compounds for BSEP inhibition suggested a strong association between the pharmacologic interference of this transporter and liver toxicity (Figure 4). However, the low incidence of DILI suggests that other factors – genetic or environmental – are involved in the pathogenesis of DILI, predisposing some patients to develop this deleterious side effect. MRP3 and MRP4 are two basolateral proteins that are involved in bile acid efflux from hepatocytes, especially when biliary excretion is impaired. Studies in humans and bile duct-ligated rats have demonstrated that these transporters are upregulated under cholestatic conditions. The development of cholestatic liver injury after treatment with a BSEP inhibitor might be dependent on the expression and function of these basolateral efflux transporters that normally counteract increases in intracellular concentrations of potentially hepatotoxic bile acids. In addition to inhibition of bile acid transport, the hepatic disposition of toxic drugs and/or metabolites may be an underlying cause of liver injury. For example, patients with an MRP2 polymorphism associated with reduced function (C-24T) have a five- to sixfold higher risk of developing hepatotoxicity after taking diclofenac, probably due to increased intracellular accumulation of reactive metabolites and higher levels of toxic protein adducts. Trabectedin, a promising anticancer drug, exhibits dose-limiting hepatotoxicity. Mrp2 and other hepatic efflux proteins protect against trabectedin-mediated hepatotoxicity as shown in studies in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes. The importance of Cyp3a-generated metabolites in trabectedin hepatotoxicity, as well as the protection afforded by drug efflux proteins, was confirmed by studies in transporter knockout mice; only mild hepatotoxicity was observed in Cyp3a/Abcb1a/1b/Abcc2−/− mice in contrast to the severe toxicity seen in Abcb1a/1b/Abcc2−/− mice.  Statins HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as “statins”, are prescribed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease; statins are among the most widely used drugs worldwide. The major target of statins is inhibition of the hepatic synthesis of mevalonate, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Although statins are generally well tolerated, plasma-concentration dependent myopathy is a side effect characterized by muscle pain, fatigue, and cramping, which ranges from mild myalgia to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. High interindividual variability in plasma concentrations is a characteristic of statins; plasma concentrations and toxicity may be influenced by hepatic drug transporters. Expression of OATP1B1, an influx transporter localized on the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes, influences the pharmacokinetic profile as well as the myotoxicity of statins. Individuals expressing the c.521CC genotype exhibited higher plasma AUCs after administration of simvastatin, atorvastatin, and pitavastatin compared to those expressing the c.521TT genotype, probably due to decreased hepatic uptake of statins. Furthermore, the c.521T>C SNP has been associated with simvastatin-induced myopathy and a slight reduction in cholesterol-lowering efficacy (comprehensively reviewed in). Statins are also substrates of drug efflux transporters, including BCRP. Clinical implications have been reported in patients with the c.421C>A SNP, which reduces the transport function of BCRP. Subjects expressing at least one variant BCRP 421A allele were more likely to attain LDL cholesterol target concentrations after treatment with rosuvastatin. A plausible mechanism is decreased hepatic efflux, leading to higher intracellular concentrations and increased efficacy in patients carrying this variant genotype (Figure 5). However, BCRP also is expressed in the apical membrane of enterocytes where it limits the absorption of rosuvastatin from the small intestine. Carriers of the 421 allele also had higher AUCs and higher peak concentrations of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in plasma. These studies suggest that the greater efficacy of rosuvastatin in patients carrying the variant BCRP allele might be attributable to a combination of increased plasma rosuvastatin concentrations and increased hepatocyte exposure. Morphine, MRP3, and antinociception Morphine is a potent opiate analgesic that is used clinically to treat severe acute and chronic pain. A major obstacle in therapy is the development of drug tolerance, which necessitates dose increases and further elevates the risk of side effects. Furthermore, plasma concentrations of morphine and its metabolites vary considerably between patients, and it is necessary to titrate the dose according to the pain. In humans, morphine primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G; 60%) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G; 6–10%), which is mediated by UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 2B7 (UGT2B7); a large amount of the dose is excreted in urine, predominantly in the form of the glucuronide metabolites. In humans, M6G is the major active metabolite of morphine, and is more potent than the parent compound, while M3G has no analgesic properties and even antagonizes the effect of morphine. Compared to the parent compound, the glucuronide metabolites are more polar, which limits diffusion through membranes. Morphine-glucuronide conjugates must be transported into the systemic circulation by efflux proteins on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes; MRP3 has been suggested as a possible transport protein (Figure 5). Indeed, higher amounts of M3G were recovered in liver and bile of Mrp3 knockout mice; plasma M3G concentrations were reduced 50-fold, suggesting that Mrp3 is involved in the excretion of morphine-glucuronides from hepatocytes into the systemic circulation (M6G is not formed in mice). Human MRP3 also transports M6G, which may influence morphine disposition and analgesic potency. Recently, several MRP3 polymorphisms have been identified; however, these variant alleles had very low frequencies and displayed inter-ethnic variability. As mentioned previously, MRP3 expression in human liver is low, but quite variable (up to 80-fold). These differences in MRP3 expression and/or function may influence interindividual differences in morphine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.",5786
34289507," Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has reached a global prevalence of approximately 25% and comprises a disease spectrum in the absence of secondary causes such as consumption of relevant amounts of alcohol.      The spectrum ranges from isolated hepatic steatosis, defined as lipid droplets present in the cytoplasm of more than 5% of hepatocytes,  over progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in about one out of four patients with additional signature histopathological changes including hepatocyte ballooning and inflammation driving fibrogenesis, to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer (HCC).   Its close relationship with central obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia has contributed to the concept of NAFLD being the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome  and resulted in the recent proposal of an overarching description termed metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD).   This also reflects efforts to make a “positive” diagnosis similar to other liver diseases which does not rely on exclusion of other causes. In line with the metabolic association, several studies have found a strong correlation between MAFLD/NAFLD and cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as other extrahepatic metabolic manifestations. For instance, presence of hepatic steatosis has been found to increase the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus by approximately twofold and purports to be an independent driver for CVD additive to other risk factors.    Moreover, a significant association with CKD has been reported, persisting even after correcting for other known CKD risk factors.  Last but not least, NAFLD also significantly impairs quality of life, in particular including fatigue and even occurrence of pruritus,    a fact which may be underappreciated compared with liver disease of other etiology. Importantly, NAFLD/NASH has become a major cause of HCC and to date, the second leading cause for liver transplantation, further emphasizing the need for effective and sustained treatment options.        Recently elevated bile acid (BA) levels have received increasing attention as prognostic signature in NASH,     although the mechanisms underlying this observation are still poorly understood. In addition to their traditional perception as chemical detergents which facilitate dietary fat absorption, BAs have important signaling functions via their nuclear receptor Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and other G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., Takeda G-protein coupled receptor [TGR5]) on their own as well as lipid/glucose metabolism and inflammation.  The molecular alterations that occur in lipid metabolism of hepatocytes during NAFLD/NASH development are summarized in Fig. 1 (further reviewed in Arab et al  ). Given the central role of BAs and their receptors in controlling key aspects of NASH pathogenesis, modulation of BA-related pathways holds promise in therapeutically managing NASH.    This review provides a summary of the pathophysiological rationale and therapeutic opportunities of targeting FXR NASH.  Nuclear Receptor FXR as Central Mediator of BA Signaling in Regulation of Metabolism, Inflammation, and Fibrosis  In the liver, cholesterol from plasma or endogenous synthesis is enzymatically processed to primary BAs such as cholic acid (CA) or chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) which form glycine or taurine conjugates followed by active excretion at the canalicular membrane via bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11) into bile and storage in the gallbladder.  Upon food digestion, BAs are delivered after contraction of the gallbladder to the duodenum where one of their major functions entails micelle formation for facilitated absorption of fat-soluble substances (e.g., dietary lipids, fat soluble vitamins A, D, E). The majority of BAs (95%) is actively reabsorbed involving absorption through apical sodium-dependent BA transporter (ASBT/SLC10A2), transport across the enterocyte via ileal BA-binding protein (IBABP) and followed by basolateral excretion by organic solute transporter (OSTα/β) into portal blood. The remaining BAs are metabolized by resident gut microbiota in the colon resulting in deconjugation and dehydroxylation with formation of secondary BAs such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid which can then passively re-enter the enterohepatic circulation so that only a minor fraction of approximately 0.2–0.6 g/d (∼3–5% of daily synthesis) is lost in the feces.  To complete the enterohepatic cycle, BAs are very efficiently removed from portal blood at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes by Na + -taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP/SLC10A1) and organic-anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP/SLCO) family members.   In addition to its function as a facilitator of intestinal lipid absorption, bile is a major way of clearance for various exo- and endogenous substances. From their chemical structure, BAs are amphipathic detergents and therefore potentially cytotoxic, thus requiring a highly efficient molecular machinery to maintain intracellular BA concentrations in a nontoxic range. BA homeostasis is maintained through a negative feedback loop encompassing inhibition of BA uptake and synthesis as well as promotion of BA excretion and detoxification (reviewed in Hofmann  ). Toxicity from intracellular BAs involves induction of apoptosis, activation of proinflammatory pathways, and necrotic changes in a concentration-dependent manner.  BAs are able to directly induce an inflammatory signal in hepatocytes reflected by increased cytokine expression as well as upregulation of adhesion molecules.  In response to secretion of these proinflammatory mediators, immune cells such as neutrophils or macrophages are recruited and activated, further aggravating the inflammatory response in the liver.     Over the recent years, BAs in nontoxic concentrations have been shown to exert signaling functions for key metabolic and homeostatic processes such as self-regulation of BA metabolism, energy balance, and liver injury mechanisms including inflammation, fibrosis, apoptosis, and tumor development.     These regulatory properties of BAs derive from their intrinsic ability to act as ligands for a range of receptors including nuclear receptors FXR, constitutive androstane receptor, pregnane X receptor, and vitamin D receptor as well as membranous receptors TGR5, α5β1 integrin, epidermal growth factor receptor, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2.     Upon binding of BAs to FXR, the FXR–retinoid X receptor heterodimer complex is activated resulting in induction of the transcriptional repressor small heterodimer partner (SHP) which in turn downregulates the BA synthetic key enzymes cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1) and cytochrome P450 8B1 (CYP8B1) by inhibiting their transactivators liver receptor homolog-1 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, molecular changes which collectively result in repression of BA synthesis.  Apart from controlling BA synthesis, FXR activation also increases biliary BA excretion by upregulating expression of canalicular transporters BSEP as well as multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3/ABCB4) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G members 5 and 8 (ABCG5/G8) for accompanying phospholipid and cholesterol efflux, respectively.   Concurrently, FXR activation results in repression of the uptake system NTCP via induction of SHP.  In enterocytes, resorption of BAs leads to increased expression of FXR downstream targets including SHP, OSTα/β, fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and IBABP. Elevated levels of IBABP and OSTα/β result in higher transport efficiency and excretion of BAs into the portal venous system, while SHP directly downregulates ASBT expression thereby restricting intestinal BA reabsorption.   Furthermore, induction of intestinal FGF19 (Fgf15 in mice) leads to activation of hepatic fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)/β-Klotho downregulating CYP7A1 gene expression through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway.  Taken together, FXR functions as an intestinal and hepatic BA sensor and provides elaborate negative feedback and feedforward mechanisms to uphold physiological BA homeostasis while preventing toxic BA concentrations.   Apart from this regulatory function in BA homeostasis, FXR signaling is involved in lipid and glucose metabolism (reviewed in Chávez-Talavera et al  ). Mice deficient of FXR present with significantly increased serum and hepatic triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acid (FA) levels.  In line, upon administration of an FXR agonist, wild-type (WT) mice but not FXR-knockout (FXR-KO) mice exhibit decreased serum cholesterol, triglyceride, free FA, and lipoprotein levels.  Activation of FXR and subsequent upregulation of SHP result in repressing sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) which limits hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL).  FXR-dependent elimination of serum lipoproteins results from modulation of expression of target genes such as scavenger receptor B1, very low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, Syndecan-1, ApoCII/III as coactivators/inhibitors of lipoprotein lipase, and FA translocase (FAT/CD36).  On the other hand, FXR promotes β oxidation by activation of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα).  Correspondingly, FXR-mediated FGF15/19 signaling was shown to induce β oxidation in mitochondria  via reduction of malonyl-CoA by repression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC2). Regarding systemic effects, it has been shown that treatment with primary BA CDCA improves hypertriglyceridemia through an FXR- and SHP-dependent mechanism.   In line, disruption of BA reabsorption through use of BA sequestrants leads to increased biosynthesis of BAs from cholesterol thereby efficiently counteracting hypercholesterinemia.  Additionally, reduced plasma glucose levels and a trend toward lower HbA1c have been observed in cholestyramine-treated diabetic patients.  At the same time, a common adverse effect of resin treatment lies in aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, further underlining the role of BAs in triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism.  The signaling role of BAs in enterohepatic circulation with systemic metabolic effects of FXR is delineated in Fig. 2 .   Further studies investigating the role of FXR in glucose homeostasis showed that in line with its key role in BA and lipid metabolism, FXR-KO rodents exhibit features of hepatic and systemic insulin resistance as seen in increased fasting and fed glucose levels, decreased peripheral glucose disposal assessed by hyperinsulinemic clamp, and impaired gluconeogenesis.   Appertaining to this, insulin resistance in ob/ob and db/db but not KO mice could effectively be mitigated by feeding them with an FXR agonist such as CA/GW4064.  A potential mechanism by which FXR activation modulates glucose metabolism appears to be repression of key enzymes necessary for gluconeogenesis such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.  By triggering FGF15/19, activation of FXR stimulates glycogen synthesis and therefore decreased hepatic glucose output and plasma levels.   Furthermore, while activation of FXR in the terminal ileum inhibits glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) secretion through decreased expression of carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein and impaired glycolysis, BA signaling via TGR5 plays an important role in glucose homeostasis by inducing secretion of GLP-1 from enteroendocrine L-cells in the gastrointestinal tract, reflective of its therapeutic potential in NAFLD and obesity (reviewed in Chávez-Talavera et al  ). These potentially opposing effects might explain differential actions of BA-based therapies and FXR ligands in glucose homeostasis and need to be addressed in more mechanistic detail. In addition to its qualities as a controller of enterohepatic circulation, FXR plays a major role in modification of inflammation. Anti-inflammatory mechanisms of FXR can be attributed to stabilization of the nuclear corepressor NCoR leading to repression of nuclear factor kappa B and downstream inflammatory genes such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase 1.  INT767, a dual agonist for both FXR and TGR5, has been shown to improve liver histology and reduce proinflammatory cytokine expression in db/db mice as well as inducing a gene expression shift toward alternatively activated macrophages.    In addition to inflammation, FXR has important impact on fibrogenesis as another key step in the progression of NASH. Although FXR is not expressed to significant amounts in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), pharmacological activation of FXR was able to ameliorate thioacetamide-induced fibrosis and portal hypertension by counteracting inflammation and reconstitution of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity in sinusoidal endothelial cells.      Since inflammation drives activation of HSC and therefore hepatic fibrosis, administration of FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) may counteract fibrosis in rodents by blunting expression of proinflammatory cytokines in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells.  Furthermore, nonsteroidal FXR agonist PX20606 (precursor of clinically tested compound Cilofexor) ameliorated liver fibrosis and sinusoidal dysfunction in experimental models of noncirrhotic and cirrhotic portal hypertension.  Although these findings provide at least in part the mechanistic basis for clinical efficacy of FXR agonists in NASH fibrosis, the antifibrotic effects of OCA in recent clinical trials appear to be less pronounced (discussed below). Apart from obvious reasons such as species differences and variable duration of the fibrogenic insults, another possible explanation may be SUMOylation of FXR. This phenomenon leads to poor responsiveness to FXR agonist OCA, while upon co-treatment with SUMOylation inhibitors, the antifibrotic effect of FXR activation could be recovered via stabilizing of HSC lipid droplets by inducing Perilipin 1.    In addition to their pleiotropic effects on the liver, BAs undergoing enterohepatic circulation also affect the gut microbiome and vice versa. As such, BAs through their detergent properties act as antimicrobial agents by disrupting bacterial membrane integrity as well as by inducing genes involved in antibacterial defense through FXR, therefore inhibiting bacterial translocation.    For instance, treatment of bile duct-ligated mice with naturally occurring BAs or OCA led to improved intestinal barrier, intestinal inflammation, and decreased bacterial translocation.   Accordingly, in murine models of chemically induced colitis, FXR agonistic treatment led to reduced intestinal inflammation and improved epithelial membrane integrity.    On the other hand, microbiota metabolize BAs through introducing chemical modifications such as deconjugation and dehydroxylation, therefore altering their signaling properties. As such microbial generation of secondary BA isoDCA through modulation of intestinal FXR leads to increased differentiation of regulatory T cells, therefore underlining the notion of BA as immunomodulatory mediators.  Microbial processing of BAs not only involves activation but also inactivation of FXR.   For instance, in germ-free mice, accumulation of taurine-conjugated muricholic acid (Tα/βMCA) inhibits intestinal FXR and downstream Fgf15 expression.  In line, treatment of rodents with Tempol, which is an antioxidant reducing bile salt hydrolase activity, improves diet-induced obesity potentially through accumulation of intestinal TßMCA, similar to what is observed in intestine-specific FXR-deficiency models.  Mechanistically, intestinal inhibition of FXR leads to reduced biosynthesis of ceramides which have been linked to insulin resistance and inflammation in NASH.  Furthermore, ceramides induce lipogenesis through upregulation of SREBP1c and have therefore been implied as causal factors in NAFLD.  A direct comparison of germ-free and conventionally raised WT and FXR-KO mice revealed that diet-induced obesity and the accompanying systemic phenotype are promoted and transferable by gut microbiota through FXR signaling.  In line, in a study investigating gut microbiota of twins discordant for obesity, it was shown from transplantation of fecal microbiota to germ-free mice that lean twins had an FXR antagonistic microbial signature, supporting the concept of targeting the gut microbiome and intestinal FXR for treatment of NAFLD.   Changes in BA Homeostasis and Microcholestasis in NASH  Across their disease spectrum, patients with NAFLD exhibit alterations in BA homeostasis and their BA metabolome. A range of studies has revealed that serum BA concentrations are increased in NASH patients compared with healthy controls.     Higher serum BA concentrations in NASH were observed in both fasting and postprandial states.   The elevations of BA levels could be largely attributed to increased primary BAs and BA levels correlated with increasing NAFLD activity score (NAS) and fibrosis stage.  In line, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and CYP7A1 as markers of BA synthesis as well as serum BA levels correlated with disease severity in NASH patients.     In addition to serum BA levels, also their composition changes in NASH. More specifically, the ratio of conjugated to unconjugated BAs was elevated in NASH patients and an increased proportion of CA compared with CDCA could be detected which further contributes to mitigation of FXR signaling since CA is a weaker ligand than CDCA.   In line, gas–liquid chromatography of liver tissue from NASH patients revealed an increase in total BAs with CA and the ratio of trihydroxylated to dihydroxylated BAs being strongly correlated to inflammatory activity.    However, it is not clear whether these changes can be attributed to underlying metabolic changes (i.e., insulin resistance and obesity) rather than NASH per se.  For instance, insulin-resistant patients were shown to have a shift in BA profile toward 12α-hydroxylated BAs, which correlated with plasma triglyceride levels.  Moreover, comparison of obese patients either with biopsy-proven NASH or with healthy livers revealed that BA alterations in these patients are associated with concomitant insulin resistance but did not depend on presence of NASH.    The exact pathogenetic mechanism underlying these alterations of BA levels and composition in NASH patients still remains unclear and several options can be considered. In line with a mechanistic correlation to obesity and insulin resistance, multiple rodent models of diabetes exhibit altered BA metabolism (reviewed in Watkins and Sanders  ). As such, in streptozotocin-treated rats, decreased bile flow despite increased secretion of BAs together with increased BA levels in serum    support the concept that alterations of BA levels in NASH may reflect underlying insulin resistance rather than the associated severity of liver disease.    Paradoxically, FXR-FGF19 signaling—normally repressing BA synthesis—is impaired despite elevated BA levels, possibly reflective of underlying “FXR and/or FGF19 resistance” in NASH. Indeed, preclinical NASH models revealed partial resistance to FXR activation, reflected by transcriptional downregulation of SHP with consequent upregulation of CYP7A1.  Furthermore, as a reflection of impaired hepatic FXR activation, increased CYP7A1 expression could be observed in NASH patients while controversial results on BSEP and SHP expression have been reported.   NASH patients exhibit elevated cholesterol levels and increased activity of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) correlating with histologic features of NASH, integrating cholesterol levels to the concept of lipotoxicity.  In line, upregulated synthesis of free cholesterol may contribute to increased BA synthesis resulting from dysregulated FXR signaling.  In accordance with these findings, free FAs have been reported to repress FXR-induced SHP-signaling, therefore leading to increased BA synthesis and uptake potentially contributing to hepatocellular injury.  Similarly, expression of downstream target of intestinal FXR activation FGF19 is reduced in patients with NAFLD and NASH   and impaired hepatic repression of BA synthesis in insulin-resistant patients was observed.  This inverse relationship was correlated with severity of liver histology in NAFLD patients, therefore highlighting the potential of serum FGF19 levels as a biomarker for NAFLD.  Hepatic FXR activation can in part be assessed by measuring C4, an intermediate step in BA synthesis from cholesterol. As such, C4 is robustly elevated in NAFLD patients, supporting the notion of increased BA synthesis due to lower FXR activity.   In line, increased C4 levels have been associated with fibrosis score in NASH.    Moreover, changes in BA levels and composition may also reflect intestinal dysbiosis in NASH. Human fecal analyses revealed increased levels of CA, CDCA, and total BA in stool of NASH patients compared with healthy controls.  Furthermore, the obesity-induced BA and gut microbial metabolite DCA have been found to induce a senescence-associated secretory phenotype in HSC thereby facilitating development of liver cancer.  Changes in blood microbiota profiles as a reflection of dysbiosis and decreased ratios of secondary to primary BAs in serum suggesting an impaired ability to convert primary BAs have been reported to correlate with fibrosis in obese patients.    In addition to increased BA synthesis and altered intestinal/microbial BA metabolism, impaired excretion of BAs and other biliary constituents may contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD, consistent with the concept of (micro)cholestasis in NASH. Mechanistically, biliary BA excretion can be characterized by determining bile flow and intrahepatic canalicular bile pressure. Biliary pressure constitutes a hydrostatic force which was shown to disrupt bile canaliculi integrity, therefore contributing to hepatocyte necrosis and bile infarcts.  In addition, mechanosensing in the bile canaliculi network either directly through pressure sensors localized on cholangiocytic primary cilia or indirectly through biliary hydrostatic pressure opposing the osmotic gradient has been proposed as a mechanism to induce a Ca 2+ and cAMP-dependent signaling response leading to adaptative changes in the ductular network.   Albeit cholestasis not generally considered a feature of NASH, elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels—which have thus far been largely attributed to oxidative stress—in concert with elevated BA levels and altered BA composition point to the fact that there may be a cholestatic component in the pathogenesis of NASH. Impaired BA excretion and transport could result in altered signaling as well as accumulation of potentially toxic BAs and other biliary constituents, serving as a potential additional hit to NASH progression. Indeed, three-dimensional spatially resolved imaging of human NASH livers revealed profound topological defects in the bile canaliculi network, consistent with an underlying microcholestatic state (see Fig. 1 ).  Computational modeling of bile flow in these patients predicted higher pericentral biliary pressure which was correlated with GGT levels as a typical serum biochemical finding in NAFLD/NASH, underscoring the concept of microcholestasis.  Hepatocyte morphometry revealed increased number and size of lipid droplets pericentrally correlating with disease progression and potentially contributing to apical protein trafficking disruption.  More specifically, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 which follows a transcytotic route for apical expression was mislocalized while multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP2) and BSEP localization remained intact. Contrasting this finding and in line with preclinical studies in rodent models,   altered protein trafficking and mislocalization of MRP2 and MRP3 have been found in NASH patients, further substantiating the concept of microcholestasis in NASH.   Under cholestatic conditions, hepatocellular transport systems undergo adaptive changes mainly through FXR activation, resulting in downregulation of the BA uptake transporter NTCP, whereas compensatory basolateral efflux increases through OSTα/β, MRP3, and MRP4 bypassing impaired canalicular excretion.   Zucker rats, a rodent model of NAFLD, show impaired hepatobiliary transport compatible with an underlying cholestatic component.  More precisely, decreased BA-independent bile flow coinciding with downregulation of hepatic MRP2 and OATP2 has been reported while BSEP and NTCP expression remained unchanged, reflecting an impaired hepatobiliary transport capacity.   Interestingly, mice lacking the canalicular BA export pump BSEP display impaired mitochondrial FA oxidation as well as reduced white adipose tissue mass.  In line, challenging these mice with dietary models of hepatic steatosis leads to attenuation of hepatic lipid accumulation despite worsened inflammation, potentially through impaired FXR and PPARα signaling.   Additionally, genetic polymorphisms of ABCB11, the gene encoding for human BSEP, have been correlated to higher triglyceride and cholesterol levels as well as body mass index.   However, the exact mechanism of microcholestasis as well as addressing the topological and molecular alterations of the hepatobiliary network in NASH is still poorly understood and requires further interrogation. Even so, these findings support the concept to apply empirically used or novel anticholestatic therapies such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and norUDCA or FXR agonists, respectively, in NASH (see the following section).  Targeting FXR in Microcholestasis of NASH and Beyond  Due to the key role of FXR in regulating not only BA homeostasis, but also glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation and fibrosis, pharmacological targeting of FXR has become a promising strategy for treating NAFLD/NASH.     In line with the key role of FXR in maintaining biliary homeostasis, FXR ligands have first been developed as therapy for cholestatic liver diseases.  Since BAs are increasingly conceived as important biomarkers of NAFLD and microcholestasis has emerged as a feature of NASH, modulating FXR activity as a key regulator of BA homeostasis may be a key asset or at least important added benefit for treating NASH (see Fig. 2 ).   In multiple preclinical models, FXR agonism led to resolution of features of steatohepatitis through its metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects.  Steroidal FXR agonists such as OCA but also natural ligands such as CA and CDCA have been shown to improve insulin resistance and steatosis in obese rats  as well as ameliorate inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of NASH.  As another example, administration of nonsteroidal FXR agonist WAY-362450 ameliorated steatohepatitis and fibrosis in mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient diet in an FXR-dependent fashion.  Additionally, FXR agonism reduces vascular inflammation and plaque formation in rodent models of atherosclerosis, highlighting its therapeutic potential on CVD associated with NAFLD/NASH.     Moreover, administration of OCA in rodent models of CKD led to attenuation of renal injury and counteracted diabetic nephropathy.   Taken together, FXR agonism may not only be a promising target for treatment of NASH, but also for associated cardiometabolic comorbidity, warranting further investigations.   Several clinical trials currently investigate the effects of FXR ligands in NAFLD/NASH and most progress has so far been made for OCA as first in class steroidal FXR agonist.  In a small proof-of-concept phase II study testing OCA in diabetic patients with NAFLD, administration of either 25 or 50 mg OCA once daily over 6 weeks improved insulin sensitivity assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp as well as liver enzymes (GGT, alanine aminotransferase [ALAT], aspartate aminotransferase [ASAT]), findings which were associated with a modest reduction in noninvasive fibrosis parameters (Enhanced Liver Fibrosis [ELF] score) in the 25-mg OCA group compared with placebo.  Additionally, OCA treatment increased FGF19 levels in a dose-dependent manner as well as decreasing C4 levels and levels of total endogenous BAs, reflecting target engagement and giving mechanistic insight into the regulation of insulin resistance in NASH patients.  A subsequent large multicenter phase IIb study (FLINT—FXR Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment) enrolling 283 patients revealed effectiveness of 25 mg OCA treatment in NASH patients compared with placebo after 72 weeks. OCA treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the primary histological endpoint, defined as a decrease in NAS of at least two points with no worsening of fibrosis, as compared with placebo, while no significant impact on overall resolution of NASH was observed.  Again, levels of ALAT, ASAT, and GGT significantly improved upon OCA treatment while serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (known to be upregulated by FXR) increased. However, OCA treatment led to an unfavorable lipid profile as reflected by increased levels of serum LDL and decreased levels of serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In addition, development of moderate to severe pruritus was more common in the OCA-treated group compared with placebo. Surprisingly, measurement of hepatic insulin resistance using the homeostasis model of assessment (HOMA-IR) showed an increase in insulin resistance despite weight loss during OCA treatment, both of which reverted back after treatment discontinuation. This effect on insulin resistance contrasting the findings from the previous proof-of-concept phase II study in diabetics  might be in part attributed to different methodology in assessing insulin resistance as well as decentralized insulin measurements.   Furthermore, in a recent interim analysis of the subsequent multicenter phase III study (REGENERATE—Randomized Global Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Impact on NASH With Fibrosis of Obeticholic Acid Treatment), statistically significant improvement of fibrosis was seen in 12% in patients receiving placebo compared with 18% in patients receiving 10 mg OCA and 23% in patients receiving 25 mg OCA, while the endpoint for resolution of NASH was not met.  Side effects of OCA treatment again were increased LDL cholesterol levels at the expense of HDL cholesterol and mild to moderate pruritus in a dose-dependent manner. With reduction of NASH activity and fibrosis on one hand and features of dyslipidemia on the other, the overall clinical benefit of OCA treatment in terms of cardiometabolic comorbidity or all-time mortality is the subject of currently ongoing studies.   With the initial intention to avoid adverse effects such as LDL increase or occurrence of pruritus, various nonsteroidal synthetic FXR agonists have been developed and several compounds are currently tested in phase II clinical trials.  Administration of Cilofexor (formerly known as GS-9674, follow-up compound to Px-102/Px-104) in noncirrhotic NASH patients revealed reduction of hepatic steatosis as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-PDFF) and decreased levels of GGT, C4, and primary BA, while no changes were observed for noninvasive parameters of liver fibrosis using ELF, transient elastography, and magnetic resonance elastography. While the serum lipid profile did not change significantly upon Cilofexor treatment, dose-dependent occurrence of pruritus was observed.    In another trial, Cilofexor, ACC inhibitor Firsocostat, and apoptosis-signal regulating kinase 1 inhibitor Selonsertib have been tested alone or in a dual-drug combination strategy in a phase IIb trial in NASH patients for 48 weeks.  None of the treatment arms achieved significant changes compared with placebo for the primary endpoint (≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH). However, significant improvements in biochemical and noninvasive fibrosis parameters, ≥ 2-point NAS reductions and its subcomponents, as well as a significant shift of advanced (F3/F4) to nonadvanced fibrosis stages using a machine learning-based algorithm, were observed with the combination of Cilofexor and Firsocostat compared with placebo. Again, occurrence of pruritus has been reported more often in Cilofexor-treated patients.   Another non-BA FXR agonist called Tropifexor (LJN452) has been successfully tested in multiple preclinical NASH models.   In healthy volunteers, administration of Tropifexor was well tolerated and did not lead to significant alterations in the plasma lipid profile encouraging further studies.  Recent interim results from a currently undergoing phase II clinical trial in NASH patients (FLIGHT-FXR: NCT02855164) revealed robust and dose-dependent reduction of ALAT, GGT, hepatic fat fraction, and body weight in patients receiving either 140 or 200 µg Tropifexor over 12 weeks.  Despite a significant reduction of collagen proportional area in the 200-µg-treated group, neither of the Tropifexor groups showed significant difference in terms of histological improvement of NASH or fibrosis stage as a predefined endpoint.  Regarding adverse events, a dose-related increase in LDL cholesterol and an association with mild pruritus were reported. Notable changes in LDL cholesterol levels appear to generally increase in therapies that reduce hepatocellular BA levels through accumulation of total cholesterol which impairs SREBP2 signaling, leading to downregulation of LDL receptor (LDLR) expression and therefore, increased serum LDL cholesterol.  Collectively, these data also raise the question whether pruritus stems from FXR agonism directly rather than from elevated levels of BAs or BA derivatives and drives the necessity for comprehensive therapeutic strategies to manage adverse effects in FXR agonistic treatment including pruritus.  In addition to Cilofexor and Tropifexor, multiple other nonsteroidal FXR agonists are currently under investigation for treatment of NAFLD/NASH (reviewed in Gege et al  ).   As another strategy in the treatment of NASH, recent studies have turned toward FGF19 analogues. Being a downstream target of intestinal FXR activation, FGF19 has been proposed to reduce hepatic lipid content while potentially sidestepping adverse effects of direct FXR agonism. Notably engineered FGF19 analogues show distinct dissociation of metabolic from proliferative potentially procarcinogenic effects by blunting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-activating function of the naturally occurring protein.  In line, preclinical models testing a synthetic and nontumorigenic FGF 19 analogue, Aldafermin/NGM282 (formerly known as M70), were even able to prevent tumor formation.  Additionally, Aldafermin/NGM282 treatment in humans led to a dose-dependent enrichment of BA-sensitive commensal microbe Veillonella, which correlated to physical performance-enhancement through its ability to degrade exercise-induced lactate to propionate.     An interim analysis investigating 1 or 3 mg Aldafermin/NGM282 treatment in NASH patients revealed a significant histological response (defined as > 2 point improvement of NAS without worsening of fibrosis or > 1 point improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH) in 50 and 68% after 12 weeks treatment, respectively.  Although Aldafermin/NGM282 treatment for 24 weeks also showed a robust decrease in liver fat content (measured by MRI-PDFF) as well as serum transaminases and BA and C4 levels, no significant impact on histological assessment of liver fibrosis or NASH resolution could be observed at this extended time point.  Interestingly, Aldafermin/NGM282 treatment over 12 weeks also improved noninvasive markers of fibrosis significantly in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis independent of biochemical improvement of cholestasis, suggesting potential direct antifibrotic effects.  Adverse events included diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain as well as increased LDL-cholesterol levels which, however, could be effectively and safely counteracted by rosuvastatin administration.       Apart from the above-mentioned beneficial effects of systemic treatment to induce hepatic FXR signaling, gut-selective modulation of FXR activity has been proposed as a mechanism to target obesity and development of NAFLD. Intestinal FXR agonism counteracted diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation in mice through induction of FGF15 without altering hepatic FXR signaling.  Contrasting this finding, intestinal knockout of FXR in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice led to ameliorated hepatic steatosis due to reduced circulation of ceramides.  Moreover, dietary modulation of the gut microbiome through accumulation of TßMCA resulting in intestinal FXR antagonism led to decreased ceramide levels and therefore, reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance.  Modulation of gut microbiota in rodents by antibiotics changes intestinal BA composition toward an intestine-specific inhibition of FXR signaling also through accumulating of TßMCA normally degraded by intact gut microbiota and leads to lower levels of circulating ceramides, therefore decreasing DNL and ameliorating hepatic steatosis.  Interestingly, UDCA may be seen as a weak FXR antagonist.  Indeed, in morbidly obese NAFLD patients, administration of UDCA exerted FXR-antagonistic effects as seen through upregulation of CYP7A1 impacting on BA synthesis as well as increasing SREBP2 and consequently LDLR reflecting cholesterol homeostasis in addition to promoting neutral lipid accumulation in adipose tissue and liver.  In summary, opposing effects of FXR modulation in an organ/tissue-specific manner reveal novel therapeutic avenues to treat NAFLD, warranting further studies to resolve these apparent discrepant findings between the effects of FXR agonism versus antagonism.   In addition to the aforementioned effects, UDCA treatment in multiple rodent models of NASH led to resolution of liver steatosis and inflammation.   Furthermore, TUDCA has been proposed as a chemical chaperone to increase the adaptive capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), therefore reducing ER stress and leading to normalized insulin sensitivity and resolution of NAFLD in obese and diabetic mice.  However, clinical trials elucidating the effect of UDCA in NASH have been inconsistent regarding patient databases, primary endpoints, and therapeutic benefits. In particular, while reduction of transaminases and hepatic steatosis were observed in an initial pilot study,  following randomized controlled trials could not show histological benefits or an improvement of liver steatosis or ALAT compared with placebo.    In a subsequent high-dose treatment strategy, improvement of liver enzymes and HOMA-IR could be observed, but liver histology was not assessed.  Furthermore, a trial investigating a combination strategy of UDCA with vitamin E revealed improved transaminases and histological regression of liver steatosis in the combination arm while no histologic changes could be seen in UDCA alone.  Moreover, treatment of obese patients with TUDCA led to improved insulin sensitivity in liver and muscle, whereas adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and cellular markers of ER stress were unchanged compared with placebo.  In summary, based on this evidence UDCA is no longer recommended for treatment of NASH by current guidelines.     Beyond modulation of FXR signaling, TGR5 is a widely expressed G-protein coupled receptor which upon activation through BAs has been shown to increase glucose homeostasis efficiency and exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical studies (reviewed in Pols et al  ). Activating TGR5 through administration of BAs increases energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue through promoting thyroid hormone metabolism and therefore counteracts diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.  Accordingly, both TGR5-selective agonists such as INT-777 and TGR5/FXR dual agonists such as INT-767 have been reported to counteract the development of obesity, steatosis, and inflammation in multiple experimental models of NASH.    However, clinical trials investigating TGR5 agonists are scarce. To date, there has been only one human study of TGR5 agonist administration in type 2 diabetic patients yielding negative results with even elevation instead of reduction of blood glucose levels.  Moreover, TGR5 agonistic treatment approaches are associated with safety concerns. Such being the case, multiple in vitro studies proposed that TGR5 signaling is involved in carcinogenesis.   Additionally, TGR5 agonism is important in gallbladder physiology through mediating gallbladder distension  with preclinical models of TGR5 deficiency exhibiting resistance to gallstone formation.  To address these concerns, further mechanistic studies are warranted.   Other possibilities to manipulate lipid metabolism through modulating BA homeostasis include prevention of biliary reuptake from the intestine. The initial intention of using BA sequestrants such as Colesevelam for hypercholesterolemia was to compensate for the loss of BAs through conversion of cholesterol, therefore lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels in patients. At the same time, Colesevelam treatment results in increased HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, reflecting partial deactivation of FXR by interrupting the enterohepatic cycle.  Furthermore, administering BA sequestrants to mice in dietary models of steatohepatitis led to reduction of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.    However, clinical studies did not show improvement of NASH by Colesevelam.    As an alternative to BA sequestrants, pharmacological inhibition of ASBT to prevent intestinal BA reuptake is being increasingly tested in models of NASH.  In contrast to resin-bound BAs which activate TGR5 therefore increasing GLP-1 levels, free intestinal BAs increased by ASBT inhibition activate FXR signaling, which in turn downregulates GLP-1 secretion.   Interestingly, intestinal ASBT inhibition led to increased fecal BA excretion and a shift in BA composition toward more FXR agonistic BAs in line with normalization of glucose tolerance and improvement of hepatic steatosis and NAS in HFD-fed mice.  However, a recent 24-week interim analysis of a phase II trial involving ASBT inhibitor Volixibat showed that despite target affection seen by dose-dependent increase of C4 serum levels and decrease of cholesterol levels, no liver-specific therapeutic benefit could be noted.  Currently, a wide range of ASBT inhibitors are explored for pediatric cholestasis, but their potential benefit for NASH remains to be determined (reviewed in Karpen et al  ).   Finally, norUDCA, recently renamed as norucholic acid, is a side chain shortened, conjugation-resistant UDCA derivative that undergoes cholehepatic shunting therefore allowing for liver-targeted therapy in multiple liver diseases.  norUDCA has been shown to elicit anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antifibrotic effects in multiple experimental NASH models.   Cholehepatic shunting is particularly beneficial in targeting ductular reaction, which is a histopathological feature typically seen in cholestatic liver injury but also in NAFLD.  Ductular reaction in NASH has been associated with fibrosis development as well as the extent of hepatocytes in replicative arrest, therefore reflecting hepatocyte senescence.  Additionally, cholangiocytes have been shown to be susceptible to lipoapoptosis primarily through saturated free FAs, suggesting their engagement in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.  Recently, a multicenter phase IIa trial investigated the effect of norUDCA in NASH revealing a dose-dependent reduction of serum ALT  inciting a currently ongoing phase IIb study whose primary endpoint will involve histological improvement or resolution of NASH (EudraCT-Nr.:2018–003443–31). Due to the underappreciated role of microcholestasis and ductular changes in NASH, future combination therapies may need to focus on anticholestatic agents in NASH. ",6444
27825144,"INTRODUCTION Fabry disease (FD [MIM:301500]), or Anderson-Fabry disease, is a rare X-linked lipid storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene (MIM: 300644), encoding the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). Deficient activity of α-Gal A leads to a progressive accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids, predominantly globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in the vascular endothelium of skin, kidney, nervous system, heart and other tissue with consequent multiorgan dysfunction. In affected males, the clinical presentation of FD varies from a classical phenotype (null or minimal α-Gal A activity), including childhood-onset angiokeratoma, acroparesthesias, gastrointestinal disorders, hypohidrosisand characteristic corneal and lenticular opacities to adult-onset variants (residual α-GalA activity) with only cardiac or renal symptoms. Heterozygous females show a variable phenotype due to random X-inactivation. However, published data showed a high degree of intra-familial phenotypic variability in patients carrying the same mutation. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), with agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta, has been reported to be well tolerated and effective in FD. Gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) are reported in approximately 60% of FD patients and have a profound negative effect on their quality of life. Post-prandial abdominal pain and diarrhea are the most prevalent manifestations, while less common GIS include nausea, vomiting, and early satiety. Despite recent advances in clinical and molecular characterization of FD, the pathophysiology of the GIS is still poorly understood. Here, we have evaluated the intervariability of GIS recurrence in a cohort of 49 FD patients. In order to determine the involvement of genetic factors unrelated to α-Gal A deficiency in the pathogenesis of GIS, we have performed a profiling of 1936 common and complex functional variants (SNPs, insertions, duplications, deletions) across 231 genes that encode for drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transport proteins using the DMET Plus platform (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, US). RESULTS Prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms The overall prevalence of GIS in the 49 evaluated patients was 24.5% (n = 12). Abdominal pain was present in 12 patients (24.5%) while diarrhea was reported in 11 patients (22.4%). One male patient complained only abdominal pain, all the other patients had more than one GI symptom: ten patients complained abdominal pain and diarrhea, one patient had heartburn, belching and bloating in addition to abdominal pain and diarrhea. The onset of GIS in our patients occurred at a median age of 9.1 years (range: 4–15 years). Ten out of the 12 patients with GIS were under ERT. After a period between 12 and 24 months of ERT, 40% patients (n = 4) reported an improvement in frequency and severity of GIS, while the remaining 60% (n = 6) reported no changes in GI manifestations after starting the treatment. Genotype-phenotype correlation revealed variability in the occurrence of GIS in related individuals carrying the same mutation. Correlation between genetic polymorphisms and gastrointestinal symptoms All 49 patients passed QC metrics and produced useable genotypes. The average call rate was more than 95%. One SNP (rs2235033/ABCB1) failed to meet Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.05) and was excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 1935 SNPs, 1025 SNPs were polymorphic in our population and were used in the association study. Nine SNPs in four genes unrelated to α-Gal A deficiency (NR1I3, ABCC5, ABCB11, SLCO1B1) resulted associated with GIS (Table 1). The heterozygous genotype AG (rs2501870) in the NR1I3 gene and the heterozygous genotype CT (rs7636910) in the ABCC5 gene resulted more frequent in patients with GIS compared to patients without GIS (67% versus 27% P = 0.0191, and 92% versus 43% P = 0.0060, respectively) (Table 2). Four ABCB11 polymorphisms (rs497692, rs495714, rs496550, rs473351), in linkage disequilibrium (LD), significantly correlated with GIS, and the frequencies of the heterozygous genotypes CT were significantly higher in FD patients with GIS (CT = 84% versus 38% P = 0.0083, 92% versus 38% P = 0.0019, 84% versus 38% P = 0.0083 and 82% versus 38% P = 0.0083, respectively). In three SLCO1B1 variants (rs2291075, rs11045819, rs2306283) the heterozygous genotypes (CT, AC and AG, respectively) showed statistically differences between the two groups, with higher frequencies in the FD patients with GIS (respectively 84% versus 35% P = 0.0065, 58% versus 22% P = 0.0289 and 84% versus 38% P = 0.0083, respectively), while the homozygous genotypes CC in rs2291075 and rs11045819 were associated with absence of GIS (respectively 43% versus 8% P = 0.0371 and 70% versus 34% P = 0.0392, respectively). These data were completely confirmed by TaqMan SNP Genotyping assays (Figure 1). All genotypes generated are reliable to 100% as we previously demonstrated.",743
32944759,"Decreased insulin secretion secondary to impaired pancreatic beta-cell function is an essential element in the development of abnormal glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. Using a progressive, stepped intravenous glucose infusion, a dose-response curve can be generated for insulin secretion rates against plasma glucose levels. In cross-sectional studies, the slope of this curve (termed beta-cell glucose sensitivity) progressively decreases from normal to impaired glucose tolerance, and through to type 2 diabetes. An analogous dose-response relationship can be derived from standard oral glucose and mixed meal tolerance tests (OGTT and MMTT, respectively) using C-peptide kinetic analysis to measure insulin secretion rates. This approach offers several advantages. First, it assesses beta-cell glucose sensitivity under conditions that reflect daily living in contrast to intravenous glucose–based methods that exclude the incretin system. Second, it is independent of potential confounders, such as hepatic insulin clearance, that can influence circulating insulin levels and impact on measures of beta-cell function that examine changes in insulin levels in response to a glucose challenge. In line with the studies using intravenous glucose infusion, we have shown that the model-based beta-cell glucose sensitivity decreases with progressive glucose intolerance using cross-sectional data. Crucially, beta-cell glucose sensitivity was a strong, independent predictor of deteriorating glucose tolerance and the development of type 2 diabetes in longitudinal follow-up studies of people free from diabetes. Furthermore, beta-cell glucose sensitivity, together with a model-derived measure of whole-body insulin sensitivity, was found to completely replace the classical clinical risk factors (such as obesity and plasma glucose concentrations) as predictors of deteriorating glucose tolerance. In view of the emerging importance of beta-cell glucose sensitivity as a predictor of deteriorating glucose tolerance, we conducted a genome-wide analysis to understand the genetic basis of this phenotype. The aims of this study were to define the heritability of beta-cell glucose sensitivity and to perform genome-wide association and candidate gene (known diabetes and glycemic risk loci) association analyses for beta-cell glucose sensitivity across a range of glucose tolerance. Results Demographic and key metabolic characteristics of the study population  Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the study population (n = 5706). All the participating cohorts comprised individuals of both genders, except the ADIGEN study which recruited just males. Heritability estimates for beta-cell glucose sensitivity The SNP-based heritability (narrow-sense heritability) of beta-cell glucose sensitivity in the combined discovery cohort, type 2 diabetes, and prediabetes population (n = 3017) after adjustments for age, sex, and BMI was 34% (h2 = 0.34 [±0.09] P value = 2.33 × 10−10). In the Family study, after adjustments for age, sex, and BMI and using the inverse transformed phenotype in an AE model, we obtained a heritability of 55% (standard error [SE] 13%; P value = 7.12 × 10−9). Analysis with the ACE model did not change the result, with zero shared environmental effect (C). The heritability was also calculated using only people with normal glucose tolerance (n = 252) with the same parameters. Both the AE model and the ACE model (with zero variance explained by shared environment) gave a heritability of 52% (SE 12%; P value = 2.73 × 10−8). Thus, the heritability did not seem to be affected by altered glucose tolerance. Genome-wide association study and meta-analysis  Figs. 1 and 2 show the Manhattan and Q-Q plots, respectively, for the GWAS meta-analysis across the 6 cohorts. The Q-Q plots for individual cohorts are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. The GWAS meta-analysis showed multiple correlated SNPs on chromosome 6 in the CDKAL1 gene locus and on chromosome 19 in the GIPR-QPCTL gene region reaching the accepted level of significance for GWAS with P value < 10–8 (all significant SNPs listed in Supplementary Table 1). Greatest significance was seen for SNP rs2238691 (Z-score = −5.953, P value = 2.64 × 10−9) within the GIPR-QPCTL region and for rs9368219 (Z-score −5.9, P value = 3.15 × 10−9) in the CDKAL1 region (Figs 3 and 4, respectively). The effect estimates for these SNP were comparable across the replication and discovery cohorts. The SNPs with a P value between >10–8 and <10–7 are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. To further explore the top associated variants, we extracted cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) associations from 43 GTEx tissues and pancreatic islets from the InsPIRE study. Cis-eQTLs analysis is used to explore candidate genes mediating the activity of GWAS variants. By extracting the most significant eQTLs per tissue for each of the SNPs included in Supplementary Table 1, we found that the most strongly associated eQTLs were all expressed in pancreatic islets (Supplementary Table 3), although no individual eQTL was significant after correction for multiple testing. In view of the potential secondary metabolic effects of the diabetic state on pancreatic beta-cell function, the GWAS meta-analysis was repeated in nondiabetic subjects (n = 4544) after excluding the IMI DIRECT 2.2 cohort and the known diabetic patients in the other cohorts listed in Table 1. There was no change in the SNPs that achieved genome-wide significance (Supplementary Table 4), although the top SNPs identified in each of the CDKAL1 and GIPR-QPCTL regions were different (rs1040558 and rs35541137, respectively). Candidate gene association tests  Table 2 shows the association of known glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), glycemic traits (fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose) and type 2 diabetes SNPs with beta-cell glucose sensitivity (P < 0.01). After correction for multiple testing, type 2 diabetes–associated SNPs in or near HHEX, CDKAL1, IGF2B2, fasting glucose–associated SNPs in or near CDKAL1 and IGF2BP2, and a 2-hour glucose post-OGTT–associated SNP at the GIPR locus were all associated with beta-cell glucose sensitivity. The association of these SNPs was directionally consistent with the expected underlying biology. For instance, the “T” allele at rs1111875 in the HHEX locus is protective for diabetes and is associated with higher beta-cell glucose sensitivity. This SNP was nominally associated with the expression of the MARK2P9 gene in pancreatic islets (P value = 6.35 × 10−3), but not with eQTLs in other tissues (Supplementary Table 5). Other variants included in the analysis were also significant cis-eQTLs in pancreatic islets, this being the only tissue with significant eQTLs after multiple testing for the candidate SNPs listed in Table 2. The associations of the 155 known loci for type 2 diabetes HbA1c and other glycemic traits with beta-cell glucose sensitivity are summarized in Supplementary Table 6. The heterogeneity in the effect sizes for the top SNPs in Table 2 across the cohorts was not significant (Supplementary Table 7). The same candidate gene analyses were repeated in just the nondiabetic subjects. The associations between SNPs and beta-cell glucose sensitivity observed in the whole cohort (Table 2) remained in the nondiabetic subjects (Supplementary Table 8), albeit at generally lesser degrees of statistical significance. For the known SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes and glycemic traits (P < 0.01), we examined the overlap between their association with beta-cell glucose sensitivity in our study and the early peak insulin response to an intravenous glucose challenge (IVGTT) as previously reported. As shown in Supplementary Figure 2, SNPs in GIPR, G6PC2, JAZF1, and FADS1 are associated with pancreatic beta-cell glucose sensitivity but not with early insulin response during the IVGTT, while SNPs in ABCB11, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, ARAP1, HHEX, PDX1, and GRB10 show an association with both phenotypes. Conversely, variants in MNTR1B and TCF7L2 were strongly associated with the early insulin response during the IVGTT, but variation in these type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci was not associated with pancreatic beta-cell glucose sensitivity after correction for multiple testing.",1241

29266534,"MICROVILLUS INCLUSION DISEASE: AN EXPANDING SPECTRUM OF GENES AND PHENOTYPES In 1978, Davidson and coworkers reported five infants that presented with an apparent congenital enteropathy characterized by persistent diarrhea from birth, the inability to absorb nutrients, failure to thrive, and leading to death (Davidson, Cutz, Hamilton, & Gall, 1978). At the cellular level, atrophy of the apical brush border membrane of the enterocytes, intracellular accumulation of brush border enzymes, and occasional microvilli‐lined inclusion bodies named microvillus inclusions were identified as characteristic features for this disease (Cutz et al., 1989; Davidson et al., 1978). This congenital enteropathy has been called Davidson Disease, intractable diarrhea of infancy, congenital familial protracted diarrhea with enterocyte brush border defects, congenital microvillus atrophy, or microvillus inclusion disease (MVID) (Cutz et al., 1989), and is listed in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) as Diarrhea 2, with microvillus atrophy (DIAR2; #251850). To date, MVID is the most frequently used name for this disease in the scientific literature (source: Web of science). The diagnosis of MVID is based on microscopical biopsy evaluation, and includes the detection of Periodic acid‐Shiff (PAS) staining in the apical cytoplasm, immunohistochemical detection of the brush border metallopeptidase CD10 in the apical cytoplasm, and the detection of microvillus inclusions in the enterocytes with electron microscopy. A focal appearance of MVID‐typical enterocyte defects has been reported, which seems associated with a late‐onset or milder clinical course of the disease (Perry et al., 2014). Notably, phenotypic variations have been reported in patients with clinical presentations that are entirely typical for MVID. These include for example microvilli at the lateral surface of MVID enterocytes (Croft et al., 2000; Morroni, Cangiotti, Guarino, & Cinti, 2006; Phillips & Schmitz, 1992; Wiegerinck et al., 2014) or aggregates of electron‐lucent membranous vesicles (Weeks, Zuppan, Malott, & Mierau, 2003). In some cases, microvillus inclusions could not be detected (Iancu, Mahajnah, Manov, & Shaoul, 2007; Mierau, Wills, Wyatt‐Ashmead, Hoffenberg, & Cutz, 2001) or only small ones could be detected after several attempts (Weeks et al., 2003). These phenotypic variations have led to suggest that MVID represents a heterogeneous disease (Iancu et al., 2007; Mierau et al., 2001; Weeks et al., 2003). In 2008, mutations in the MYO5B gene (chromosome 18q21.1; MIM# 606540) were identified in MVID patients (Erickson, Larson‐Thomé, Valenzuela, Whitaker, & Shub, 2008; Müller et al., 2008), and confirmed MVID as an autosomal recessive disease. MYO5B encodes the myosin Vb protein, which belongs to the large myosin family of actin‐based molecular motor proteins and controls intracellular trafficking. RNAi‐mediated knockdown of myosin Vb in an intestinal cell line reproduced several of the disease phenotypes, supporting the causality between MYO5B and MVID (Ruemmele et al., 2010). Between 2008 and 2013, a total of 41 unique MYO5B mutations were identified, which were systematically analyzed, categorized, and collected in an online registry for MVID patients (van der Velde et al., 2013) (www.mvid-central.org). Since then, more unique homozygous and compound heterozygous MYO5B mutations have been identified in MVID patients. Furthermore, animal models for MVID have been developed, formally proving the connection between MYO5B and MVID. Notably, in some MVID patients, no MYO5B mutations, or only one heterozygous MYO5B mutation was detected (Müller et al., 2008; Perry et al., 2014; Szperl et al., 2011), and the possibility that other genes are involved was suggested. Recently, mutations in two other genes have been associated with variant forms of MVID: STX3 (chromosome 11q12.1; MIM# 600876) (Wiegerinck et al., 2014) and STXBP2 (chromosome 19p13.2; MIM# 601717) (Stepensky et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2017). STX3 encodes the syntaxin‐3 protein, which is a member of the Qa‐SNARE protein family that contributes a glutamine (Q) residue for the formation of the assembled core SNARE complex. STXBP2 encodes the syntaxin‐binding protein‐2 also called the mammalian uncoupled munc18‐2 protein, which belongs to the sec1/munc18‐like protein family. Both syntaxin‐3 and munc18‐2 play a role in membrane fusion. STX3 mutations were identified by whole exome sequencing in two patients diagnosed with MVID based on clinical symptoms but without MYO5B mutations (Wiegerinck et al., 2014). Immunohistochemical analyses of intestinal biopsies revealed intra‐cytoplasmic PAS staining, variable microvillus atrophy, microvillus inclusions and, unlike “classical” MVID, the appearance of microvilli at the basolateral plasma membrane (Wiegerinck et al., 2014). STXBP2 mutations were identified in patients with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5 (FHL5, OMIM 613101). Although FHL5 is primarily regarded as a hyper‐inflammatory immune disorder, ∼40% of FHL5 patients show severe chronic diarrhea starting shortly after birth without signs of infection and often preceding the diagnosis of FHL5. Most of these patients require long‐term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for survival. Therapies targeted against FHL5 failed to resolve the diarrhea which persisted even after full hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Pagel et al., 2012), indicating that the intestinal symptoms are independent of immune cell defects. Immunohistochemical analyses of intestinal biopsies of these patients revealed the intracellular retention of apical brush border proteins such as CD10 and PAS‐positive material, variable microvillus atrophy and microvillus inclusions (Stepensky et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2017). Thus, these patients show all intestine‐related clinical and cellular hallmarks of MVID (Stepensky et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2017). MVID‐ASSOCIATED GENES ARE FUNCTIONALLY LINKED The striking overlap in intestinal symptoms and cellular phenotypes between patients carrying either MYO5B, STX3, or STXBP2 mutations and the previously reported roles of their encoded proteins in apical membrane trafficking in epithelial cells led to suggest that these three genes and their encoded proteins represent a common disease mechanism that unifies a subset of phenotypically linked congenital diarrheal disorders (Posovszky, 2016; Stepensky et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2017; Wiegerinck et al., 2014). MYO5B, STX3, and STXBP2 regulate protein trafficking to the apical brush border. Myosin Vb is an actin‐based molecular motor protein that controls the trafficking of endosomes/transport vesicles to the apical brush border. Syntaxin‐3 and munc18‐2 are part of a protein complex that controls the membrane fusion of transport vesicles with the apical brush border. Indeed, the trafficking of proteins to the apical brush border membrane of intestinal epithelial Caco‐2 cells is inhibited upon loss‐of‐function of either myosin Vb (Knowles et al., 2014; Kravtsov et al., 2014, 2016; Ruemmele et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2015), syntaxin‐3 (Breuza, Fransen, & Le Bivic, 2000; Collaco, Marathe, Kohnke, Kravstov, & Ameen, 2010; Riento, Kauppi, Keranen, & Olkkonen, 2000; Vogel et al., 2015; Wiegerinck et al., 2014), or munc18‐2 (Riento et al., 2000; Vogel et al., 2015, 2017). Also, apical microvillus atrophy was observed in Caco‐2 cells upon loss‐of‐function of either myosin Vb (Dhekne et al., 2014; Knowles et al., 2014; Ruemmele et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2015) or syntaxin‐3 (Vogel et al., 2015; Wiegerinck et al., 2014). Further, loss of myosin Vb function in enterocytes of MVID patients with MYO5B mutations (Dhekne et al., 2014; Szperl et al., 2011) and in enterocytes of Myo5B knockout mice (Weis et al., 2016) resulted in the mislocalization of the myosin Vb‐binding protein rab11a (Szperl et al., 2011), and the loss of either myosin Vb or rab11a in murine enterocytes caused the mislocalization of syntaxin‐3 (Knowles et al., 2015; Weis et al., 2016). Moreover, myosin Vb—when bound to rab11a—was found to interact with syntaxin‐3 in intestinal epithelial cells, and the knockdown of myosin Vb protein expression resulted in a strongly reduced interaction between syntaxin‐3 and munc18‐2 (Vogel et al., 2015). To provide further support that myosin Vb, syntaxin‐3 and munc18‐2 are also linked in patient tissue, we have analyzed the subcellular distribution of syntaxin‐3 and munc18‐2 in enterocytes of intestinal biopsies from patients with MYO5B or STXBP2 mutations. We found that munc18‐2 and syntaxin‐3 (and two additional members of the apical membrane fusion machinery, SNAP23 and cellubrevin; Galli, Brenna, Camilli de, & Meldolesi, 1976; Low et al., 1998; Riento et al., 2000)) all localized to the apical brush border plasma membrane in control enterocytes, but accumulated in intracellular puncta in the enterocytes of two MVID patients (Szperl et al., 2011), one with a homozygous c.4366C > T (p.Gln1456*) MYO5B mutation (Figure 1A–D) and one with compound heterozygous c.1540T > C (p.Cys514Arg) and IVS33+3753G > T MYO5B mutations (Supp. Figure S1A). Furthermore, in a biopsy of an FLH5 patient with a variant MVID phenotype and a homozygous c.693_695delGAT (p.Ile232del) mutation in STXBP2 (Stepensky et al., 2013), we found that syntaxin‐3 was mislocalized from the enterocyte brush border membrane to intracellular puncta (Figure 1E). This is in agreement with a previous study that demonstrated a function for munc18‐2 in the subcellular distribution of syntaxin‐3 in a different cell type (Hackmann et al., 2013). Investigation of the subcellular distribution of myosin Vb was precluded by the lack of good quality antibodies for use on paraffin‐embedded material. Together, the published in vitro data and the patient‐based data as shown in this study provide compelling evidence that myosin Vb, syntaxin‐3, and munc18‐2 are functionally linked in human enterocytes, and likely comprise a common molecular pathway and disease mechanism that unifies a subgroup of congenital diarrheal disorders centered around MVID (Overeem, Bryant, & van IJzendoorn, 2015; Posovszky, 2016; Vogel et al., 2017). Although most of the cell line‐based studies involve the general knockdown of myosin Vb, syntaxin‐3, or munc18‐2, patients typically carry one or more of specific MYO5B, STX3, or STXBP2 mutations (van der Velde et al., 2013). These mutations are likely to result in the expression of mutated proteins, however direct experimental evidence of the mutations functional consequence is missing. Such data are eagerly awaited in order to understand and describe how the phenotype, impact, or onset of the disease might differ depending on the mutations. This is further emphasized by the fact that MYO5B, STX3, and STXBP2 mutations have also been identified in patients without intestinal symptoms (Chograni et al., 2015; Gonzales et al., 2017; Pagel et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2017) (see below). Therefore, it is important to understand how the different MYO5B, STX3, and STXBP2 mutations and the affected residues may impact the function of the encoded proteins.  MYO5B GENE MUTATIONS In 2013, we reviewed and categorized 41 reported MVID‐associated MYO5B mutations (van der Velde et al., 2013). Here we have retrieved from the literature all additional MVID patients reported between 2013 and 2017. Throughout this article, we have used the DNA and protein variant numbering system following the guidelines of the journal and Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). Twenty of these additional patients were demonstrated to carry one or more MYO5B mutations, expanding the number of unique MVID‐associated MYO5B mutations to 62 (Figure 2A and B and Supp. Table S1A). Myosin Vb generates force via its motor domain upon conformational rearrangements driven by F‐actin binding coordinated with ATP hydrolysis. The motor domain is composed of four main subdomains: the N‐terminal, upper 50 kDa (U50), lower 50 kDa (L50) subdomains, and the converter (Figure 2A and C). The myosin V elongated lever arm (which contains the converter and the 6 IQ‐motifs bound to 6 light chains), swings and produces large displacements by amplifying small movements within the catalytic motor domain during the chemo‐mechanical acto‐myosin cycle (Houdusse & Sweeney, 2016). Finally, the myosin V C‐terminal tail binds several partners/cargoes and is composed of a long coiled‐coil region allowing motor dimerization and a terminal globular tail domain (Trybus, 2008). The localization of the consequential amino acid substitutions in a homology model of the 3D structure of the myosin Vb motor domain (Figure 2C) is depicted in Figure 2D. For MYO5B mutation analyses, reference sequence NM_001080467.2 was used. Of the 25 MYO5B mutations found in these additional patients, four compound heterozygous MYO5B mutations and one homozygous MYO5B mutation present in five patients of different families were previously reported in other MVID patients of unrelated families (this study). These patients were indeed found to carry either a heterozygous (c.3163‐3165dupCTC (p.Leu1055dup) and c.445C > T (p.Gln149*)), compound heterozygous (c.3163‐3165dupCTC (p.Leu1055dup)), or homozygous (c.656G > A (p.Arg219His), c.5383A > T (p.1795Leu) and c.1323‐2A > G (IVS10‐2A > G)) mutations (van der Velde et al., 2013). The homozygous patient with the c.656G > A (p.Arg219His) mutation displayed early onset MVID, whereas the patient who was compound heterozygous for this mutation displayed late‐onset MVID. Furthermore, heterozygous c.656G > A (p.Arg219His) mutations have been associated with colon carcinoma in the COSMIC database (cancer.sanger.ac.uk). The compound heterozygous c.3163‐3165dupCTC mutation (p.Leu1055dup) currently has been reported in three unrelated families of different ethnic origin, also including patients with early‐onset and patients with late‐onset MVID. The c.3163‐3165dupCTC (p.Leu1055dup) mutation (rs10625857)) is not likely to be pathogenic as such as it has been reported at least 41,262 times of which 7,704 in a homozygous manner, and has the highest reported allele frequency (0.3420) in the ExAC database (exac.broadinstitute.org). One heterozygous patient carrying this c.3163‐3165dupCTC (p.Leu1055dup) mutation and a c.1347delC (p.Phe450leufs*30) mutation displayed late onset MVID and could be weaned of TPN and moved to normal enteral feeding (Perry et al., 2014). Given the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of MVID, this suggests that the c.3163‐3165dupCTC (p.Leu1055dup) mutation may contribute to the onset of clinical symptoms. The 21 new MVID‐associated MYO5B mutations include seven nonsense, eight missense, and five splicing mutations and one small deletion. These mutations are found in both the N‐terminal motor domain and in the C‐terminal tail domain of the myosin Vb protein (Figure 2A and B). We have examined these mutations in the light of current understanding of how myosin motors produce force, as previously reviewed (Houdusse & Sweeney, 2016) as well as based on the current structural data available for the myosin V tail (Nascimento et al., 2013; Pylypenko et al., 2013; Velvarska & Niessing, 2013). The results of these examinations are summarized in Supp. Table S1A. Interestingly, the three newly reported amino acid substitutions in the motor domain p.Leu528Phe, p.Phe538Ser, p.Ile550Phe, resulting from the c.1582C > T, c.1316T > C, and c. 1648A > T MYO5B mutations, respectively, affect residues that interact with each other, forming a buried hydrophobic core of the lower part of the L50 subdomain (see model in Figure 2C and D). All three substitutions will have destabilizing effect in the folding of this region of the L50 subdomain. The mutant side chains are also close to the activation loop and loop3 that are both involved in actin binding; thus, these mutations likely affect filamentous actin‐binding and motility properties. Specifically, Phe538 is a part of loop‐3 that is involved in F‐actin binding; the bulky hydrophobic side chain determines the relative orientation of the helix‐loop‐helix and loop‐3. The Phe538 substitution to the small polar serine side chain will impact the conformational stability of the actin‐binding elements and will thus likely affect the force produced by the motor on actin. Leu528 belongs to the second helix of the helix‐loop‐helix motif that plays an essential role in F‐actin binding, while Ile550 is located on a beta strand preceding loop‐3. Both aliphatic side chains are tightly packed in the L50 subdomain hydrophobic core and their substitution to a bulky phenylalanine aromatic side chain may change the relative orientation of the secondary structure elements of this actin‐binding unit. In conclusion, these substitutions can be classified as both affecting the stability of the L50 fold and actin‐binding properties of myosin Vb and thus the force produced by this myosin motor. MYO5B mutations that are not associated with MVID Some but not all MVID patients have been reported to develop intrahepatic cholestasis that results in high levels of plasma bile acids. It was suggested that the MYO5B mutations and consequential loss of myosin Vb protein function may lead to defective trafficking of the bile acid transporter ABCB11/BSEP to the apical bile canalicular surface of hepatocytes in the liver, thereby blocking the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and leading to elevated plasma bile acid levels (Girard et al., 2014; Halac et al., 2011). Recently, 26 MYO5B mutations were reported in 17 patients with intrahepatic cholestasis but without symptoms of MVID (Gonzales et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2017) (Supp. Table S1B). Interestingly, two MYO5B missense mutations which affect the same arginine residue at position 401 were identified in two unrelated patients presenting with either intrahepatic cholestasis without MVID (c.1201C > T, p.Arg401Cys), and with MVID (c.1202G > A, p.Arg401His), respectively (Qiu et al., 2017; Ruemmele et al., 2010; van der Velde et al., 2013) (Supp. Table S1B). The previously described p.Arg401His substitution likely affects the motor U50 subdomain fold and thus the allosteric motor activity (van der Velde et al., 2013), whereas the p.Arg401Cys substitution is compatible with the motor structure in different states and might be less damaging (Supp. Table S1B and Figure 3A and B). Another MYO5B nonsense mutation (c.1021C > T (p.Gln341*)) was identified in a heterozygous patient with isolated intrahepatic cholestasis without MVID and also in an unrelated homozygous patient with MVID (Müller et al., 2008; Qiu et al., 2017) (Supp. Table S1B). Additionally, the monoallelic c.1136G > C mutation (Qiu et al., 2017) leads to a p.Arg379Pro substitution at the beginning of the actin‐binding HCM loop in the U50 subdomain (the name of this loop “hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)” is linked to the deadly disease caused by the Arg403Gln substitution in beta‐cardiac myosin (Nag et al., 2015)). While a proline is a naturally occurring residue at this position for some myosin II, whether the p.Arg379Pro substitution can alter the performance of myosin V and its processivity requires further investigations. Further, we found that the heterozygous p.Gln1079His substitution in the coiled‐coil region of the myosin Vb protein, resulting from the heterozygous c.3237G > C mutation (Qiu et al., 2017), naturally occurs in the myosin Vb sequence of the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), and is thus unlikely to have much influence on motor function. Patients with isolated cholestasis and MYO5B mutations are more often heterozygous (82% (14 out of 17)) when compared to patients with MVID and MYO5B mutations (67% heterozygosity (35 out of 52)), although this is not statistically significant (Fisher Exact test P = 0.35). The myosin VB homology protein structure‐based analyses (summarized in Supp. Table S1B, Figures 2A and 3) show that the compound heterozygous patients with isolated cholestasis and MYO5B mutations often carry in one allele a mutation that corresponds to more peripheral residues of the motor domain that are predicted to be less damaging for motor function. It is possible that this results in sufficient activity for at least one of the mutated myosin Vb proteins. Qiu and colleagues noted that biallelic severe MYO5B mutations (that is, truncations and splicing mutations) and biallelic MYO5B mutations that were predicted to affect the myosin Vb‐rab11a interaction domains were less frequent in patients with isolated cholestasis when compared to patients with MVID (Figures 2B and 3A). This led to suggest that the severity of the (combined) MYO5B mutations contributes to the clinical phenotype (that is, isolated MVID, MVID with cholestasis or isolated cholestasis). However, as siblings with the same mutations were reported to show differential age‐of‐onset and course of liver symptoms a modifying role of other genes, epigenetics or environmental factors should also be considered (Qiu et al., 2017). How can mild MYO5B mutations lead to isolated cholestasis without intestinal symptoms while severe MYO5B mutations can lead to intestinal symptoms without cholestasis? As a possible explanation we propose that severe MYO5B mutations prevent the reabsorption of bile acids from the intestine via the apical sodium‐dependent bile acid transporter ASBT/SLC10A2. Given that in a normal situation ∼95% of the circulating bile acids are reabsorbed in the intestine and transported back to the liver via the portal vein, loss of ASBT/SLC10A2‐mediated reabsorption would drastically limit the bile acid load on the liver and thereby the cholestasis phenotype. Importantly, such a scenario implies that physiological parameters co‐determine the clinical outcome in patients with (a) given MYO5B mutation(s).  STX3 AND STXBP2 MUTATIONS We have retrieved three unique STX3 and 51 unique STXBP disease‐relevant mutations from the scientific literature. At least two and six of these STX3 and STXBP2 mutations, respectively, have been reported to be associated with MVID‐resembling congenital diarrheal disorder (based on immunohistological biopsy inspection) (Stepensky et al., 2013; Wiegerinck et al., 2014) (Supp. Tables S2A and S3A), and nine more STXBP2 mutations have been associated with FLH5‐independent chronic diarrhea (Supp. Table S3A). The STX3 encoded syntaxin‐3 is a member of the SNARE protein family. STX3 contains a transmembrane C‐terminal anchor (TMD) and cytoplasmic SNARE motif (also referred to as H3 domain), a three α‐helix bundle (Habc domain), and a short N‐terminal extension, known as N‐peptide (Figure 4A). The SNARE motifs from different SNARE proteins assemble to form a parallel four‐helix bundle that bridge membranes and mediate their fusion (Rizo & Südhof, 2012). The STXBP2 encoded munc18‐2 belongs to the sec1/munc18‐like protein family. Munc18‐2 is composed of three domains (Figure 4B): the N‐terminal domain 1 together with domain 2 forms one‐half of the protein arch‐shaped structure, whereas the other half of the arch is predominantly formed by domain 3 (Hackmann et al., 2013). Munc18‐2 forms a complex with syntaxin‐3 and other SNARE proteins, thereby regulating the specificity and productivity of SNARE‐mediated membrane fusion at the brush border membrane (Rizo & Südhof, 2012). The munc18‐2 structure is known (Hackmann et al., 2013), but there is no structural information available for syntaxin‐3. However, the structure of a homologous syntaxin‐1A and its complex with syntaxin‐binding protein 1 (STXBP1 or munc18‐1) has been extensively characterized (Burkhardt, Hattendorf, Weis, & Fasshauer, 2008; Colbert et al., 2013; Lerman, Robblee, Fairman, & Hughson, 2000). In the syntaxin‐1A/munc18‐1 crystal structure (Burkhardt et al., 2008), syntaxin‐1A bound to munc18‐1 adopts a closed conformation in which a regulatory Habc domain three helix bundle (Fernandez et al., 1998), interacts with H3 (SNARE motif) domain, and masks the SNARE motif required for SNARE complex assembly (Figure 4C). The closed syntaxin‐1A binds within the munc18‐1 cleft that is formed by two of the three domains (domain‐1 and domain‐3) (Figure 4D). The N‐terminal region of syntaxin‐1A also interacts with domain‐1 and this serves as a second binding site in the syntaxin‐1A:munc18‐1 complex (Burkhardt et al., 2008). Munc13‐1 MUN domain binding to the syntaxin‐1A linker between Habc and H3 domains initiates its conformational change favoring a transition from the munc18‐1/syntaxin‐1 complex to the SNARE complex (Wang et al., 2017). Syntaxin‐3 shares 63% sequence identity and 80% sequence homology with syntaxin‐1A. Munc18‐2 shares 62% sequence identity and 80% sequence homology with syntaxin‐1A and has a similar structure (Hackmann et al., 2013). This allowed us to model a putative syntaxin‐3:munc18‐2 complex structure (Figure 4C) in order to address the possible functional consequences of identified STX3 and STXBP2 mutations. STX3 For STX3 mutation analyses, Genbank sequence (reference AJ002076.1) was used. The two homozygous STX3 mutations, which cosegregated with the disease in the families, included a nonsense mutation c.739C > T (p.Arg247*) in exon 9 and a frame‐shifting insertion c.372_373dup (p.Arg125Leufs*7) in exon 6 (Wiegerinck et al., 2014) (Supp. Table S2A). The c.372_373dup (p.Arg125Leufs*7) mutation causes the introduction of a stop codon in the N‐terminal syntaxin domain (HC) (Figure 4A) and resulted in the loss of syntaxin‐3 protein expression, as evidenced by Western blot analysis (Wiegerinck et al., 2014). The c.739C > T (p.Arg247*) STX3 mutation introduces a stop codon in the central SNARE domain (Figure 4A) and resulted in a truncated protein lacking part of the SNARE‐motif and the entire C‐terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) and extracellular part of the protein, rendering the protein cytosolic (Wiegerinck et al., 2014). Notably, a homozygous missense STX3 mutation was also identified in a patient with autosomal recessive congenital cataract and intellectual disability phenotype without reported intestinal symptoms (Chograni et al., 2015). This c.122A > G mutation is predicted to lead to the substitution of a glutamic acid with a glycine at position 41 which is on the surface of the first helix of the Habc regulatory domain of syntaxin‐3 (Figure 4A and C). The residue is not involved in munc18‐2 binding. Substitution of the residue to a glycine introduces flexibility in the protein main chain and may destabilize the helix. The Glu41 residue contributes to a negatively charged cluster on the surface of helix‐a of syntaxin that overlaps with the apical membrane targeting motif (aa 31–36) at the beginning of the helix‐a of syntaxin‐3 (Sharma, Low, Misra, Pallavi, & Weimbs, 2006). This suggests a potential contribution of the Glu41 residue to the correct membrane localization of syntaxin‐3 (Supp. Table S2B). While the retina and brain (both affected in this patient) differentially express the alternatively spliced syntaxin‐3B and ‐3A variants, respectively (Curtis et al., 2008), the Glu41 residue is conserved in all syntaxin‐3 splice variants, which explains why both organs can be affected. However, the absence of intestinal symptoms in this patient is not easily explained and will require further investigations to reveal whether the mutation indeed affects the stability of the protein and whether in the case of intestinal cells, the syntaxin‐3 function is compensated by other proteins. The identification of disease‐causing STX3 mutations in patients with completely different clinical features highlights the need for functional genotype–phenotype correlation studies. STXBP2 For STXBP2 mutation analyses, nucleotide/protein sequence from Genbank (U63533.1) was used. In the munc18‐2 protein architecture, domain‐2 supports the relative orientation of the domains ‐1 and ‐3, forming a syntaxin‐binding surface (Figure 4C). All the substituted residues resulting from the missense mutations (Supp. Table S3A) as well as the deletion mutations (p.Ile232del, p.Val367_Gln369del) in STXBP2 are buried in the protein core and would destabilize the folding of this protein and therefore perturb the integrity of the munc18‐2 structure and its functions (Supp. Table S3A and Figure 4C). The substitutions in domain‐2 include p.Pro477Leu (found in a buried environment within the protein core that cannot accommodate a bigger side chain), p.Leu534Pro (a critical residue in the central strand of the domain‐2 beta sheet; its mutation to a proline would drastically destabilize the fold), and p.Gly541Ser (the absence of a side‐chain for this residue is critical for the fold of subdomain‐2) (Hackmann et al., 2013). In addition, the p.Arg405Trp substitution is localized in the interface between domain‐2 and ‐3. The Arg405 residue maintains a salt bridge that stabilizes the arched domain‐3 conformation (Hackmann et al., 2013). Its substitution by a bulky tryptophan would destabilize the relative orientation of domain‐2 and ‐3 and therefore also the binding site for syntaxin that requires a precise relative positioning of subdomain ‐1 and ‐3. In FHL5 families with more than one child affected, intestinal symptoms were either present or absent in all affected siblings, suggesting that the presence or absence of intestinal symptoms in FHL5 patients is related to family‐specific STXBP2 mutations. An important question therefore is whether and, if so how, specific STXBP2 mutations can be correlated to intestinal symptoms. Pagel and colleagues noted that most FHL5 patients that carried the exon 15‐skipping frameshift mutation p.Val417Leufs*126 in STXBP2 (Figure 4D) on at least one allele appeared protected from intestinal symptoms (Pagel et al., 2012) (Supp. Table S3B, 11 out of 13 patients). Nevertheless, two FHL5 patients, one heterozygous and one homozygous for this p.Val417Leufs*126 mutation, were reported positive for intestinal symptoms (Figure 4B) (Supp. Table S3A). In the collected patient data, we also identified a male FHL5 patient with a homozygous p.Pro774Leu missense mutation in STXBP2 with reported intestinal symptoms (Figure 4B), whereas two male siblings with the same homozygous mutation were reported without intestinal symptoms (Figure 4D and Supp. Table S3A and B). Further, a heterozygous p.Gly541Ser substitution in STXBP2 resulting from a c.1621G > A missense mutation was predicted in a male FHL5 patient with intestinal symptoms (Figure 4B) and in two female FHL5 patients without intestinal symptoms (Figure 4D and Supp. Table S3A and B). Substitution of the Gly541 residue with a glutamate in munc18‐2 inhibited its capacity to bind syntaxin‐3 by ∼60% (Riento et al., 2000). Thus, at least for these three STXBP2 mutations, there is as yet no clear genotype–phenotype correlation with regard to the occurrence of intestinal symptoms in FHL5 patients. Taken together, we conclude that in vitro and patient tissue‐based data clearly indicate that myosin Vb, syntaxin‐3, and munc18‐2 are functionally linked in the process of brush border protein trafficking and brush border development, but that the precise disease mechanism associated with specific mutations in the individual proteins requires further study. Clearly, our structure–function analyses only provide predictions and supporting biochemical analyses are eagerly awaited. Our analyses may help to delineate which mutations would be most useful to study, for example MYO5B mutations that based on structural prediction should strongly impair the protein's motor function but do not have much or highly variable consequences for the disease in terms of clinical symptoms. AN EXPANDED MVID PATIENT REGISTRY AND DATABASE OF MVID‐ASSOCIATED GENE MUTATIONS We have updated the dataset containing all known MYO5B mutations including information on gender, ancestry, consanguinity, the intron/exon involved and predicted consequence for the protein. In addition, we have expanded the registry with a dataset that includes patients with (variant) MVID and STX3 mutations and a dataset that includes FLH‐5 patients with (variant) MVID and their STXBP2 mutations, together with clinical information with regard to their intestinal symptoms. The registry now includes 188 patients with (variant) MVID and 106 mutations. The inclusion of patients with STX3 or STXBP2 mutations in the registry allows the future correlation and comparison of the clinical course of the disease and the genes involved. ANIMAL MODELS FOR MVID: VERTEBRATES ONLY? Animal models have been developed which demonstrated that the germline or conditional deletion of the Myo5b gene in mice or its ortholog in zebrafish causes the clinical and cellular hallmarks of MVID (Cartón‐García et al., 2015; Schneeberger et al., 2015; Sidhaye et al., 2016; Weis et al., 2016), thereby formally proving the causality between loss of myosin Vb function and MVID (Cartón‐García et al., 2015). There are no reported mouse models in which Stxbp2 or Stx3 is deleted. In addition to Myo5b, mice in which Rab8a, Rab11a, or Cdc42 was deleted in the intestine also showed typical hallmarks of MVID. No mutations in RAB8, RAB11A, or CDC42 have thus far been reported in MVID patients, although RAB11A single nucleotide polymorphisms have been detected in at least two MVID patients (Szperl et al., 2011). Interestingly, rab8a expression was shown to be downregulated at the protein level in intestinal mucosa of at least one MVID patient (Sato et al., 2007), and rab11a was shown to be mislocalized in the enterocytes of MVID patient small intestinal biopsies (Dhekne et al., 2014; Golachowska et al., 2012; Szperl et al., 2011). Likewise, cdc42 has been reported to be mislocalized in the enterocytes of MVID patient small intestine biopsies (Michaux et al., 2015). These and other data from cell lines (Knowles et al., 2014) suggest the functional involvement of rab8a, rab11a and cdc42 with myosin Vb in the pathogenesis of MVID. The animal models will be of great value for further elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie congenital diarrheal disorders centered around MVID, and for the preclinical testing of therapeutic strategies. The zebrafish model for MVID may be particularly useful for high‐throughput testing of potential therapeutic compounds. Notably, in contrast to vertebrate mice and zebrafish, the invertebrate Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) in which the myosin V ortholog didum was deleted did not show an intestinal phenotype, despite the abundant expression level of myosin V in the wild‐type digestive system and its distribution to punctate subapical vesicles (Mermall et al., 2005), which is very similar to its distribution to human epithelial cells (Dhekne et al., 2014; Goldenring et al., 1996). Similarly, the deletion of the MYO5B ortholog Hum‐2 in Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) did not show an intestinal phenotype (Winter et al., 2012). In contrast to humans, mice, and zebrafish, which have three MYO5 family members (A–C), the invertebrate D. melanogaster and C. elegans have only a single MYO5 gene. Thus, it appears that the critical role of myosin V in the differentiation and function of enterocytes is restricted to vertebrates and evolved with the appearance of multiple myosin V isoforms. There are no reports with regard to the function of syntaxin‐3 or munc18‐2 in the invertebrate digestive system.",5116
33657042,"INTRODUCTION Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the most common pregnancy-specific liver disease, typically occurring in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the United States, ICP occurs in 0.25%–0.32% of pregnancies, but is more common in certain ethnic groups, particularly among Hispanics, Scandinavians, and Southeast Asians. The highest reported prevalence in the United States is 5.6% in a primarily Hispanic community in Los Angeles. ICP has been associated with adverse fetal outcomes including spontaneous preterm birth, meconium staining of the amniotic fluid, and stillbirth. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis by Ovadia and Williamson found ICP patients had greater risks of spontaneous preterm birth and iatrogenic preterm birth particularly at bile acid levels ≥100 μmol/L. Although the exact etiology of ICP is unknown, it is believed to be caused by the combination of hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors. Several studies have identified risk factors for the condition, including advanced maternal age (AMA), multiple gestations, and assisted reproductive pregnancy. In addition, women with hepatitis C (HCV) have higher rates of ICP and those who develop ICP tend to have earlier onset of ICP-related symptoms. Given the potentially life-threatening complications to the fetus and the fact that symptoms of the condition typically resolve within 48 hours of delivery or with therapeutic management, mostresearch on ICP hasfocused on obstetricalmanagement and fetal outcomes. For the mother, ICP was previously believed to be a pregnancy-specific condition with preexisting risk factors but no troubling long-term sequelae. However, several European cohort studies have shown greater risk of adverse hepatic and systemic health outcomes in ICP patients—biliary tree cancer, liver cancer, gallstones, cirrhosis, immune-mediated diseases (thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, and Crohn’s disease), cardiovascular disease, and breast cancer. In the United States, there are limited data on long-term liver morbidity among patients with ICP. Using data from a cohort of women in a hospital with increased prevalence of ICP (2.5%), we investigated incidence, predictors, and time to occurrence of future liver abnormalities (see Visual Abstract, Supplementary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B827). RESULTS We identified 475 deliveries complicated by ICP from 2005 to 2009. Two hundred fifty-five of 475 (53.7%) returned to care during the follow-up period and served as thecases in our analytic cohort (Figure 1). ICP women who returned for care were statistically similar to the 220 ICP women who did not return for care or qualify for inclusion in key metrics: age at delivery (P = 0.81), BMI (P = 0.08), parity (P = 0.63), gestational diabetes (GDM) (P = 0.78), and preeclampsia (P = 0.42). Among ICP and non-ICP women, both groups had a median of 4 laboratory tests with ALT performed ≥6 months postpartum (interquartile range [IQR] 2–6 for comparators and 2–8 for ICP women). Median follow-up time was 7.8 years in the ICP group (IQR 5.5–10.7) and 9.7 years in the comparison group (IQR 5.8–11.3). Eighty-nine percent of the ICP patients and 79% of the comparison were identified as Hispanic (P = 0.01) (Table 1). Median age at time of pregnancy, median baseline BMI, and incidence of GDM were similar between groups (Table 1). Higher rates of preeclampsia (9.8 vs 2.3%, P < 0.01) was seen in the ICP group. Approximately 7.1% of ICP patients had a history of previous ICP, compared with none in the comparison group. Among ICP women, those with and without a history of previous ICP (18 vs 237) were similar in ethnicity, age at delivery, and rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes in current pregnancy. Significant differences were seen in BMI and parity (see Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B826). Risk of elevated ALT A higher number of ICP patients had ALT >25 U/L at least once ≥6 months postpartum (75 vs 48%, P < 0.01), with a significantly higher median maximum ALT level (46.0 vs 25.5 U/L, P = 0.03) (Table 2). A significantly greater number of ICP patients also had ALT >50 U/L (twice the ULN) during the study period (48 vs 21%, P < 0.01). Time to ALT >25 U/L was significantly different between the ICP and non-ICP comparison group (P < 0.01) (Figure 2a). Among ICP and non-ICP women with ALT >25 U/L, median time to ALT >25 U/L was 3.8 and 9.2 years, respectively. Adjusting for metabolic risk factors (including ICP diagnosis in current pregnancy, ethnicity, diabetes status, BMI, and maternal age), ICP diagnosis and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with increased incidence of postpartum ALT >25 U/L (hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, P < 0.01 and HR 1.6, P = 0.03) (Table 3). Risk of elevated ALP Highest median ALP in the ICP group was 134 U/L (IQR 82–246) and 86 U/L (IQR 66–118) in the non-ICP group. One hundred twenty-five (48%) ICP patients and 23 (18%) non-ICP patients had postpartum ALP >140 U/L P < 0.01 (Table 2). Forty-two (16%) ICP patients and 1 (0.8%) non-ICP patient had ALP levels >280 U/L (twice ULN; P < 0.0001) (Table 2). Time to ALP >140 U/L was significantly different between ICP and non-ICP groups P < 0.01 (Figure 2b). Median time to highest ALP was 4.0 years and 9.7 years in ICP and non-ICP groups, respectively. Adjusting for metabolic risk factors (including ICP diagnosis in current pregnancy, ethnicity, diabetes status, BMI, and maternal age), ICP diagnosis and Hispanic ethnicity was associated with increased incidence of postpartum elevated ALP (HR 3.4, P < 0.01 and HR 2.5, P < 0.01) (Table 3). ICP and risk of later liver disease diagnosis Sixty (24%) ICP patients and 20 (15%) non-ICP women were diagnosed with liver disease, the most common disease diagnosis being NAFLD with ICP patients having more postpartum liver imaging (Tables 2 and 4). No patients with PBC were identified. Time to liver disease diagnosis was significantly different between ICP and non-ICP groups (P = 0.03) (Figure 2c). For ICP women with liver disease, median time to liver disease diagnosis was 13.1 years. Median time to liver disease for non-ICP subjects could not be estimated because of the relatively small number of controls achieving this outcome during the study period. Adjusting for metabolic factors listed above, ICP was associated with a 1.5 times increased incidence ofliver disease (P = 0.05) and BMI >25 kg/m2 was associated with 2.0 times increased incidence of liver disease (P = 0.006) (Table 3). Predictors of future liver disease, abnormal ALT, and abnormal ALP in ICP cohort In univariable analysis of predictors of liver disease, AMA (P = 0.02) and BMI >25 kg/m2 (P < 0.01) were sensitive in predicting future liver disease. ALT >50 U/L (P = 0.56) and ALT >25 U/L (P = 0.74) during pregnancy, Hispanic identity (P = 0.08), GDM (P = 0.55), and bile acid >50 μmol/L (P = 0.10) were not predictive of future liver disease. Predictors of ALT >25 U/L postpartum include Hispanic identity (P = 0.04) and ALT >50 U/L in pregnancy (P < 0.01). ALT >25 U/L during pregnancy (P = 0.11), AMA (P = 0.57), GDM (P = 0.41), BMI >25 kg/m2 (P = 0.53), and bile acid >50 μmol/L (P = 0.63) were not predictive of future ALT elevation. Hispanic identity (P = 0.02) and bile acid >50 μmol/L (P = 0.03) were predictive of future ALP elevation. ALT >50 U/L (P = 0.05), ALT >25 U/L (P = 0.21) in pregnancy, GDM (P = 0.74), AMA (P = 0.09), and BMI >25 kg/m2 (P = 0.82) were not predictive of future ALP elevation (Table 5). In multivariable analysis adjusting for metabolic factors above, BMI >25 kg/m2 in an ICP pregnancy was associated with increased incidence of liver disease diagnosis (HR 2.1, confidence interval [CI] 1.1–3.7, P = 0.02), ALT >50 U/L in pregnancy was associated with increased incidence of ALT >25 U/L postpartum (HR 1.5, CI 1.1–2.0, P = 0.01), and Hispanic identity was associated with increased incidence of ALP >140 U/L postpartum (HR 2.3, CI 1.1–5.0, P = 0.03) (Table 6).",1314

34964797,"Introduction Biliary atresia (BA) is one of the neonatal cholestatic diseases due to biliary fibrosis and obstruction of the intra- and extra-hepatic biliary tract, which reaches up to 1/5000 Asian infants but only 1/18,000 Caucasian infants. If undiagnosed and untreated, BA can lead to death within the first 2 years of age. However, diagnosis of BA is a great challenge and early diagnosis will limit the progression to cirrhosis. For infants with BA, if detected in the first 3 months of life, the Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) is performed to restore bile flow and half of the children have the chances of survival after 2 years of age. In many patients, the origination of failure in Kasai HPE is not clear, it might be due to progression of intrahepatic bile duct damages and decline repair of bile duct epithelial cells. Also, to prolong life, 70% to 80% of BA patients need liver transplantation. The etiology and pathogenic mechanism of the BA have not been fully understood. BA is a multi-cause disease, in which, the genetic cause plays a certain role in the formation of the disease. To date, many genes have been identified in association with BA. Besides that, variants in some genes have also been identified to increase the risk of BA. BA is also considered to be a result of several pathogenic processes leading to ascending obstruction of bile ducts which affects both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary duct system. The destruction and rapid progression of biliary fibrosis, possibly due to incessant cholestasis and retention of bile components including bile acids. The bile salt export pump (BSEP), a transporter protein encoded by the ABCB11 gene, plays the main role in the exportation of the bile acids from the hepatocyte to the bile ducts. Defects in BSEP synthesis and/or function lead to reduced bile salt secretion and accumulation of bile salts. Based on the existing knowledge, a few studies have worked on the potential role of plasma bile acid levels and the contribution of variant p.Val444Ala (c.1331T>C, rs2287622) of ABCB11 to susceptibility for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). Sangkhathat et al performed whole exome sequencing analysis in 20 BA patients and identified 13 rare variants in 9 genes that are associated with the disease: 4 in JAG1 (Alagille syndrome), 2 in MYO5B (PFIC type 6), and one each in ABCC2 (Dubin–Johnson syndrome), ABCB11 (PFIC type 2), UG1A1 (Crigler–Najjar syndrome), MLL2 (Kabuki syndrome), RFX6 (Mitchell–Riley syndrome), ERCC4 (Fanconi anemia), and KCNH1 (Zimmermann–Laband syndrome). In Vietnam, BA has been reported to be as high as 1 in every 2400 live births. Patients with BA frequently face episodes of biliary tract infections, absorption disorders, delay in physical development, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Affected children have irreversible cirrhosis and require liver transplant surgery. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the potential role of variant p.Val444Ala (c.1331T>C, rs2287622) in the ABCB11 gene in the risk of disease in Vietnamese patients with BA. Results In this study, 266 patients were diagnosed with BA. According to the classification of the Japanese Association of Pediatric Surgeons, there were 5 patients with type 1 (obstruction at the level of the common bile duct), 1 patient with type 2 (obstruction at the level of the common hepatic duct), and 260 patients with type 3 (obstruction at the level of porta). Type 3 is the commonest and has the worst prognosis. Genotyping of ABCB11 variant p.Val444Ala was performed in 266 patients with BA and was compared with 150 healthy control in determining allele and genotype frequencies. Table 2 showed that the genotype distribution of variants in the population was in accordance with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P > .05). The C allele frequency of ABCB11 variant p.Val444Ala in the patient group was higher than that in the healthy group, suggesting a relation between this allele and disease susceptibility. Three models of alleles (additive, dominant, and recessive) were performed in statistical analysis. Genotype analysis presented in Table 3 demonstrates that the occurrence of the C allele was significantly over-represented in BA patients (54.51%) than that in the control group (32.67%) (OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.84–3.32, P < .01). In the additive model, a significant difference of genotypes was obtained in both the patient group and the control group with P < 0.01. The frequency of CC genotype differed significantly between the 2 groups and was associated with an increased risk of BA (OR = 5.14, 95% CI = 2.82–9.39, P < .01) compared to the TT genotype. The frequency of TC genotype also differed significantly between the 2 groups (OR = 2.88, 95% CI = 1.81–4.59, P < .01) compared to the TT genotype. Similarly, the CC genotype was linked to an increased BA risk when compared to the genotype TT + TC (OR = 2.79, 95% CI = 1.63–4.79, P < .01) in the recessive model. Moreover, in the dominant model the frequency of combined TC + CC genotypes in the BA patient group (78.95%) was significantly higher than that in the control group (52.00%) (OR = 3.46, 95% CI = 2.24–5.35, P < .01).",817
28874751,"Introduction P4-ATPases, known as flippases, are lipid pumps that contribute to the phospholipid asymmetry of cellular membranes, thereby being crucial to a number of physiologically important functions. Fueled by ATP, the flippases translocate specific phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), or phosphatidylcholine (PC) from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet. Flippases constitute the largest subfamily of the P-type ATPases, with 14 different human genes of 36 human P-type ATPase genes in total. The phospholipid specificity seems to differ among the human flippases, but is well characterized only for some of the family members, such as the PS flippases ATP8A1 (PS > PE, no PC), ATP8A2 (PS > PE, no PC), ATP11A (PS > PE, no PC), and ATP11C (PS > PE, no PC), while being somewhat controversial for ATP8B1 (PC, PS?) and unknown for several others. ATP8B1 was originally considered a PS flippase, but recent studies in HeLa and CHO-K1 cells indicate that ATP8B1 (as well as ATP8B2 and ATP10A) selectively translocate phosphatidylcholine (PC). The difference in charge of the head group (PS negatively charged, PE and PC neutral), but probably also its size and other chemical characteristics, may form the basis for the selectivity. P4-ATPase gene mutations result in a broad variety of pathophysiological conditions. Severe neurological manifestations have been reported for mutations of the neuronal flippase ATP8A2. The largest group of patients with flippase defects suffer from the intrahepatic cholestasis diseases PFIC1 (progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1) and BRIC1 (benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1) caused by mutation of the liver-expressed ATP8B1. BRIC1 is the mildest variant, with an onset in childhood of recurring episodes of cholestasis, but without detectable liver damage under remission. The more debilitating PFIC1 usually debuts within the first year of life and progresses to end-stage liver disease during the adolescence. The underlying molecular pathophysiology of these disorders is not clear, but the accumulation of PC or PS (depending on what the lipid substrate of ATP8B1 actually is) in the outer leaflet caused by reduced ATP8B1 activity might lead to shedding of membrane protrusions into the bile and inactivation of the bile transporter ABCB11. Amino acid sequence comparison suggests an overall molecular structure of flippases similar to that known from X-ray crystallography of the ion-pumping prototypical P-type ATPases Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and Na+,K+-ATPase, with cytoplasmic so-called phosphorylation (P), nucleotide-binding (N) and actuator (A) domains that mediate ATP hydrolysis by catalysing formation and decomposition of a phosphorylated intermediate (Fig. 1a), and a transmembrane domain consisting of 10 helices (M1–M10), which likely mediate the transport of the specific lipid substrate. A structural model of bovine ATP8A2 (in the following abbreviated bATP8A2) was built based on the high-resolution crystal structures of SERCA in E2 and E2P states and refined by molecular dynamics simulation (Fig. 2). However, the flipping mechanism and the transport pathway for the lipid substrate, which is about 10-fold larger than the inorganic ions transported by the ion pumps, pose an enigma referred to as the giant substrate problem. One proposed solution based on the structural modelling in combination with mutagenesis is that lipid flipping occurs by movement of the polar lipid head group in a groove on the surface of the protein, being propelled by a cluster of hydrophobic residues undergoing conformational changes, and with the lipid hydrocarbon chains following passively, still in the membrane lipid phase (“hydrophobic gate pathway”). Information on the translocation pathway has also emerged from experiments swapping PC and PS selectivity between the yeast flippases Dnf1 and Drs2. However, most of the residues pinpointed in this way as determinants of the head-group selectivity and, thus, as putative interaction sites for the head group during the translocation are located closer to the cytoplasmic surface than to the exoplasmic surface at the so-called “exit gate”, which is puzzling, because the lipid is translocated from the exoplasmic leaflet toward the cytoplasmic leaflet, thus expectedly requiring a means of discriminating between different phospholipid head groups near the exoplasmic surface.  It was previously shown that bATP8A2 can be expressed in HEK293T cells and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography in sufficient amounts for detailed studies of its reaction cycle, which is activated specifically by PS and PE, but not by PC. With this methodology, we set out to study the functional consequences of ATP8B1 liver disease mutations by introducing them in bATP8A2. We report here results pinpointing residues of bATP8A2 that seem to interact closely with the lipid head group during the translocation process. The two juxtaposed residues E897 and R898 may be part of an exoplasmic facing “entry gate” of the translocation pathway. Results Mutants and expression ATP8B1 mutations L127P and E981K have been reported for patients with PFIC1, whereas ATP8B1 I344F is a BRIC1 mutation. The equivalent mutations of bATP8A2 are I91P, E897K, and L308F. Table 1 lists these and other mutations studied in the present work. The locations in the modelled bATP8A2 E2P structure of the most important of the residues studied here are indicated in Fig. 2, which also indicates the position of I364, previously shown to be a critical element in the transport mechanism of human as well as bovine ATP8A2 (“hydrophobic gate residue”). All the mutant bATP8A2 proteins could be expressed together with the accessory CDC50A subunit in HEK293T cells and purified in amounts sufficient for detailed functional studies (Table 1). The lowest expression level (12% of wild type) was seen for the I91P mutant. A markedly reduced expression level relative to the wild type was seen for the mutants I91A, E897K, and E897R, as well (~30%, Table 1), whereas expression levels were higher for the other mutants including L308F, which showed wild type-like expression.   Maximal ATPase activity and apparent PS and PE lipid affinities The expressed bATP8A2/CDC50A protein complexes were purified by detergent solubilization and immunoaffinity chromatography and reconstituted in vesicular form with PC as the only lipid present by detergent removal by dialysis. For assay of ATPase activity, the reconstituted proteoliposomes were solubilized with CHAPS detergent, and various concentrations of PS or PE (together with PC, keeping the total lipid concentration constant) were added, as well as ATP. This procedure allowed determination of the maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis per mg of pure bATP8A2 protein (Vmax) and the apparent affinities for PS and PE (as measured by the K0.5 values for stimulation of the ATP hydrolysis by the lipid, Figs 3 and 4, Table 1). Under optimal conditions at saturating PS concentration and 37 °C the Vmax of the wild type bATP8A2 was 97 μmol/min/mg bATP8A2 protein (average of measurements on 14 preparations over more than a year), corresponding to a turnover rate (kcat) of 209 s–1. This value is of the same order of magnitude as the maximal turnover rates determined for the ion-pumping P-type ATPases Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and Na+,K+-ATPase, but is 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than the turnover rates that have been measured for the yeast homolog Drs2, which seems, at least in part, due to the longer, auto-inhibitory C-terminus of Drs2. Like the wild type bATP8A2 protein, all the mutants required the presence of PS or PE for activation, PS being the preferred substrate with higher affinity and giving higher Vmax than PE. Only diminutive ATPase activity was seen with PC alone (at approx. 3000 μM PC the activity of WT and all mutants was less than 6% of the maximal PS-stimulated activity, data points at 0 μM PS in Figs 3 and 4).   The I91P mutation led to a dramatic reduction of the activity, the Vmax being ~5-fold reduced with PS as the activating lipid and ~17-fold with PE, relative to the wild type, whereas the Vmax was wild type-like for I91A with either lipid. The apparent affinity of I91P was ~3-fold reduced (3-fold increased K0.5) for both PS and PE, whereas the reduction of the apparent affinity was less pronounced for I91A (Fig. 3a,c and Table 1). Replacement of L308 with the even larger hydrophobic phenylalanine side chain led to a wild type-like Vmax with PS as the activating lipid, but the apparent affinity was notably reduced for both lipid substrates, ~4-fold for PS and ~2-fold for PE, as was the maximal rate with PE (~2-fold, Fig. 3a,c and Table 1). The L308A mutant showed more wild type-like functional properties compared with L308F (Table 1). The E897K mutation resulted in marked ~5- and ~6-fold reductions of Vmax with PS and PE as activating substrates, respectively. Moreover, mutation E897K caused a ~3-fold increase of the apparent affinity for PS relative to wild type (3-fold reduced K0.5), but without significant effect on the apparent affinity for PE (Fig. 3a,c and Table 1). For further elucidation of the functional role of the negatively charged E897 side chain, additional mutations to E897 were introduced: E897A, E897D, E897Q, E897F, and E897R. The latter mutation resulted in dramatic 10- and 17-fold reductions of Vmax with PS and PE as activating substrates, respectively, whereas the effects on Vmax were much less pronounced for the other E897 mutants. The E897D mutant, retaining a carboxylate group in the side chain, was rather wild type-like for all the parameters determined. As with E897K, significant increases of the apparent affinity for PS (reduced K0.5), relative to wild type, were observed for the mutants E897A (~2-fold), E897Q (~2-fold), E897F (~5-fold), and E897R (~3-fold), whereas the apparent PE affinity was wild type-like or less affected than the apparent PS affinity, or even reduced (E897R), see Fig. 3b,d and Table 1. Mutants with alterations to the neighbouring arginine, R898, were also analysed (Fig. 4 and Table 1), showing insignificant or rather moderate (R898E) reductions of Vmax with PS as the activating lipid and larger reductions of Vmax with PE, particularly the R898D and R898E mutants where the positively charged arginine side chain is replaced by a negatively charged carboxylate side chain. These mutations also markedly reduced the apparent affinity for both lipid substrates (K0.5 increased 3- to 4-fold for PS and 2- to 3-fold for PE). The alanine substitution reduced the apparent affinity only for PS (~2-fold). A swap mutant, E897R_R898E, was constructed to examine the possibility that E897 and R898 interact through a salt bridge (see Fig. 5). An essential finding with this double mutant was that the R898E mutation compensates the drastic 10- and 17-fold reductions of Vmax with PS and PE, respectively, observed for the single mutation E897R, thus resulting in only ~3- and ~5-fold reductions of Vmax, respectively, in the swap mutant, even though the point mutation R898E by itself reduces Vmax. Furthermore, the apparent PS affinity of the E897R_R898E mutant deviated less (1.5-fold reduction) from that of the wild type than the PS affinities of the singly substituted mutants E897R (2.6-fold increase) and R898E (2.9-fold reduction). The apparent PE affinity of the swap mutant was 2.3-fold reduced, again being intermediate between E897R and R898E (3.1- and 1.9-fold reduced, respectively, Table 1).  The mutations D99A and R105A were also introduced in bATP8A2 and studied, because the structural model suggests potentially important interactions of D99 and R105 with R898 (see Discussion and Fig. 5a). For the D99A mutant, the Vmax with PS as activating lipid and the apparent PS and PE affinities were wild type-like, whereas Vmax with PE was ~3-fold reduced, relative to the wild type. For the R105A mutant, the Vmax was reduced ~2-fold, both with PS and with PE as activating lipid. The effects of mutation R105A on the apparent lipid affinities were slight, 1.3-fold reduction for PS, and for PE the same was seen, although in the latter case the difference from wild type was not statistically significant (Table 1).",1894
31296176,"Background Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disease with an incidence of one per 89 000–150 000 live births among the Western European population. Approximately 95% of NP-C cases are caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene (locus 18q11-q12), with approximately 5% caused by mutations in the NPC2 gene (locus 14q24.3). Pathological mutations in these genes lead to impaired intracellular cholesterol transport and subsequent accumulation of free cholesterol and lipids in endosomes and lysosomes. The clinical symptoms of NP-C are highly variable and can be divided into three categories: visceral, neurological, and psychiatric. Manifestations are variable in terms of the age ranging from the neonatal period (45–65%) up to the seventh decade of life. The earliest clinical symptoms of the NP-C among all the patients are neonatal cholestasis syndrome, isolated splenomegaly and hepatosplenomegaly. Some cases of nonimmune hydrops and ascites have also been reported. In most cases, signs of NP-C-related cholestasis reduce spontaneously by the 6–8th month of life, while liver and/or spleen enlargement persist for a long time. Technically difficult and time-consuming Filipin staining was the basic diagnostic method in previous decades. Since the modern NGS methods has not been considered as a screening approach yet (particularly in respect of high incidence of neonatal cholestasis with 1 per 2500 newborns), the new biochemical markers are highly demanded for NP-C screening. Chitotriosidase (ChT) is the macrophage activation associated plasma-borne enzyme that has been used as a biomarker for a lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), including Gaucher disease (GD) and NP-C. However, the NP-C specificity of this marker is not enough, being positive in various conditions including cholestasis and systemic autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Also ChT is not informative in a significant proportion of individuals because of a frequent loss-of-function variant, resulting in deficient activity in homozygous individuals, and possible false negative in heterozygous cases. Recently the reactive oxidative species (ROS), cholestan-3β,5α,6β-triol (C-triol) and 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC), have been established as reliable and convenient diagnostic biomarkers for NP-C. Data (adult patients) indicates that C-triol has a good sensitivity and specificity for NP-C screening, while 7-KC has a limited specificity. Latest oxysterol profiling studies demonstrate a relatively low specificity of oxysterols as an NP-C biomarker in infants with cholestasis syndrome. Insofar as NP-C represents about 8% of all infant cholestases, we tried to re-assess the specificity of C-triol and ChT plasma detection among infants with cholestasis syndrome for NP-C screening. Results As observed in Table 3, C-triol was elevated in three patients and ChT – in seven patients from Group 1 (one patient demonstrates both C-triol and ChT) (Fig. 1). For Group 2 increased C-triol and ChT were observed in one patient who was subsequently diagnosed with NP-C by molecular genetic testing. All 9 patients with elevated plasma C-triol and/or ChT from Group 1 and one from Group 2 were analysed for mutations in NPC1, NPC2 and 47 additional liver damage panel genes (see above). For 4 (of 10) patients clinically relevant mutations were detected, including new heterozygous JAG1 mutation of presumably Armenian origin (Table 3). For patients #3 and #10 the compound heterozygosity was confirmed by ancestors sequencing. All patients with elevated levels of ChT demonstrate normal range of lysosomal acid lipase, beta-glucosidase, and sphingomyelinase in dried blood spots (data not shown). The linear regression analysis showed a statistically significant positive correlation between cholesterol and C-triol levels in Group 1 (r = 0.69, p < 0.05) and no correlation in Group 2 (r = − 0.17, p > 0.05) (Fig. 2). The correlation between cholesterol and C-triol levels in Group 1 was confirmed using a non-parametric Spearman correlation test (ρ = 0.586, p < 0.05).",589
32646411,"Background Idiopathic or transient neonatal cholestasis (TNC) represents a group of intrahepatic cholestatic disorders in infancy with poorly understood pathogenesis. It is characterized by onset of cholestasis in the first week of life, elevation of biochemical parameters of liver injury and cholestasis for several months and their normalization usually by the age of 1 year. Interestingly, despite the complicated neonatal period (asphyxia, sepsis, parenteral nutrition, etc.) is associated with a higher incidence of TNC, only some of the infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit develop TNC, suggesting involvement of genetic predisposing mechanisms. Bile salt (BS) excretion from hepatocytes is mediated by BS-specific canalicular transporter the bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11). Mutations leading to complete loss of BSEP function cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC 2), a severe and progressive cholestatic liver disease, which may lead to development of hepatocellular carcinoma and need for liver transplantation. In contrast, common ABCB11 variants as well as its inhibition have been associated with transient cases of liver injury such as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), sepsis- and parenteral nutrition (PN)-induced cholestasis. Despite ABCB11 variants have been associated with TNC, the proof for impaired BSEP function in the pathogenesis of TNC has been missing. In particular, no evidence has been shown for persisting BSEP dysfunction after discontinuation of triggering factors. Hence, here we describe a novel heterozygous ABCB11 variant and provide the histological correlate as a potential molecular mechanism for TNC.",242
28027573,"Results BIALLELIC MYO5B MUTATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOW‐GGT CHOLESTASIS WITHOUT RECURRENT DIARRHEA We identified 15 MYO5B mutations, three known and 12 novel, in 10 cholestatic patients. Among these, two nonsense mutations (c.1021C>T, p.Q341X; c.3046C>T, p. R1016X) had been reported in MVID patients without cholestasis,27, 36 and one missense mutation (c.1604G>A, p.S535N) has a reported frequency of 0.001 in East Asian populations in the ExAC database (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/variant/18‐47480747‐C‐T), but is predicted to be disease causing (Table 1). SIFT and Polyphen2 and/or MutationTaster predicted that the novel mutations would result in loss of MYO5B function or cause disease (Table 1). In the first cohort of 24 patients, biallelic MYO5B mutations were detected in 5 patients (P1–P5; Table 1) from four unrelated families. No disease‐causing mutation that matched this inheritance mode was detected in other genes associated with cholestasis (Supporting Table S3). In addition, monoallelic MYO5B mutations were detected in 2 patients (P11 and P12; Table 1). The frequency of MYO5B mutations is significantly higher in this group than in the “other‐liver‐disease controls” (5 of 24 vs. 0 of 26, Fisher's exact test; P = 0.02) and in the “nonliver controls” (one sample in this group contained two MYO5B variants and was treated as a compound heterozygote, though not confirmed as such because of unavailability of parental samples; 5 of 24 vs. 1 of 338, Fisher's exact test; P = 4.84 × 10–6), indicating a strong association between MYO5B mutation and low‐GGT cholestasis without diarrhea. In the second cohort, two MYO5B mutations were found in 2 of the 3 patients sent for targeted sequencing because liver biopsy had found histopathologic features like those of MYO5B disease as established in the first cohort (Figs. 1, 2, 3). However, compound heterozygosity was not confirmed given that parental samples were not available. No MYO5B mutation was found in either the third patient who underwent targeted sequencing or the remaining 4 who underwent WES. Two mutations in MYO5B were found in patient P8 after introduction of a new screening panel that included MYO5B (Table 1). Compound heterozygosity was confirmed by studies in her parents. Her younger brother, with icterus (P9), harbored the same mutations. Homozygous MYO5B mutation was discovered by WES in P10, who had recurrent bouts of cholestasis. CLINICAL FEATURES OF CHOLESTATIC PATIENTS WITH MYO5B MUTATIONS All 10 patients with two MYO5B mutations were born at term, with normal weight, to healthy, unrelated parents. Pregnancy and parturition were unremarkable in all mothers. No patient suffered recurrent diarrhea or received parenteral alimentation. All presented with cholestasis and elevated DB, low GGT, mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values, and elevated serum total bile acid (TBA) concentrations. Blood glucose, ammonia, and alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP) values were all within expected ranges. The rest of their examination results were unremarkable. The principal medications routinely administered were ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and fat‐soluble vitamins; cholestyramine was added to alleviate unresolved pruritus and/or cholestasis. Other major clinical and biochemical details are shown in Table 2. P1 and P3 presented with persistent cholestasis. P1 received routine UDCA therapy for 1 month; his parents substituted Traditional Chinese Medicine for UDCA without any improvement. He was lost to follow‐up for around 2 years. When seen again, aged 6 years, he had mild jaundice and pruritus (TB, 85.7 umol/L; DB, 48.7 umol/L; ALT, 70 IU/L; AST, 80 IU/L). He was returned to cholestyramine and fat‐soluble vitamin therapy, with substantial improvement in symptoms (Table 2), but without catch‐up in growth (height, 106 cm, <3rd percentile, August 2016).40, 41 P3 seemed nonresponsive to routine treatment, was listed for liver transplantation (LT) elsewhere at age 2.3 years, and died untransplanted 4 months later. P5, P8, and P10 suffered from intermittent (recurrent) cholestasis. Each had two episodes of cholestasis, with pruritus during bouts, and was asymptomatic between episodes. For P5, the first episode began at age 6 months. No trigger was recognized. Treatment was given elsewhere (details not available), and cholestasis resolved after 6 months, but recurred after a fever at age 6 years. This second episode lasted for 7 months and was treated routinely with cholestyramine. With resolution of cholestasis, all biochemical test results for P5 returned to normal values. Of interest is that P5 was diagnosed with sensorineural deafness from age <1 year and cholecystolithiasis at age 4 years. For P8, the first episode began at age 7 months. No trigger was recognized. Traditional Chinese Medicine was given; details are not available. Cholestasis resolved after 6 months and recurred, with pale stools, after taking cefixime and amoxicillin at age 10 years (March 2016), without menarche. Routine treatment was given; her parents replaced these with some folk prescription 1 month later. This bout has not resolved to date. Of interest in P8 is a history of loose stools, but not of watery diarrhea, until aged 3 years. Of interest in P10 is that both bouts of cholestasis (at 7 and 11 months) were preceded by diarrhea for 10 days that resolved before pruritus and icterus began. No trigger was recognized. Details of previous treatments elsewhere were unavailable. P10 seemed to respond to UDCA therapy in the second episode, with alleviated jaundice and normalizing clinical‐laboratory test results before discharge. P2 and P4 had single bouts of cholestasis that resolved (transient rather than recurrent cholestasis, at least to date), without recognized triggers. P2 only received UDCA for less than 1 week, switching to methylprednisolone at his parents' discretion. Interestingly, P2, differed from his elder brother P1, carrying the same MYO5B mutations, in showing normalized serum bilirubin and other liver function tests 3 weeks later (age 20 months) through to last follow‐up in January 2016 (age 4.4 years; Table 2). P4 had onset of cholestasis from 2 days old with hepatosplenomegaly (liver 3 cm below right costal arch and spleen 2 cm below left costal arch), but, after nearly 1 year of routine UDCA therapy with cholestyramine, he recovered with normal height and weight and mild hepatomegaly (2 cm below right costal arch; see Supporting Fig. S2 for laboratory values and management). P6, P7, and P9 could not be classified as transient or recurrent cholestasis because of insufficient clinical follow‐up. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL AND IMMUNOHISTOPATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS Core needle biopsy specimens of liver were available for P3, P5, P6, and P7. A wedge biopsy specimen of liver was available for P4. Liver controls from children without cholestasis were a wedge biopsy specimen obtained at choledochal cyst excision (A) and non‐neoplastic liver incidentally resected at hepatoblastoma excision (B). Wedge biopsy specimens of liver taken at hepatic portoenterostomy in extrahepatic biliary atresia served as liver controls from children with cholestasis (control A in Fig. 1; controls A, B, and C in Figs. 2 and 3). Subsequent evaluation (B.S., A.S.K.) included material from P3, P4, and P5 as well as from a wedge biopsy specimen of liver from an infant with known ABCB11 mutation and predicted BSEP deficiency (NM_003742: c.1243C>T, p. I498T / c.1493T>C, R415X, Fig. 3D) and discarded tissue from a healthy liver donor (Fig. 3E). Hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis, with lobular disarray and giant‐cell change of hepatocytes, was observed in all patient specimens (Fig. 1). Marking for CK7 and CK19 highlighted slight ductular reaction in all patient specimens other than that from P6. Marking for MYO5B, in the form of fine granules, was scant in control noncholestatic liver; it was observed principally in periportal regions (Fig. 2, controls A and B). Granules were larger and more numerous in control cholestatic liver (Fig. 2C), but were similarly distributed. Coarsely granular marking for MYO5B was diffusely present in all MYO5B patient specimens. Marking for BSEP at bile canaliculi was initially assessed as decreased in P3‐P7, with displacement into cytoplasm in P5. Separate immunostaining with patient‐blinded review of P3‐P5 and controls A‐E (B.S., A.S.K.) found no expression of BSEP in P3 or in the patient with a known ABCB11 mutation. In both P4 and P5, BSEP marking at bile canaliculi was assessed as weak (Fig. 3). ABCB4 immunostaining showed disorganized canalicular marking in MYO5B patients whereas crisply well‐defined canalicular distribution was observed in normal controls (Supporting Fig. S3). PLASMA BILE ACID PROFILES Plasma bile acid profiles during cholestasis in P1, P2, P4, and P5 were compared with those of 16 patients with cholestasis genetically confirmed as associated with ABCB11 mutation and those of 20 healthy donors. A significant increase in plasma concentrations of bile acids over healthy controls was observed in the 4 MYO5B‐mutated patients, with much higher values for total, primary, and conjugated bile acids as well as for UDCA (Fig. 4). The bile acid profiles in MYO5B mutation were very similar to those in ABCB11 mutation (Fig. 4). This suggests stagnation of hepatocellular secretion of these bile acid species into bile in both disorders. The increase of total bile acids in plasma likely resulted from both the administration of UDCA (<200 μM) and primary cholestasis (accounting for up to 400 μM of total serum bile acids; cf. Fig. 4A,F). Concentrations of free bile acids in plasma were significantly lower for MYO5B‐mutated patients than for healthy controls (Fig. 4C), consistent with poor biliary secretion of bile acids and decreased concentrations of bile acids in chyme. Of note is that P2 and P4, in whom cholestasis resolved after treatment with UDCA and other medications, had higher concentrations of TBAs, secondary conjugated bile acids, and UDCA in plasma than did P1 and P5, who had persistent cholestasis (Fig. 4A,B,D,E,F). Bile acid profiles in plasma from P2 obtained before and after resolution of cholestasis were also compared (Table 3). TBA concentrations fell 100‐fold with resolution. Of interest is that whereas glycine conjugates of bile acids typically predominate in humans,35 taurine‐conjugated bile acid concentrations rose in P2 after resolution of cholestasis (Supporting Table S4). The significance of these differences is unknown. ISOLATED CHOLESTASIS IS MORE LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH NONSEVERE MUTATIONS IN MYO5B  A review of our patients with MYO5B deficiency and those reported by others24, 25, 27, 29, 36, 37, 38 identified 15 patients from 13 unrelated families with isolated cholestasis and 39 patients from 38 unrelated families with MVID. We compared MYO5B‐associated isolated cholestasis and MVID based on nature of mutations by severity or by presumed effect on MYO5B‐RAB11A interaction. We found that biallelic severe mutations were less frequent in the isolated cholestasis subgroup than in the MVID subgroup (0 of 13 vs. 11 of 38; P = 0.046; Fig. 5) as were biallelic mutations affecting the MYO5B‐RAB11A interaction domain (5 of 13 vs. 28 of 38; P = 0.041).",1740
30934130,"Introduction Androgenic anabolic steroids are modified androgens or prohormones that promote muscle growth and are used to enhance athletic performance or improve physique. Several anabolic steroids have been approved as therapy of hypogonadism, cachexia, anaemia and other disorders. However, these products can also cause diverse liver abnormalities, including severe and prolonged cholestatic liver injury, peliosis hepatis, hepatic adenoma and even hepatocellular carcinoma with prolonged use, albeit in a minority of patients. These risks, as well as cardiovascular injury, hyperlipidaemia, and infertility, along with the development of dependence, have prompted increasing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulation of anabolic steroids in the United States. Despite the increased oversight, numerous examples of contamination of body building supplements with illegal anabolic steroids have been reported, demonstrating that these supplements remain an important source of illicit anabolic steroid exposure. Little is known about the pathophysiological mechanisms of prolonged cholestasis associated with anabolic steroids or who is at risk for developing liver injury. Previous small studies have identified a few variants associated with genetic cholestatic disorders in those that develop cholestastic liver injury after using body building supplements. Anabolic steroid modifications allowing for oral administration and those specifically with a C-17 alkylated modification are known to be associated with cholestatic liver injury, but a detailed time course of liver injury, histologic evaluation, genetic characterization and chemical analysis of supplements in a large cohort is lacking. The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has prospectively enrolled patients with drug or herbal and dietary supplement -associated liver injury to characterize their clinical features and to generate a well-phenotyped biospecimen repository for future mechanistic and genetic association studies. A previous review of the DILIN’s experience with herbal and dietary supplement, which constituted the second most common class of agents causing drug induced liver injury (DILI), identified supplements advertised to promote body building as the largest class within this category. Patients consuming body building supplements often presented with a distinct clinical phenotype of a profound cholestatic liver injury in the absence of significant biliary obstruction. The current report now describes the clinical features, laboratory findings, histological features, and outcomes among 44 consecutive patients enrolled with body building supplements induced liver injury in this well characterized prospective cohort of patients. In addition, chemical analysis of the ingested products in 14 subjects and potential genetic associations were conducted in 41 cases, respectively, to explore potential exposure to anabolic steroids and mechanisms of liver injury. Results Demographics, Clinical Features and Laboratory Findings The demographic and clinical features of the 44 patients with liver injury attributed to body building supplements enrolled between 2004 to November 2013 are shown in Table 1 and laboratory and outcome features in Table 2. All patients were adult males with a median age of 31.5 years (range: 21 to 59) with 82% self-reporting their race as white or Caucasian, 11% as African-Americans, 2% Asian and 5% multiracial or other and 11% identified themselves as Latino. Twenty-one percent reported prior drug allergies and 80% admitted to drinking alcohol at least once in the past year. Of those that consumed alcohol, 5 were heavy drinkers as defined by consuming more than 3 drinks per day. There was no significant clinical or laboratory differences in those that were heavy drinkers (n=5) compared to the non-heavy alcohol consumers (n= 30). No one reported any pre-existing diabetes or chronic medical condition and only 3 had hypertension. One patient was HIV positive and 3 had established chronic HCV infection. The median time from the start of the body building supplement to onset of liver injury was 76 days, 9% occurring within the first 2 to 4 weeks and 14% occurring after 24 weeks, although precise dates of starting and stopping the supplements were often lacking. All patients presented with jaundice and most (84%) with pruritus, strongly suggesting cholestatic liver injury. Ninety-eight percent took an oral agent and one used self-administered intramuscular injections of reported testosterone-3-propionate, which had been purchased in Mexico without a prescription. None of the body building supplements taken by the patients were prescribed or supervised by a physician. All of them consumed the supplements to enhance physique or augment muscle mass, often in combination with an exercise and weight loss program and with various nutritional supplements such as whey protein and creatine. Table 2 includes results of initial laboratory tests obtained an average of 96 days after initiating body building supplements. The median initial serum ALT value was modestly elevated (169 U/L) with a wide range (61 to 1254 U/L) and over half had ALT levels > 3 ULN. All patients presented with significant jaundice with a median total serum bilirubin value of 9.8 mg/dL (range, 4.1 to 45.7 mg/dL). Despite the clinical symptoms suggestive of a cholestatic pattern of liver injury, the initial median Alk Phos value was only 111 U/L (range, 53 to 461 U/L), with 70% of subjects having values within the local normal range. The median calculated R value on presentation was 3.9, only 29% presenting with a cholestatic pattern of liver injury (R <2) and 40% presenting with a hepatocellular pattern (R > 5), despite the prominence of jaundice and pruritus. The elevated R value was largely due to the normal or minimally elevated levels of Alk Phos, rather than high ALT values. One or more gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels were available in 39 patients, but only 2 at onset, and only 2 had raised values, with the peak median GGT of 44.5 U/L, with a range of 13 to 118. Elevated serum cholesterol (median of 202 mg/dL: n = 34, range 62 to 630) and triglyceride (median 233 mg/dL: n = 36, range 6.3 to 614) levels were also observed at onset. Twenty percent of subjects underwent an ERCP or MRCP and 59% had a liver biopsy as part of their initial evaluation. Duration of Injury and Pattern of Hepatic Injury Jaundice was typically prolonged, the median time from onset to serum bilirubin falling below 2.5 mg/dL being slightly more than 3 months (94 days). Typically, serum aminotransferase levels fell rapidly during the course of the disease, the peak median ALT value (189 U/L) being minimally higher than the median value on presentation (169 U/L). In contrast, serum Alk Phos levels typically rose, the peak median value being twice that of the initial value (257 vs. 111 U/L). For these reasons, the R value fell rapidly during the course of the injury to a median of less than 2 (cholestatic) within 2 weeks. Figure 1 illustrates the pattern of serum ALT, Alk Phos and bilirubin over time after enrollment based on available data. Despite the marked hyperbilirubinemia, signs of hepatic failure were uncommon with the median peak INR being 1.1 (range from 0.9 to 2.1) with only 6 greater than 1.5. No patient developed ascites or hepatic encephalopathy. Several, however, developed renal insufficiency with serum creatinine levels rising above 1.5 mg/dL in 6 patients and above 2.5 mg/dL in 3 (peak values 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3 mg/dL). Peak serum bilirubin levels in these 3 patients with renal insufficiency were all very high (46.7, 46.8 and 50.9 mg/dL) and all patients had resolution of the renal insufficiency with recovery from the liver injury. Liver Histology Twenty-six patients underwent liver biopsies, of which 22 were available for independent review by the DILIN hepatic pathologist (DEK), who was masked to all clinical information. The median time from DILI onset to the liver biopsy was 15 days (range 1 to 68). The most common histologic pattern was a mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic injury (77%) and only 4 (18%) had acute cholestasis. Hepatocellular injury was typically spotty and mild, and no patient had bridging or confluent necrosis. Some degree of cholestasis was found in all biopsies but bile duct injury was found in only 14% without any bile duct loss. Steatosis was uncommon (10%) and no patient had more than mild portal fibrosis. One case showed microscopic evidence suggestive of peliosis hepatis and nodular regeneration. Figure 2 illustrates some common histological features identified. Causality Assessment, Severity of Liver Injury and Chronicity Of the 44 cases, 25 were scored as definite and 19 as highly likely, while none were considered probable, reflecting the consistent phenotype and demographic characteristics of those with body building supplement induced liver injury. The mean severity of illness was 3 with a range of 2 to 4 where 2 represented presence of jaundice, 3 as jaundice with hospitalization and 4 as severe injury with evidence of hepatic or another organ failure. Thirty-one subjects (71%) were hospitalized for the acute liver injury (severity 3), but none died or underwent liver transplantation (severity 5) as was recently reported in another cohort. Of the 44 subjects with body building supplement induced liver injury, only 16 (36%) returned for their scheduled 6-month follow up visit, of whom half had ALT greater than ULN. Twelve subjects returned at 12 months with 2 having ALT greater than ULN. In all cases, the serum enzyme elevations were mild and no patient was persistently jaundiced or symptomatic. Chemical Analysis of Body Building Supplement Components Starting in 2009, the available incriminated herbal and dietary supplement products were submitted to a centralized repository, where they were catalogued and stored for future analysis. Thirty-three body building products were collected from 14 patients (subjects commonly consumed more than one body building supplement at a time) and were screened for anabolic steroids and related compounds. At least one anabolic steroid was identified in 14 body building supplements provided by 9 of the 14 patients but not in the 19 supplements from the remaining 5. The labels often did not accurately reflect the chemical structure of the components as 17 of the 21 body building supplements contained anabolic steroids that were different from those listed on the label and 12 of the steroids listed on the labels were not identified by chemical analysis. Only 6 anabolic steroids listed on the label were confirmed by chemical analysis. The anabolic steroids that were most frequently encountered were methyldrostanolone (55%) followed by tetrahydrocorticosterone (44%), 4-androstenedione (33%) and DHEA (33%). Listed in Supplemental Table S1 are the case numbers, names of the primary body building supplements suspected to be the cause of the liver injury, whether the product label listed an anabolic steroid as an ingredient and, in 14 samples (9 subjects), whether an anabolic steroid was identified analytically. In some cases, none of the products contained detectable anabolic steroids or the product believed to contain one was not available for testing. Thirteen of the steroids identified were DEA controlled substances. Genetic Association Studies Twenty-five patients underwent whole genome sequencing. Among the 22 patients of European-American ethnicity who underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS), 4 were heterozygous (carriers) for rare missense variants in candidate genes previously reported to be associated with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) disorders: ATP8B1 (PFIC1), ABCB11 (BSEP) (PFIC2), or ABCB4 (MDR3) (PFIC3) (Table 3). Three additional patients, identified by exomic chip analysis, had variants in ATP8B1: two carried the D70N missense variant associated with PFIC/BRIC1 cases, which also showed some evidence of enrichment in our cases (case MAF (Minor allele frequency) 2.9% vs. 0.4% in gnomAD controls, p=0.04) and one had the N45T missense variant, which has a frequency of 0.75% in European-American ancestry controls. Finally, a single subject had a rare variant in ABCB4, namely, R590Q, which has a frequency of 0.68% in controls. When including the 12 patients of European-American ethnicity who had exome chip data available, 3 additional carriers of rare missense variants were identified, all in the ABCB11 gene. Two carried the E297G variant previously associated with PFIC2, which has a frequency of 0.04% in European ancestry controls, and one carried the I206V variant, which has a frequency of 0.002% in controls. E297G variant in ABCB11 is extremely rare in population controls of European ancestry (MAF 0.04%) but was found in 2 of the 34 European ancestry cases (MAF 2.9%; Fisher’s exact test p=0.0004) and demonstrated a significant difference between our patients and the European ancestry controls in gnomAD). In addition, one of the five African-American patients carried the variant V1112I in ABCB11, which has a frequency of 0.02% in African ancestry controls. The non-European cases did not have any rare functional variants in any of these three genes identified by exome chip analysis. To asses for overall enrichment of rare functional variants in these 3 genes in cases as compared to population controls, data from the gnomAD database were used to conservatively estimate that 12.3% of European ancestry population controls have a coding variant with a MAF below 1% in at least one of these genes, as compared to 20.6% in our cases. As 12 of our European ancestry cases were genotyped only for low frequency coding variants by chip analysis (for included variants, see Supplemental Table S2), some very rare variants may have been missed, but the frequency overall of cases with rare missense mutations in at least one of these genes was similar between our WGS cases (18%) and our exome chip cases (25%). When variants were removed as predicted by PolyPhen-2 HumDiv to be benign, only 8.1% of the population controls were predicted to be carriers, whereas 17.6% of cases remained carriers. Almost 9% of our European ancestry cases had rare missense variants predicted to be probably damaging in ATP8B1 as compared to 4.3% of controls (8.9% vs. 5.6% when including benign variants), 5.8% in ABCB11 compared to 1.0% in controls (8.9% vs. 3.3% with benign), and 2.9% in ABCB4 compared to 2.7% in controls (2.9% vs. 3.4% with benign). In the body building supplement cases, there was some clustering of variants in specific regions of ABCB11 gene as compared to controls. The two ABCB11 variants found in European ancestry cases, one of which was seen in two cases, were both in the ABC transmembrane domain. In contrast, no more than 0.4% of European ancestry gnomAD controls have rare missense variants in this region. Similarly, the two ATP8B1 variants found in our cases, one of which was seen in two cases, were within 25 amino acids of each other; in contrast, no more than 2.5% of controls have rare missense variants within 25 amino acids of either of these variants (Supplemental Figure S1). These findings suggest that genetic variants, particularly in ABCB11, might predispose to body building supplement associated cholestatic injury in some individuals, as has been postulated for cholestasis due to pharmaceutical agents.",2406
29104077,"Introduction Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), an inherited autosomal recessive liver disease, is characterized primarily by persistent intrahepatic cholestasis and jaundice in the first year of life. Its actual prevalence remains unknown, but its estimated incidence varies between 1/50,000 and 1/100,000 births. This disease is classified based on the serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) level and the causal gene. Patients with PFIC who have normal GGT (normal-GGT PFIC) are termed PFIC type 1, 2, and 4 (PFIC1, PFIC2, and PFIC4) based on whether their genetic deficiency is in ATP8B1, ABCB11, or TJP2, which respectively encode an aminophospholipid flippase expressed in many tissues, a bile salt export pump (BSEP) that mediates biliary excretion of bile acids from hepatocytes, and a component of the epithelial tight junction. However, approximately one-third of individuals with normal-GGT PFIC do not have mutations in ATP8B1 or ABCB11 and mutations in TJP2 seem not to explain all of the remaining patients. Moreover, in some patients with normal-GGT PFIC, genome sequencing detects a mutation in only one allele of ATP8B1 or ABCB11 or identifies mutations in either gene that are difficult to distinguish as disease-causing mutations or rare normal variants. This, together with the fact that individuals with normal-GGT PFIC share many clinical features, makes the determination of the subtypes of PFIC more complex. Normal-GGT PFIC progresses to severe cholestasis with sustained intractable itching, jaundice, and failure to thrive, resulting in liver failure and death before adulthood. Although we and other groups have reported that 4-phenylbutyrate improves the intractable itching in patients with PFIC1 and the biochemical parameters and liver histology in patients with PFIC2, no effective medical therapy for this disease has been established. Currently, the only curative options for normal-GGT PFIC are surgical procedures including liver transplantation (LTx). However, while LTx solves the immediate problem of liver failure in PFIC1, it is insufficient to overcome an ATP8B1 deficiency because of ongoing steatosis and fibrosis. Therefore, to understand the potential of a possible treatment plan, it is of the highest priority to develop a methodology to identify PFIC1 patients correctly at an early phase of their disease course. The current procedure for diagnosing PFIC1 is to analyze the sequence of ATP8B1 and, if possible, to confirm the hepatic level of ATP8B1 expression in liver biopsy specimens. However, genomic analysis is insufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of PFIC1 except in cases of nonsense, frameshift, and large deletion mutations, which occur in < 40% of patients who carry ATP8B1 mutations in both alleles. Studies with liver biopsy specimens can evaluate the impact of the mutation on the expression of ATP8B1, but not on its transport activity, even though the existence of mutations that affect the transport activity of ATP8B1 has been suggested. In addition, liver biopsy is invasive and involves a high risk of complications such as bleeding, pneumothorax, and pain. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a diagnostic method to evaluate the function of ATP8B1 using specimens that can be collected less invasively. In the current study, we explored blood cell populations that endogenously expressed ATP8B1 and detected its expression in human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM). Of the various subpopulations of HMDM, ATP8B1 was predominantly expressed in M2c, a subset of alternatively activated macrophages that is induced by exposure to interleukin-10 (IL-10) and whose function is related to suppression of immune responses and tissue remodeling. The impact of impaired function of ATP8B1 in M2c was examined by flow cytometric and microscopic analysis using HMDM transfected with siRNA against ATP8B1, and then confirmed using HMDM from PFIC1 patients. Based on the phenotypes identified in this analysis, we tested whether ATP8B1 function was impaired or maintained in patients with a clinical diagnosis of normal-GGT PFIC in whom only one mutant allele of ATP8B1 was detected by genome sequencing (patients with PFIC1-like disease). The results were verified by evaluating expression of ATP8B1 in liver specimens from the patients and by an in vitro mutagenesis study. Results Expression of ATP8B1 in M2c HPBMo were cultured in RPMI/M-CSF to differentiate into HMDM. After 9 days of culture, the cells appeared as a mixture of round and spindle shaped cells, morphologically characteristic of HMDM (Supporting Fig. 1a) that were stained with antibody against 25F9, a human mature macrophage marker, but not with antibody against CD93, a human monocyte marker, indicating that the monocytes was correctly differentiated into HMDM (Supporting Fig. 1b). Immunoblot analysis showed that ATP8B1 was expressed on HMDM, but not on granulocytes, lymphocytes, or monocytes (Fig. 1a). By qPCR, ATP8B1 expression appeared after 3 days of culture of HPBMo in RPMI/M-CSF and was maintained in the HMDM (Fig. 1b). The abundance of ATP8B1 in HMDM varied between individuals (Fig. 1c). HMDM induced by treatment with M-CSF comprise several subsets of macrophages. To identify the subset expressing ATP8B1, HMDM were maintained in RPMI/M-CSF alone or polarized into M1, M2a, and M2c subsets by the addition of IFN-γ, IL-4, or IL-10, respectively. The polarization of HMDM into M1, M2a, and M2c was confirmed by expression of CD80 (Supporting Fig. 1c), CD23, and CD163 (Fig. 1d), markers of human M1, M2a, and M2c, respectively. Compared with its expression in nonpolarized HMDM, the expression of ATP8B1 was increased by treatment with IL-10 and was abrogated by treatment with IFN-γ and IL-4 (Fig. 1d), indicating that ATP8B1 was exclusively expressed in M2c. qPCR analysis suggested that transcriptional regulation was predominantly responsible for the increase and decrease of ATP8B1 expression in HMDM induced by IL-10 and IL-4 treatment, respectively (Fig. 1e). The expression of ATP8B1 in M2c was confirmed by sorting of nonpolarized and IL-10-treated HMDM based on low and high expression of CD163, a marker of human M2c, and subsequent immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1f). In both types of macrophages, the expression of ATP8B1 was higher in the CD163-positive subset. The lower band in blots for CD163 (Figs. 1c, d, and f) was nonspecific because there was no significant difference in intensity between HMDM with low and high expression of CD163 (Fig. 1f). ATP8B1-Deficient M2c Show Decreased Expression of M2c Markers and Increased Side Scatter (SSC) To examine the phenotypic and morphological impact of ATP8B1 in M2c, HMDM were transfected with siControl or siATP8B1 and then cultured in RPMI/M-CSF with or without IL-10 (Fig. 2a, b). No effect of ATP8B1 deficiency on differentiation of HPBMo into HMDM was detected by flow cytometric analysis, which showed that > 95% of both siControl- and siATP8B1-transfected cells identified from forward scatter- and SSC-based gating were positive for CD68, a macrophage marker, and negative for CD93, a monocyte marker (Supporting Fig. 2a). The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD163, CD14, and CD16, surface markers of M2c, and the number of cells positive for each marker were higher in IL-10-treated HMDM than in nonpolarized HMDM (Fig. 2c). Both the MFI and the percent of cells positive for CD163 and CD14, but not for CD16, were markedly inhibited in both IL-10-treated and -untreated HMDM after ATP8B1 depletion (Fig. 2c), which is consistent with the positive correlation between the abundance of ATP8B1 and CD163 in nonpolarized HMDM in individuals (Fig. 1c). The influence of ATP8B1 on these M2c markers was considered to originate at the mRNA level (Supporting Fig. 3). Based on these findings, CD16+ cells were gated from IL-10-treated HMDM and used to analyze ATP8B1 function in M2c further. In this subset, 90% of siControl-transfected cells and 65% of siATP8B1-transfected cells were positive for CD163 and CD14 (Fig. 2d, right), indicating that ATP8B1 deficiency caused a 77% and 56% decrease in the MFIs of CD163 and CD14, respectively (Fig. 2d, left). M2c, CD163+ CD14+ CD16+ cells, had lower SSC (internal complexity) than the other subsets comprising the IL-10-treated HMDM (Supporting Fig. 4). The mean SSC of ATP8B1-deficient CD16+ cells gated from IL-10-treated HMDM was 13% higher than that of control CD16+ cells (Fig. 2e). Together, these results suggest that ATP8B1 deficiency causes incomplete polarization of HMDM into M2c. Impaired IL-10/STAT3 Signaling in ATP8B1-Deficient HMDM IL-10, a potent immunosuppressive cytokine, limits proinflammatory responses, controls inflammatory disease progression, and prevents excessive tissue disruption because of inflammation. In HMDM, its anti-inflammatory action is initiated by binding to the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) and is predominantly mediated by a transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). After the binding of IL-10 to IL-10R, STAT3 is activated via phosphorylation, which causes its translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, where it binds to the IFN-γ activated sequence in target promoters, and thereby facilitates transcription of anti-inflammatory genes. To understand the mechanism underlying the incomplete IL-10-driven polarization of ATP8B1-deficient HMDM into M2c, the influence of ATP8B1 deficiency on the IL-10/STAT3 signal transduction pathway was explored. IL-10 stimulus elicits phosphorylation of STAT3α, the major isoform of STAT3 in HMDM, at tyrosine 705 and serine 727 and generates two phosphoforms of STAT3α: pY, pS-STAT3α, which is phosphorylated at both tyrosine 705 and serine 727, a canonical activated form of STAT3, and pS-STAT3α, phosphorylated only at serine 727, a noncanonical activated form of STAT3 that is required for its optimal activation (Fig. 3a). Suppression of ATP8B1 in HMDM had no influence on the expression of IL-10R, STAT3α, and STAT3β, an alternative splicing variant of STAT3 that lacks the transactivation domain (Fig. 3a, b). However, ATP8B1 depletion attenuated the IL-10-driven formation of pS-STAT3α, but not of pY, pS-STAT3α (Fig. 3a, c, and d). The amount of pS-STAT3 was 54% lower in the steady state and 80% lower 60 min after IL-10 stimulation in HMDM transfected with siATP8B1 than in those transfected by siControl (Fig. 3d). Consistent with this finding, ATP8B1 suppression markedly reduced the mRNA expression of the STAT3-regulated genes, SOCS3, ZNF36, and SBNO2, both in the steady state and following IL-10 stimulus (Fig. 3e). Determination of the Subtype of PFIC Using Liver Specimens and an in vitro Mutagenesis Study Sequencing of the genes responsible for neonatal/infantile intrahepatic cholestasis (ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, TJP2, JAG1, NOTCH2, ABCC2, SLC25A13, HSD3B7, AKR1D1, CYP7B1, VPS33B, BAAT, EPHX1, SLC10A1) in 12 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of normal-GGT PFIC identified mutations in both alleles of ATP8B1 (PFIC1) in four patients and in one allele (PFIC1-like) in four patients; and mutations in both alleles of ABCB11 (which encodes BSEP) (PFIC2) in three patients and in one allele (PFIC2-like) in one patient (Table 1). The patient with PFIC1-like and PFIC2-like disease had no mutations in other relevant genes. The genetic diagnosis of PFIC1 and PFIC2 was further supported by much lower expression of ATP8B1 and BSEP in membrane fractions from liver specimens of patients with PFIC1 and PFIC2, respectively, than in control subjects (Fig. 4a). Although liver specimens were unavailable for two patients (no.3 and 4) with PFIC1, their hepatic expression of ATP8B1 would be extremely low because they clearly had disease-causing mutations (frameshift mutation and nonsense mutation) or a missense mutation, c.2941G > A (p.E981K) that could decrease exogenous ATP8B1WT–FLAG expression by about 80% in CHO-K1 cells expressing HA-CDC50A, which forms a complex with ATP8B1 and assists its correct trafficking to the plasma membrane (PM) (Fig. 4b). The abundance of ATP8B1 in the membrane fractions from liver varied between patients with PFIC1-like disease (Fig. 4a). Expression of ATP8B1 was below the quantification limit in PFIC1-like patients 1, 2, and 3, but normal in PFIC1-like patient 4, who possessed three missense mutations in one allele of ATP8B1, each of which has been reported to occur at an allele frequency of about 5% in East Asian populations (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). ATP8B1Triple–FLAG, a mutated form of ATP8B1–FLAG incorporating these three mutations, showed equivalent cell surface expression and similar cellular localization to ATP8B1WT–FLAG in CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 4b, c). The intrinsic molecular function of ATP8B1 is to translocate aminophospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet of biological membranes. Incorporation into the inner leaflet of the PM of nitrobenzoxadiazole-labeled phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC), which cannot be extracted with fatty acid-free BSA, was linear for up to 15 min in ATP8B1WT–FLAG-transfected CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 4d). Its level at 15 min was unaffected by the three mutations harbored by PFIC1-like patient 4, but was decreased to an equal degree to that in empty-vector-transfected cells after the introduction of c.916 T > C (p.C306R) and c.2941G > A (p.E981K) mutations (Fig. 4e), which were harbored in PFIC1 patients 2 and 3 (Table 1). Overall, these results indicated that PFIC1-like patients 1, 2, and 3, but not patients 4, suffered from PFIC1. Diagnosis of PFIC1 in Patients With Normal-GGT PFIC Using Phenotypic Characteristics of M2c Based on the finding that siRNA-mediated suppression of ATP8B1 caused incomplete polarization of HMDM into M2c (Fig. 2), HPBMo from patients with normal-GGT PFIC were differentiated into HMDM and their polarization to M2c were facilitated by IL-10 stimulation. Flow cytometric analysis of HPBMo based on surface expression of CD14 and CD16, which divided HPBMo into three functionally distinct populations, showed no significant difference between PFIC1 patients and control subjects (Supporting Fig. 5). Correct differentiation of HPBMo into HMDM in the patients with PFIC1 was confirmed by their staining for CD68, but not for CD93 (Supporting Fig. 2b). In all four patients with PFIC1, IL-10-treated HMDM showed decreased expression of CD163 and CD14 and increased SSC (Fig. 5a), compared with cells from control subjects, which were prepared from the HPBMo of at least three individuals to minimize interindividual variability (Fig. 1c). The IL-10-treated HMDM from patients with PFIC2 and PFIC2-like disease, who in the early stages of disease present with clinical symptom similar to those of PFIC1, showed an almost identical phenotypic and morphological pattern to those of the control subjects. The MFI of CD163 and CD14 and the mean value of SSC in IL-10-treated HMDM calculated relative to the values in control subjects, were 61 ± 8% (P < 0.05) and 68 ± 6% (P < 0.01) lower and 57 ± 8% (P < 0.01) higher, respectively, in patients with PFIC1 than in patients with PFIC2 and PFIC2-like disease (Fig. 5b). The IL-10-treated HMDM from PFIC1-like patients 1, 2, and 3, but not patient 4, showed the same phenotypic and morphological pattern as those from the patients with PFIC1 (Fig. 5c, d), indicating that the same diagnosis could be made using M2c as was made based on the amount of ATP8B1 in liver and the in vitro mutagenesis study.",2341
18937870,"Background Genetic liver diseases are common causes of severe cholestasis and progressive liver disease in children. Alagille Syndrome (AGS) is a systemic disease caused by heterozygous mutations in the Jagged 1 gene (JAG1) or Notch2 gene (NOTCH2). Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) comprises a group of autosomal recessive diseases. Two commonly recognized forms of PFIC are associated with relatively low serum GGT: 1) familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (FIC1) disease caused by mutations in ATP8B1  and; 2) bile salt export protein (BSEP) disease caused by mutations in ABCB11 . The pathophysiology of cholestasis differs among these disorders. AGS is associated with a paucity of interlobular bile ducts while PFIC is associated with defects in bile transporters. Partial external biliary diversion (PEBD) has been used to treat PFIC and AGS. PEBD involves the surgical placement of an enteric conduit between the gallbladder and the skin through which bile flow is partially diverted away from the enterohepatic circulation, resulting in an approximately fifty percent diversion of bile flow. PEBD has been effective in improving chronic cholestasis and its associated complications. PEBD is not definitively known to alter the progression of liver disease in AGS, which progresses to cirrhosis in 20–40% of patients. In contrast, PEBD has become a standard intervention for PFIC, which otherwise progresses to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. PEBD may not always affect the natural progression of either AGS or PFIC, and no clinical parameters have been defined that predict patients likely to respond to PEBD. Biliary lipids include bile salts, cholesterol and phospholipid. The relative concentrations of hydrophobic to hydrophilic bile salts is also a major determinant of the ability to form mixed micelles to maintain the stability of lipids in suspension. Little is known regarding biliary lipid composition in genetic cholestasis or the effects of PEBD, and mouse models of PFIC and AGS unfortunately differ from the human diseases, likely because the murine bile salt pool is highly hydrophilic. Careful analysis of biliary lipid composition in patients with AGS and PFIC may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of these conditions. We analyzed the biliary lipid composition in patients with AGS, FIC1 disease and BSEP disease before and after PEBD to determine baseline levels, and to determine if composition is predictive of clinical response to PEBD. Results Three unrelated AGS patients and seven children with PFIC were identified and consented for the study. The PFIC patients included four Amish children from the same family with FIC1 disease homozygous for the 923G>T (G308V) mutation in ATP8B1; and three unrelated children with BSEP disease that carried two ABCB11 mutations that would disrupt BSEP synthesis or function. The sequenced mutations included: patient 8 (611+1 G>A/890 A>G (heterozygote), E297G); patient 9 (IVS13del-13^-8/890 A>G (heterozygote), E297G) and patient 10 (1460 G>C (homozygote), R487P). The patients were 7.5 ± 6.4 years old (range 0.4 – 18) at the time of PEBD. The 3 AGS patients were older than the PFIC patients (15.2 ± 3.27 vs. 3.5 ± 2.49 years, p < 0.001), whereas FIC1 disease and BSEP disease patients received PEBD at similar ages (4.25 ± 2.8 vs. 2.53 ± 2.0 years). The follow-up bile samples were collected at 1.35 ± 0.75 years after PEBD (range 0.3–2.5 years). Clinical criteria and response to PEBD Patients had elevated serum ALT (97, 40 – 265 IU/L) and bilirubin (4.4, 1.2 – 10.8 mg/dL) concentrations, and marked pruritus before PEBD (Table 1). All patients had elevated serum bile acid levels before PEBD (183, 58 – 485 μM/L) with PFIC patients having significantly higher levels (254, 97 – 485 μM/L) than AGS (81, 58 – 97 μM/L) (p = 0.01). Pruritus was slightly greater in AGS than PFIC patients. FIC1 and BSEP disease patients did not differ in regard to serum bilirubin, ALT, bile salts or level of pruritus. There was no difference in the pre-PEBD serum bilirubin level, ALT level, bile salt levels or degree of pruritus between patients who responded and those that did not respond. Patients had a significant decrease in serum bilirubin (2.8, 0.3 – 6.9 mg/dL) and pruritus score (2, 1 – 4)) after PEBD. The serum bile acids post-PEBD were significantly lower with median 24 (21 – 488) μM/L, with the AGS group being median 24 (21 – 24) μM/L and PFIC group being median 62 (6 – 488) μM/L. In PFIC responders, the bile acid level was significantly lower (6.0, 6.0 – 32 μM/L) than both pre-PEBD levels and the post-PEBD levels of non-responders (119, 62 – 488 μM/L). AGS patients had a significant decrease in pruritus. The serum CDCA/CA ratio post-PEBD was not statistically different among diseases, or among responders versus non-responders. Overall, three of the 4 FIC1 disease patients had successful clinical responses to PEBD. The oldest at PEBD (patient 7) did not respond; 1.7 years after PEBD he had no improvement in pruritus and had evidence of advancing liver disease with portal hypertension. One of the 3 BSEP disease patients responded to PEBD while the other two (patients 8 and 9) did not respond. Histopathologic findings BSEP disease patients overall had the most aggressive histological changes with prominent pseudoacinar changes and portal fibrosis (Table 2). Of the PFIC patients with portal fibrosis grade ≥ 3, one of three were responders, while of those with fibrosis grade <3, three of four were responders. Of the 3 BSEP disease patients, the responder had grade 2 portal fibrosis, whereas the two non-responders had grade 2 and 4 fibrosis. Only one AGS patient had undergone biopsy at the time of PEBD (patient 1). Lipid composition of bile The bile from PFIC patients had significantly lower concentrations of all biliary lipids (bile salts, cholesterol and phospholipids) and a lower ratio of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to cholic acid (CA) than AGS patients (Figure 1), (p < 0.05). The ratio of taurine to glycine bile salt conjugates in bile and the hydrophobicity index was not different between PFIC and AGS patients. Bile from FIC1 disease and BSEP disease patients were not different in regard to total bile salt, cholesterol and phospholipid content. They differed significantly, however, in the percent ursodeoxycholic acid enrichment and hydrophobicity. BSEP disease patients had median 37, range 29 to 60% ursodeoxycholic acid enrichment compared to median 2.29, range 0.9 to 4.2 in FIC1 disease patients (p = 0.05). As a result, the hydrophobicity index of bile was median -0.15, range -0.05 to -0.26 in BSEP disease patients vs. median 0.035, range 0.001 to 0.07 in FIC1 patients (p= 0.02). The pre-PEBD biliary lipid composition of PFIC patients who responded to PEBD was not significantly different from non-responders. The data regarding the percent change in biliary lipid composition after PEBD are presented in Figure 2 and the individual data in Figure 3. AGS patients showed no significant change in biliary lipid composition after PEBD. Patients with FIC1 disease showed a 4-fold increase in biliary phospholipid content after PEBD (median 1.3, range 0.3 to 2.6 mM, to median 4.9, range 0.9 to 6.0 mM, p = 0.05), and a trend towards an increased CDCA/CA ratio (median 0.00, range 0.00 to 0.07 to median 0.10, range 0.00 to 0.29, p = 0.10). BSEP patients had no significant increase in biliary lipids and had no detectable biliary CDCA post-PEBD, resulting in a decreased CDCA/CA ratio (median 0.00, 0.00 to 0.13 to median 0.0, range 0.0 to 0.0). PFIC responders showed a trend toward increased bile salt concentration and CDCA/CA ratio in bile after PEBD, although these did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3), but no increase in cholesterol and phospholipid content. In 2 of 3 PFIC non-responders there was a complete absence of CDCA in bile after 1 year of diversion. AGS patients continued to have higher biliary lipid concentrations after PEBD than PFIC patients, both responders and non-responders. Long-term outcomes after successful PEBD Patients 4 and 5 had the best outcomes, with relief of cholestasis and marked reduction in serum bilirubin levels. Patient 6 developed severe pancreatitis associated with multi-organ system failure and death 2 years after PEBD. Patient 7 died shortly after liver transplantation. Patient 8 underwent successful liver transplantation 2.5 years after PEBD for massive ostomy output, and patient 9 developed hepatocellular carcinoma 1.6 years post-PEBD and died (previously reported in reference 19). Thus, only two of this group of PFIC patients survived with PEBD to demonstrate long-term benefit. All three AGS patients have had good long-term outcome.",1399
25383786,"Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) comprises autosomal recessive disorders resulting from mutations that impair bile formation. PFIC type 1 (PFIC1) results from mutations in ATP8B1 encoding familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (FIC1). PFIC type 2 (PFIC2) results from mutations in ABCB11 encoding bile salt export pump (BSEP). PFIC1 and PFIC2 are classified as low-gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) PFIC because serum GGT levels remain normal or only slightly elevated despite persistent cholestasis. In PFIC2 cholestasis results from reduced functional expression of BSEP along the canaliculus. How defects in FIC1 expression cause cholestasis is not known. Proposed mechanisms include altered canalicular membrane composition and reduced farnesoid-X receptor signaling leading to reduced BSEP expression. Low serum GGT activity in ATP8B1 and ABCB11 disease is ascribed respectively to lack of canalicular GGT expression and to lack of elution of GGT from canalicular membranes in the absence of detergent intracanalicular bile acids. It is a defining clinical feature of low-GGT PFIC, a term understood to comprise chronic cholestatic liver disease due to known or presumed gene mutations leading to impairment of bile formation. Partial external biliary diversion (PEBD) surgery was first reported to improve cholestatic liver disease in low-GGT PFIC well before the genes involved were discovered. It is an empiric therapy that works without our knowing how. Despite this gap in knowledge, PEBD has gained popularity and is considered to be first-line therapy for low-GGT PFIC worldwide. PEBD lessens clinical symptoms including pruritus, reduces serum bile acid levels, improves the plasma lipoprotein profile, slows disease progression, and improves liver histopathology in low-GGT PFIC. If PEBD fails to resolve cholestasis and to halt progression of liver disease, liver transplantation (LTX) is the only recourse. PEBD performed in a healthy person would substantially reduce the fraction of excreted bile acids subject to enterohepatic recirculation and increase bile acid synthesis to keep up with loss. At steady state such a person with PEBD is expected to show increased bile acid turnover rate and potentially reduced pool size. One hypothesis as to how PEBD improves liver function in low-GGT PFIC is that reduced delivery of bile acids to the intestine (and therefore the recirculation of bile acids to the liver) reduces the demand placed on genetically impaired mechanisms for bile formation. The conundrum is: if incapacity for transport of bile acids is the basis of cholestasis, how could diversion of bile containing little or no bile acids affect such demand? One possible answer is that PEBD improves bile acid transport into the canaliculus. The composition of bile has been assayed in a few low-GGT PFIC patients before and after PEBD. The limited data suggest that after PEBD bile contains more bile acids and relatively more hydrophilic bile acids than before diversion. The latter effect may be important because these patients seem to eliminate trihydroxy bile acids better than dihydroxy bile acids. These data imply that PEBD improves impaired canalicular bile acid transport mechanisms in low-GGT PFIC patients, but this has never been directly assessed. Assessment of canalicular bile acid transport is difficult in human subjects because of lack of access to bile. However, bile is readily accessed in patients with PEBD. Analysis of bile composition linked to analysis of kinetics of primary bile acid metabolism, as determined by stable isotope dilution of the primary bile acids cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), offers a view of canalicular bile acid transport. We hypothesized that successful PEBD results in bile acid pool kinetics that are equivalent to those achieved by successful LTX. Results Table 1 provides the characteristics of the study subjects. Within the PEBD group, 3 subjects had the genetic diagnosis of PFIC1, and 2 had PFIC-U. The 2 subjects with PFIC-U expressed immunohistochemically demonstrable BSEP, evidence against ABCB11 mutations that abrogated BSEP expression. Within the LTX group, 1 subject had the genetic diagnosis of PFIC1 and 4 had that of PFIC2. No subject in either group had serum bilirubin or total serum bile acid concentrations indicative of cholestasis at the time of study (Table 1). Figure 1 shows representative studies of PEBD and LTX subjects. The FTRs, pool sizes, and synthesis rates for CA and CDCA are calculated from similar plots obtained from the individual subjects. In some PEBD subjects the rapid turnover resulted in very low APE values below the limit of precise measurement with subsequent loss of linearity of the ln(APE) plot beyond 48 hours of study, as shown in Figure 1. In these cases, kinetics parameters were computed from the linear portion of the decay only. Linearity of the decay of ln(APE) was maintained in LTX subjects for the full 72 hours. The calculated kinetics parameters for PEBD and LTX subjects are provided in Table 2. Summary data are provided in Figure 2. The CA FTR in the PEBD group ranged from 0.5 – 4.2 d−1 (median 1.5) as compared to the LTX group, range 0.2 – 0.9 d−1 (median 0.7), Wilcoxon p = 0.076 (Figure 2a). The CDCA FTR in the PEBD group ranged from 0.7 – 4.5 d−1 (median 2.1) as compared to the LTX group, range 0.3 – 0.4 d−1 (median 0.3), Wilcoxon p = 0.009 (Figure 2b). The mean FTRs for CA and CDCA in 5 healthy adult subjects from Everson’s 1987 study were 0.28 ± 0.05 d−1 and 0.17 ± 0.04 d−1, respectively. Accordingly, the FTRs of the LTX group, whose members had LTX-related Roux-en-Y choledochoenterostomy and thus lacked a gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi, are somewhat greater than those of normal individuals. In summary, a functioning PEBD appears to result in brisk turnover of both CA and CDCA pools, whereas LTX leaves FTRs in a relatively normal range. In this type of analysis the pool size is computed using the y-intercept values extrapolated from the linear regression of the ln(APE). As shown in Table 2, the CA pool size corrected for body surface area for the 5 PEBD subjects ranged from 365 – 1312 mg/m2 (median 821) and the CDCA pool size from 48 – 565 mg/m2 (median 119). In the LTX subjects, the CA pool size ranged from 282 – 800 mg/m2 (median 522) and the CDCA pool size ranged from 162 – 780 mg/m2 (median 504). As shown in Figures 2c and 2d, CA and CDCA pool sizes were similar in PEBD and LTX subjects (CA p = 0.251, CDCA p = 0.175) despite the large ongoing loss of bile acids in the PEBD subjects. Figure 2 shows the ratio of CA to CDCA pool sizes for PEBD and LTX subjects. When pool sizes are measured in normal persons by the same isotope dilution method employed in this study, the CA/CDCA ratio is approximately 1.3. In PFIC patients with cholestasis, the ratio is estimated from serum bile acid concentrations to be approximately 0.1, meaning there is 10 times more CDCA than CA in the bile acid pool. The CA/CDCA ratio in the 5 PEBD subjects ranged from 0.9 – 19.5 (median 6.9), whereas in the 5 LTX subjects it ranged from 0.5 – 2.6 (median 1.3), p = 0.117. These data suggest that PEBD results in a change in the bile acid pool composition to one that is at least as hydrophilic as produced by LTX and far more hydrophilic than in PFIC patients without treatment. The stomal bile outputs of CA and CDCA in PEBD subjects over the 72-hour study period are provided in Table 3. Daily stomal bile output in these subjects varied greatly, from 114 to 743 ml. The baseline concentration of CA in bile varied from 4.0 to 15.4mM and CDCA from 0.6 to 8.9mM. In every case bile contained more CA than CDCA. Bile from only one subject (#4, PFIC-U) contained measurable amounts of deoxycholic acid (approximately 1% of bile acid output). It is reasonable to conclude that the output of CA and CDCA contributes a large proportion of daily bile acid loss and thus should account for the bulk of bile acid synthesis at steady state. We compared the loss in bile to the synthesis rates computed from the isotope dilution studies to assess these conclusions and the accuracy of the computed values (Table 4). While both synthesis rates and timed outputs of CA and CDCA varied greatly among PEBD subjects, synthesis rates correlated well with timed output for both CA: r2 = 0.760, p = 0.024 and CDCA: r2 = 0.690, p = 0.021. These results validate measurement of bile acid synthesis rates computed from isotope dilution in subjects with large ongoing bile acid losses.",1414
26678486,"Introduction Cholestatic disorders are among the most severe liver diseases in infancy and childhood. Cholestasis is defined as an impairment of normal bile flow and is divided into extra-hepatic cholestasis and intra-hepatic cholestasis, the latter can be of hepatocanalicular or ductal origin. Familial intrahepatic cholestases (FICs) are a spectrum of autosomal liver disorders and the two ends are: benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). The differentiation between BRIC and PFIC is based on phenotypic presentation: BRIC is characterized by intermittent recurrent cholestatic episodes, with irresistible pruritus, mostly without evident liver damage. PFIC is progressive with evolution to end-stage liver disease, occurring in 1/50,000-1/100,000 births. BRICs and PFICs are differentiated as follows: BRIC1 and PFIC1 due to mutations in ATP8B1 [OMIM 602397], BRIC2 and PFIC2 due to mutations in ABCB11 [OMIM 603201] and BRIC3 and PFIC3 due to mutations in ABCB4 [OMIM 171060]. The three types of PFIC have distinctive clinical, biochemical and histological features. PFIC1 or Byler disease [OMIM211600] and PFIC2 or bile salt export pump (BSEP) disease [OMIM601847] are associated with a low or normal serum gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT) activity, whereas PFIC3 or multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3) disease [OMIM 171060] is associated with a high serum GGT activity. All three genes encode hepatocanalicular transporters: ATP8B1 encodes an amino-phospholipid flippase translocating phospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane; ABCB11 encodes the bile salt export pump, a liver-specific adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter; ABCB4 encodes the multidrug resistance protein 3 functioning as a phospholipid floppase translocating phosphatidylcoline from the inner to the outer leaflet of the membrane. FICs are present worldwide; there is no specific genotype/phenotype correlation and new mutations are continuously reported. The aim of the present study is to report novel mutations and their pathogenetic role and to highlight unusual modes of transmission of FICs observed in a series of 27 patients, thus allowing a correct diagnosis and familial counseling. Results IHC and Molecular Results Patients were classified according to immunohistochemical and molecular results (Table 2). Genomic DNA sequence analysis for FIC-associated genes identified 27 patients; 11 new mutations amongst the 34 found (32%). Seven of the patients had mutations in ATP8B1, 17 in ABCB11 and 3 in ABCB4, representing 26%, 63% and 11% respectively. Fourteen patients (52%) were transplanted, one was treated with partial external biliary diversion and one died from PFIC-related end-stage liver failure. FIC1 cases FIC1 mutations were identified in 7 (26%) of the 27 patients. Sequence analysis revealed 10 different mutations; three were novel (Table 2). Case 3, homozygous for the nonsense mutation p.R930X, died due to end-stage liver failure while waiting for LT. For the three subsequent pregnancies prenatal molecular diagnosis were done. Case 4 presented severe liver failure and underwent liver transplantation. A prenatal molecular diagnosis was provided for the next pregnancy. In case 7 sequence analysis revealed a homozygosity for p.M320VfsX13; segregation in parental DNA showed the same mutation in the father and wild type condition in the mother. To verify the presence of a deletion we performed a qPCR that revealed a 2Mb deletion (5’UTR- exon 18) in the mother and in the proband. FIC2 cases FIC2 mutations were identified in 17 (63%) of the 27 patients. Sequence analysis revealed 20 different mutations 7 of which were novel (Table 2). IHC with anti-BSEP showed absence of canalicular label in all cases out 3, while MDR3 expression was preserved. Patient 8 presented intermittent jaundice since the age of 1 month and liver biopsies at 11 and 16 years showed normal liver architecture and mild signs of intrahepatic cholestasis (Fig 1A). IHC with anti-BSEP showed mild and focal label at the canalicular membrane, in contrast to the control liver (data not shown). Genetic analysis identified a compound heterozygosity: p.E135K (BRIC mutation) and p.L1099LfsX38 (new PFIC mutation). Case 9 suffered from intractable pruritus and jaundice since 5 months of age and liver biopsies obtained at 1, 2, 5 and 6 years displayed a progression of cholestasis and bridging fibrosis (Fig 1B, 1C and 1E). IHC showed normal anti-BSEP canalicular staining (Fig 1D). Genotyping showed the p.R1050C BRIC and p.R1153H PFIC mutations. At the age of 6 years, the patient was treated with partial external biliary diversion (cholecystojejunostomy) allowing discharge of bile and disappearance of the pruritus. In case 10, sequence analysis revealed homozygosity for p.R832C; segregation in parental DNA showed the presence of uniparental disomy in the child. Case 11 was a compound heterozygote for p.A570T and p.I669V, the latter being a novel mutation, and underwent LT. A prenatal molecular diagnosis was done for the next pregnancy. Case 16, homozygous for the novel mutation p.H609HfsX46, underwent liver transplantation. In the explanted cirrhotic liver a 3cm nodule was identified. On histology the nodule corresponded to a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). IHC with anti-BSEP did not show staining either in the cirrhotic liver or in the HCC (data not shown). In case 17 DNA sequencing revealed two novel mutations. Segregation analysis, carried out in her parents, revealed two mutations, one inherited from the mother (p.H615R) and the other being a de novo. FIC3 cases FIC3 mutations were identified in three (11%) of the 27 patients (Table 2). Sequence analysis revealed four different mutations one of which were new. IHC with anti-MDR3 showed absence of canalicular label while BSEP expression was normal. Two patients underwent to LT Prediction of Functional Consequences of Variants The three new mutations in ATP8B1 (del5'UTR-ex18, p.M320VfsX13 and p.W1095X) led to the total or partial loss of the protein. The p.E135K mutation has been reported to produce mature BSEP with some reduction in the protein levels. According to the homology model (Fig 2) Glu 135 is located in a helical extracellular region with the side chain fully solvent exposed. Despite the E135K amino acid change produces a reversal of electrostatic charge, it maintains similar helix formation propensity and should not produce important structural changes. However, the E135K mutation might influence the N-glycosylation of the nearby asparagines 109, 116, 122, and 125 that have been reported to undergo this post-translational modification. This could explain the slight reduction observed in the BSEP levels, as proper glycosylation patterns are required for the stability, intracellular trafficking, and function of the protein in the apical membrane. The p.A570V mutation in ABCB11 introduces steric hindrance that interferes with the packing of three helices formed by residues 512–519, 525–534, and 561–575 in the first ABC transporter domain; p.S1027R replaces a serine with an arginine residue in a transmembrane helix, influencing electrostatic properties and the packing of this helix with adjacent transmembrane helices. p.H609HfsX46 and p.T625NfsX5 mutations produce loss of the C-terminal part of the first ABC transporter domain, the second ABC transmembrane domain, and the second ABC transporter domain. The mutation p.K930EfsX49 causes loss of an important part of the last 2 transmembrane domains and the loss of the second ABC transporter domain. Analysis of the effects of p.R1050C mutation revealed an important reduction in BSEP levels and activity. The p.L1099LfsX38 mutation causes loss of most of the residues forming the second ABC transporter domain (Fig 2), thereby abolishing the protein function. The c.3458G>A (p.R1153H) mutation of ABCB11 produces severe splicing alteration resulting in only 3% of wild-type-like splicing product. In a patient carrying the homozygote p.R1153H mutation BSEP protein was not detected. Homology modeling of ABCB4 suggests that the single new mutation p.L481R disrupts a hydrophobic pocket that destabilizes the first ABC transporter domain (S1 Model).",1237

27114171,"The bile salt export pump BSEP (gene symbol: ABCB11) belongs to subfamily B (MDR/TAP) of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. BSEP is exclusively localised at the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes and mediates bile salt-dependent bile flow by transporting bile salts from the hepatocyte into the bile canaliculus, where bile salts form mixed micelles together with cholesterol and phospholipids. Human BSEP is composed of 1321 amino acids encoded by the ABCB11 gene, which is located on chromosome 2 (2q24) and consists of a leading non-coding and 27 coding exons. BSEP mutations are the basis of cholestatic liver diseases of varying severity ranging from milder forms as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) or benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (BRIC-2) to progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC-2) often resulting in end-stage liver disease in early childhood necessitating liver transplantation. More than 290 genetic variants of BSEP are known and about 150 mutations were identified to be associated with PFIC-2 including missense mutations, deletions, insertions, frameshift and nonsense mutations with premature termination codons (PTCs) as well as splice-site mutations (for review see). Donor and acceptor splice-sites specify exon boundaries, which are not only defined by the GT-AG rule, with GT at the 5′ end and AG at the 3′ end of an intron, but also by consensus sequences where the first six intronic positions of the donor splice-site are mostly GT(A/G)AGT. Most influencing splice-site mutations concern +1/+2 (GT) or −1/−2 (AG) intron positions. Nevertheless, more distal nucleotide exchanges within the consensus sequences are also known to be relevant. The putative splice-site mutation c.150 + 3A > C (“c.” for “coding DNA”) shown in two patients with a PFIC-2 phenotype leads to an exchange of adenine to cytosine at the third intron position downstream to ABCB11 coding exon 3. In the present study, the impact of this more distally located ABCB11 donor splice-site mutation was proven not only in cultured cells by a minigene splicing assay but also by messenger RNA (mRNA) analyses from liver tissue of two patients with PFIC-2 phenotypes. Results Genetic analysis Male child 1 was liver transplanted at the age of 3 due to progressive cholestatic liver disease with normal gamma-glutamyltransferase (gGT) levels. BSEP disease/PFIC-2 was considered, and sequencing of ABCB11 revealed a heterozygous duplication of five nucleotides (GAGAT) in coding exon 21 (c.2783_2787dup5) (Fig. 1). This mutation, inherited by the father, causes a frameshift and a premature termination codon (PTC) after 78 altered codons (p.K930Efs79X; “p.” for “protein sequence”). Furthermore, the heterozygous intronic mutation c.150 + 3A > C (Fig. 1; transmitted by the mother) concerning the donor splice-site of coding exon 3 was found in addition to two frequent polymorphisms (p.V444A and p.A1028A) and five more intronic variants further away from the splice-sites. All detected BSEP variants of both children are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Child 2 (male) presented with pruritus, fatigue and elevated bile salt concentrations at 2.5 years of age. gGT levels were always within normal ranges, therefore low gGT-PFIC was assumed. ABCB11 sequencing showed a heterozygous exchange of cytosine to thymine at position 2494 in coding exon 20 (c.2494C > T) leading to a missense mutation with arginine replaced by cysteine at amino acid position 832 (p.R832C; Fig. 1). This mutation was inherited by the mother whereas the splice-site mutation c.150 + 3A > C was inherited by the father (Fig. 1). Additionally, p.V444A and p.A1028A as well as four other intronic variants in a distance ≥15 nucleotides from the splice-sites were detected (Supplementary Table S1). Child 2 was listed for liver transplantation but was removed from the list two years later because cholestasis was effectively controlled by budesonide. In silico analysis The intrinsic strength of the exon 3 splice donor and its mutation c.150 + 3A > C was calculated in silico. Wildtype sequence analysis by Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/splice.html) resulted in 0.41 (possible values: 0 to 1) indicating a weak donor splice-site per se. It was no longer recognised in presence of c.150 + 3A > C, suggesting that this mutation leads to a disruption of this splice-site. In line with this, the cytosine at the third intron position was predicted to cause aberrant splicing with high probability according to HBond score algorithm (http://uni-duesseldorf.de/rna/index.php). Splicing analysis by a minigene assay To analyse splicing outcome of c.150 + 3A > C, BSEP exon 3 and flanking intron regions with or without the nucleotide exchange (A > C) were cloned into a heterologous splicing reporter pHSR. After transient transfection into HepG2 or HEK293 cells, RNA extraction, reverse transcription and PCR were performed. Separation by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2) resulted in a product of about 165 bp from cells transfected with the parental minigene pHSR. Insertion of BSEP exon 3 led to a shift of plus ∼50 bp indicating that splice-sites were correctly recognised. In contrast, in presence of c.150 + 3A > C the shift was missing and the PCR product had the same size as seen for cells transfected with the empty minigene (Fig. 2). Sequencing revealed that both 165 bp products consist only of the amplified first two minigene exons whereas the larger product additionally contains 52 bp of inserted BSEP exon 3. In conclusion, the minigene assay indicates that BSEP c.150 + 3A > C leads to complete exon-skipping in vitro. The original uncropped gel is available as Supplementary Fig. S1. RNA analysis in human liver tissue For analysis of the patient’s liver tissue, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue of the explanted liver was used in case of child 1 whereas for child 2, a snap frozen liver biopsy was available. gDNA and RNA were isolated from liver tissue of child 1. The splice-site mutation as well as the duplication, located on different alleles, was verified on gDNA level (Fig. 3a). However, c.2783_2787dup5 was not detectable on mRNA level (Fig. 3b,c) strongly suggesting that mRNA transcripts from the affiliated allele are completely degraded. The duplication results in a premature termination codon (PTC) in exon 22, therefore, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is the most likely mechanism of mRNA degradation. As a consequence, all proven BSEP mRNA transcripts must arise from the allele carrying the splice-site mutation, either excluding (Fig. 3b) or including (Fig. 3c) exon 3. The use of specific PCR forward primers made it possible to distinguish mRNA transcripts with or without exon 3. In order to quantify the amounts of mRNA transcripts including or excluding exon 3, the relevant area was sequenced for the patients’ liver tissues and 14 normal human liver samples. Reverse sequencing starting from exon 4 towards exon 1 (displayed as reverse complement sequence; Fig. 4) is depicted to avoid an additional overlap due to an insertion in isoform BSEP-B. All control samples showed clear signals of exon 4, 3, and 2. In contrast, BSEP mRNA of child 1 and child 2 revealed an overlapping sequence composed of exon 2 and 3. The relative distribution of mRNA transcripts including and excluding exon 3 was calculated. Peak areas for each nucleotide of the overlap were matched and revealed for child 1 that skipping due to c.150 + 3A > C was observed in 63.1 ± 8.2% of transcripts (upper white bar, Fig. 4). Providing that detectable BSEP mRNA of child 1 entirely originates from the allele containing the splice-site mutation, it can be concluded that exon 3 is only partially skipped in the presence of c.150 + 3A > C in the patient’s liver tissue. Furthermore, liver-specific mRNA sequencing of child 2 revealed that exon 3 is skipped in 37.1 ± 7.7% of transcripts (lower white bar, Fig. 4). In contrast to child 1, mRNA transcripts of both alleles of child 2 were included. The second mutation c.2494C > T (p.R832C) of child 2 does not affect mRNA processing. Based on the missense mutation p.R832C, it was possible to distinguish the patient’s alleles and to further prove exon-skipping in another approach (Fig. 5). Two different specific forward primers were combined with a reverse primer covering position c.2494 of the nucleotide exchange C > T in exon 20. Primer ex2/4 is complementary to the exon transition of exon 2 and 4 in case of skipped exon 3 whereas primer ex3 only binds when this exon is present. In the setting with a skipped exon 3, cytosine (C) from the wildtype sequence was almost exclusively found in exon 20 at position c.2494, whereas thymine (T) appears only to a very small amount (Fig. 5a). The ratio of peak areas (C/T) was 22/1, indicating that exon-skipping predominantly affects the allele containing the splice-site mutation. On the contrary, when exon 3 was present, the T peak was higher at c.2494 than the C peak (Fig. 5b) with a ratio of 2/1 (T/C). In summary, correctly spliced mRNA transcripts of child 2 arose not only from the maternal allele carrying c.2494C > T but also to some extent from the paternal allele despite the splice-site mutation (Fig. 4, lower panel, Fig. 5b). BSEP protein expression In normal human liver tissue BSEP and the bilirubin transporter MRP2 co-localise within the canalicular membrane and show a distinct immunoreactivity. Although to a lesser extent, BSEP was detectable in livers of both children co-localising with MRP2 (Fig. 6). In child 1, c.2783_2787dup5 excludes protein expression because BSEP mRNA transcripts from the affiliated allele were not observable (Fig. 3b,c). Therefore, detection of canalicular BSEP expression in child 1 confirms that mRNA splicing and processing from the allele with the splice-site mutation works properly to some extent.",1525
29084231,"Introduction Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of common (MAF>0.05) variants associated with conventional lipid and lipoprotein traits: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG). While some low-frequency (0.005<MAF≤0.05) and rare variants (MAF≤0.005) have been associated with lipid and lipoprotein traits, additional loci remain to be identified. High-throughput proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based measurements of lipid and lipoprotein subclasses provide a more comprehensive view of particle size and composition than conventional blood lipid profile measurements, and these expanded sets of traits have been associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. For example, HDL subclasses are differentially associated with incidence of coronary heart disease, and VLDL particle size is negatively associated with mortality. Previous association studies for lipid traits have identified several genomic regions of <1 Mb that contain more than one association signal for which the lead variants are not in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2<0.8). Fine-mapping with higher density variants and conditional analyses can determine which signals are distinct (remain significant after conditional analysis) and which are independent, which we define here as r2<0.01. For example, Teslovich et al. used conditional analysis at 95 lipid loci to identify 26 loci that harbor at least two distinct association signals. Association signals at the same locus can be population-specific or shared across populations, with potentially different effect sizes and/or lead variants. Multiple association signals at a locus may indicate allelic heterogeneity in gene function or regulation or that more than one gene at the locus affects the trait. Furthermore, identifying and accounting for additional independent association signals increases the variance in traits that can be explained by genetic loci. In this study, we performed genome-wide single-variant and gene-based association analyses of 68 NMR lipid and lipoprotein subclass traits and four conventional traits (TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C) in 8,372 non-diabetic Finnish men from the METabolic Syndrome In Men (METSIM) study. To identify novel associations, we performed analyses with and without conditioning on lipid-associated variants at loci previously described in array- and sequence-based GWAs. We identified the most strongly associated lipid and lipoprotein subclass traits at established loci for conventional lipid and lipoprotein traits. Since several subclasses are associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, identifying the variants that influence these traits is the first step to develop novel clinical treatments. These expanded association results have the potential to lead to advances in determining the etiological role of the variants and genes in cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Results Genome-wide association study To identify genetic variants associated with the 72 lipid and lipoprotein traits, we analyzed 15.1M genotyped and imputed variants in 8,372 non-diabetic Finnish men (S1 Table, S1 Fig). Each trait was adjusted for age, age2, lipid-lowering medication use, and smoking status. Inverse normalized trait residuals were tested for association with each variant assuming additive allelic effects using a linear mixed model to account for relatedness among study participants. Many of the traits are highly correlated with each other, with 104 trait-pair comparisons having a pairwise Pearson correlation greater than 0.98 (S2 Fig). We used a genome-wide significance threshold of P≤5×10−8, consistent with previous association studies of this scale and high trait correlation. We note where associations meet a conservative experiment-wide Bonferonni-corrected P-value (P≤4.6×10−11). We identified 32,524 variant-trait associations (Pdiscovery<5×10−8) for the 72 lipid and lipoprotein traits (S3 Fig). 30,348 (93%) of the 32,524 associations were for one of the 68 subclass traits and 2,176 (7%) for one of the four conventional lipid traits (TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C). More than half the associations were with the VLDL- (38%) or HDL-subclass (29%) traits. 3,784 unique variants comprise the total 32,524 trait-variant associations (S2 Table). 73% (2,780) of the 3,784 variants had a greater association with one of the 68 subclass traits, and 27% (1,004) were more highly associated with at least one of the four conventional traits (S2 Table). These variants cluster into 42 loci that were associated with at least one of the 72 traits (S1 Table). For example, at the well-characterized APOA5 locus on chromosome 11, rs964184 was significantly associated (Pdiscovery<5×10−8) with 43 of the 72 lipid and lipoprotein traits. At CETP, rs12446515 was significantly associated with 34 of the 72 traits. For such loci, the high correlation between the traits obscures identification of a causal trait underlying the signal. Conditional analyses to identify novel loci and signals To identify novel associations not reported previously for any conventional or subclass lipid or lipoprotein trait, we identified and curated a list of previously known associated variants to use in genome-wide conditional analyses (Methods). We identified 1,714 variants (S3 Table) that we clustered based on stringent LD (r2>0.95) into 885 representative variants (S4 Table). After genome-wide conditional analysis using these 885 variants, we defined novel association signals using a significance threshold of Pconditional<5×10−8 (S5 Table). Consistent with highly correlated traits, we observed that most of the associated variants were associated with multiple correlated traits. We considered variants located within 1 Mb of an established lipid or lipoprotein signal to be an additional signal in the region, and we define a locus as the region 1 Mb up- and downstream of a signal. We considered additional signals independent if the signal was not in LD (r2<0.01) with known lipid/lipoprotein signals, and remained significant (Psingle<5×10−8) after single-variant conditional analyses. Associated variants with MAF<0.01 were validated by direct genotyping or sequencing (see Methods). Using this genome-wide conditional approach, we identified five novel signals near established lipid and lipoprotein loci (Table 1). One novel common variant signal at HIF3A Common variant rs73059724 (MAF = 0.09), associated with decreased (β = –0.14) concentrations of phospholipids in small VLDL, is located 3.5 kb upstream of HIF3A (hypoxia inducible factor 3, alpha subunit) and 1.4 Mb from APOE (S4A and S5A Figs). Additionally, this signal is associated with decreased VLDL subclass traits (S6 Fig). This signal achieved significance after conditioning on known lipid GWAS variants (Pdiscovery = 3.8×10−7, Pconditional = 1.4×10−8) (Table 1, S6 Table). When adjusted for total triglycerides, the strength of the association of rs73059724 with phospholipids in small VLDL was reduced (P = 3.6×10−2, S7 Table). This signal is located in a gene-dense region on chromosome 19 that includes 10 previously reported lipoprotein-associated variants within 1 Mb of the index variant (S6 Table); none of these variants exhibited LD (r2>0.02) with rs73059724. Further analysis of the APOE locus with additional samples may be necessary to elucidate the haplotype relationships between these signals. Twenty-nine proxy variants in LD (r2>0.7) with rs73059724 span a 25-kb region including the promoter and intron 1 of HIF3A, and five of these variants overlap ≥5 liver and adipose regulatory element (histone marks of transcriptional regulation and open chromatin) datasets (S8 Table). Hyper-methylation at HIF3A is associated with increased adiposity and BMI in Asian infants and children. HIF3A is a known negative regulator of HIF1A (hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit), which has been shown to regulate the cellular uptake of cholesterol esters and VLDL by creating hypoxic conditions. One or more of the associated variants may affect HIF3A transcription or other genes in the region, leading to fewer phospholipids in small VLDL particles. Two novel low-frequency variant signals at ALB and SYS1 We identified two new signals with low-frequency variants located near ALB and SYS1 (Table 1, S4B and S5B Figs). At the ALB locus, the low-frequency allele of rs187918276 (MAF = 0.017) located in intron 1 of ANKRD17 was associated with increased (β = 0.60) concentration of small LDL particles (Pdiscovery = 6.3×10−22, Pconditional = 3.2×10−11) and 26 additional traits, including increased TC, LDL-C, esterified cholesterol, free cholesterol, and IDL/LDL/VLDL subclasses (S6 Fig). When adjusted for total cholesterol, the strength of the association of rs187918276 with small LDL particles was reduced (P = 9.1×10−7, S7 Table). Variants in LD (r2>0.7, METSIM) with this variant span >1.2 Mb (S5B Fig, S8 Table), consistent with long haplotypes previously described in Finns. The 885 variants used for the conditional analysis included established TC-associated signals at rs60873279 and rs182616603, located 337 kb and 1 Mb away; these variants exhibited low (r2<0.01) and moderate (r2 = 0.39) pairwise LD with rs187918276 (S6 Table). When conditioned on rs182616603, the association with rs187918276 was reduced but still highly significant (Psingle = 5×10−15), suggesting the signals are distinct. An additional variant at this locus, rs115136538, was reported previously to be associated with albumin levels. rs115136538 is located 710 kb away from and is not in LD with rs187918276 (r2<0.01 in METSIM), and the association of rs187918276 with small LDL particles was essentially unchanged when conditioned on rs115136538 (S6 Table). Taken together, the ALB region contains three distinct signals for lipid traits (rs60873279, rs182616603, and now rs187918276). ALB encodes albumin, which is responsible for shuttling cholesterol in the blood to the lipoprotein particle acceptors; deletion of Alb in mice led to a hyperlipidemic condition. One of the 12 variants in LD (r2>0.7) with rs187918276, chr4:74265673, is located 4.3 kb upstream of the ALB transcription start site (TSS), and is the only variant that overlapped any epigenomic marks of transcriptional regulation from the adipose, blood, and liver datasets (S8 Table). This variant may mediate a regulatory effect on ALB to increase the plasma concentration of small LDL particles, or another of the candidate variants spanning 1.2 Mb may act on this or another nearby gene. In an intergenic region downstream of PIGT, we identified the low-frequency allele of lead variant rs184392658 (MAF = 0.008) associated with the increased (β = 0.45) concentration of large HDL particles (Pdiscovery = 2.3×10−7, Pconditional = 2.5×10−9, Table 1, S4C Fig and S5C Fig). When adjusted for HDL-C, the association of rs184392658 with large HDL particles was reduced (P = 4.1×10−5, S7 Table). Two previously established lipid-associated variants are located within 1 Mb of rs184392658: rs1800961 near HNF4A and rs6065904 near PLTP. rs184392658 was not in LD (r2<0.015) with either of these established variants, and conditioning on the individual known variants did not substantially change the association signal (all Psingle<3.7×10−6, S6 Table). Thus, rs184392658 represents a new distinct signal in this region. Of six variants in high LD (r2>0.7) with lead variant rs184392658, only rs149985455 overlaps multiple epigenomic marks of transcription regulation from liver, blood, and adipose tissue datasets (S8 Table). This variant is located 2.2 kb upstream from SYS1 (Sys1 Golgi trafficking protein), which may have a role in lipid metabolism through an interaction with GTPases. SYS1 targets ARFRP1 (ADP-ribosylation factor-related protein 1) and forms a complex in the Golgi membrane; deletion of Arfrp1 in mouse adipocytes led to lipodystrophy caused by failure in lipid droplet formation. rs149985455 may mediate a regulatory effect on SYS1 to increase the plasma concentration of large HDL particles, or another of the candidate variants spanning >500 kb may act on this or another nearby gene. Two novel rare variant signals at LCAT and LIPG We identified additional novel independent signals with rare variants near LCAT and LIPG (Table 1). The rare allele (MAF = 0.005) of the missense variant rs199717050 (Arg123His) in exon 3 of LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase) was associated with decreased (β = –0.72) HDL-C levels (Pdiscovery = 5.9×10−10, Pconditional = 2.5×10−12, Table 1, S4D Fig and S5D Fig). This signal was not significantly associated with any of the HDL subclass traits or other traits from this study (S6 Fig). The association of rs199717050 with HDL-C was nominally reduced (P = 2.9×10−8) when adjusted for total cholesterol (S7 Table). Six variants at this locus, within 1 Mb of rs199717050, were reported previously to be associated with HDL-C (S6 Table). However, these six variants all show low pairwise LD with rs199717050 (r2<0.01), and single-variant conditional analyses using any one of the six variants did not substantially change the association of rs199717050 with HDL-C (Psingle ≤1.9×10−9, S6 Table). rs199717050 may be nearly specific to Finns; the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database shows a total allele count of 16: fifteen in Finns and one in a non-European population. LCAT is responsible for cholesterol esterification for eventual transfer into the lipoprotein core, and facilitates the transport of cholesterol into the liver. rs199717050 is predicted to be deleterious (SIFT, 0.02) or possibly damaging (PolyPhen, 0.55), consistent with a plausible functional effect on LCAT to decrease levels of HDL-C. Another novel signal was located at the well-established HDL-C-associated LIPG locus (Fig 1). The rare allele (MAF = 0.004) of lead variant rs538509310 is located 3.6 kb upstream from ACAA2, and was most strongly associated with increased (β = 0.72) levels of phospholipids in medium-size HDL (Pdiscovery = 1.7×10−9, Pconditional = 3.2×10−10, Table 1, Fig 1A and 1B). This signal was also significantly associated with increased levels of four other HDL subclass traits and apolipoprotein A-I (S6 Fig). When adjusted for HDL-C, the association of rs538509310 with phospholipids in medium-size HDL was reduced (P = 4.5×10−5) (S7 Table). rs538509310 is in near complete LD (r2 = 0.98) with rs201922257, which encodes a missense substitution (Ala172Val) in exon 4 of LIPG. At least four previously described HDL-C variant association signals are located within 1 Mb of this variant, including rs74558535 (P = 2×10−10), rs10438978 (P = 7.7×10−36), rs77960347 (P = 3.6×10−11), and rs2156552 (P = 2×10−12). The new signal is not in LD (r2<0.043) with the previously described variants and remained significant after single-variant conditional analyses (S6 Table, Fig 1C). LIPG encodes endothelial lipase (EL), which catalyzes HDL phospholipids and aids in the sequestration of HDL from circulation, and is expressed in several tissues and organs including the liver. The association with phospholipids in medium-size HDL is consistent with the known phospholipase of EL. Several variants in LIPG have been shown to decrease endothelial lipase levels and increase HDL-C. Based on the direction of effect in these previous studies, missense variant (A172V) may decrease function of LIPG, leading to increased phospholipids in medium-size HDL and other HDL subclasses. Gene-based tests of association To test the association between lipid and lipoprotein subclasses and sets of coding variants within a gene, we performed gene-based tests of association using SKAT-O with four variant masks (Methods) based on the predicted function of the coding variants. Sets of variants in LIPC (Pgene = 7.1×10−11) and LIPG (Pgene = 3.8×10−17) were associated with lipid and lipoprotein subclasses using the gene-based method; these results remained significant after adjusting for nearby noncoding signals (LIPC P<1.3×10−10 and LIPG P<1.2×10−17) (Fig 2, S9 Table). At LIPC, the set of five rare missense variants, R138C, A145T, R208H, R281Q, and R329H, showed the strongest association using the protein truncating variant (PTV)+missense mask with triglycerides in very large HDL (Fig 2A, Pgene = 7.1×10−11). Of the five single-variant tests of association with triglycerides in very large HDL, A145T was individually the most significant (Pdiscovery = 5.3×10−8). Four of the variants (R138C, A145T, R208H, and R281Q) showed higher trait levels (β = 0.72 to 1.8) and were predicted to be deleterious by Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), while R329H, observed in one individual, showed a modestly lower trait level (β = –0.24) and was predicted to be benign. While rare, A145T had 1.7-fold higher allele frequency in Finns (0.003%) than other populations. Three of the variants, A145T, R138C, and R208H, were associated with increased HDL-C in a previous gene-based association study, consistent with our results. Among the other variants, the relatively high trait values for R281Q suggest that it may also increase HDL-C. Based on previous data that decreased LIPC expression can result in increased large HDL levels, the rare alleles may lead to reduced LIPC function. Consistent with the gene-based test, deficiency in hepatic lipase activity resulted in increased concentration of triglycerides in plasma HDL. At LIPG, the PTV+missense mask showed five variants with the strongest association with phospholipids in medium-size HDL (Fig 2B, Pgene = 3.8×10−17). Of the five single-variant tests, a rare missense (A172V) variant rs201922257 was the only one significantly associated (Pdiscovery = 8.6×10−9) with the subclass trait, and in three of four transcripts the amino acid substitution is predicted by VEP to be ‘deleterious’ and ‘probably damaging’ in most of the transcripts (Fig 2B). This variant is in LD (r2 = 0.98) with the non-coding index variant rs538509310 for phospholipids in medium HDL (Table 1, Fig 1A). The other associated variants may also affect LIPG function despite less-significant P-values. A splice variant rs200435657 (MAF = 0.0035, Pdiscovery = 4.0×10−6) is located at the 3’ end of intron 1; this variant has only been observed once (1/121,029; 0.0008%) in non-Finnish ExAC samples. Based on position, this splice variant is predicted to cause skipping of exon 2, which would lead to four aberrantly coded amino acids and a stop codon in exon 3. The remaining missense variants are predicted by VEP to be deleterious except for E391K. N396S and E391K have been reported previously to be associated with increased HDL-C levels. However, our data suggest that all five variants increase phospholipids in medium HDL (β = 0.01 to 0.75) (Fig 2B). Together, the gene-based tests suggest that additional rare variants may influence LIPG function and HDL-C subclass levels. Lipid and lipoprotein associations at known lipid and coronary artery disease loci We next asked whether any of 157 previously known loci associated with one or more of the four conventional lipid and lipoprotein traits exhibited stronger evidence of association with one of the lipid or lipoprotein subclass traits. Among the 157 loci associated (P<5×10−8) here with at least one subclass trait, 30 showed stronger association with a subclass trait than any conventional trait (Table 2, S7 Fig). For example, at PLTP (phospholipid transfer protein), rs4812975 was much more strongly associated with HDL diameter (Psubclass = 1.4×10−15) than with HDL-C (Pconventional = 2.6×10−3), consistent with PLTP mediating the net transfer of phospholipids between lipoproteins and uptake of phospholipids into the HDL-C core. In addition, at ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3), ANGPTL4 (angiopoietin-like 4), and LPL (lipoprotein lipase), the variants were all more strongly associated with VLDL subclass traits than with the conventional traits (Table 2), consistent with studies showing that mouse Angptl3 knockout and Angptl4 overexpression may act via Lpl to decrease or increase VLDL, respectively. At less well-characterized and gene-dense loci, lipid and lipoprotein subclass associations may help suggest target genes or biological roles. At the gene-dense MTCH2-NUP160 locus, rs4752801 was >3 log units more strongly associated with decreased free cholesterol in large HDL levels (Psubclass = 1.4×10−9) than any conventional trait (HDL-C, Pconventional = 8.2×10−6, Table 2). The pattern of association of rs4752801 with all 72 subclass traits (S7 Fig) is similar to the pattern of association and direction of effect for at least two other signals, rs737337 at ANGPTL8 and rs1129555 at GPAM. ANGPTL8 and GPAM are both regulated directly or indirectly by LXR, encoded by NR1H3, which is a positional candidate gene at this locus. Thus, the global pattern of association supports a contribution of NR1H3 at the MTCH2-NUP160 locus and suggests that the lipid and lipoprotein subclass traits can be a useful tool to help determine which genes underlie association signals. We performed a similar analysis of lipoprotein associations at coronary artery disease (CAD) loci (S10 Table). Variants at the APOA5/APOA1 locus were 5.2 log units more strongly associated with triglycerides in small VLDL than total triglycerides, and APOE/APOC1 was 2.3 log units more strongly associated with ratio of apoA-I/apoB than any conventional trait. APOA5 has been shown to affect VLDL concentrations and TG-rich particle metabolism, and the stronger association with the subclass trait is consistent with the known functions of these genes.",3231

25392597,"1. Introduction Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a kind of progressive chronic nonsuppurative cholangitis, mediated by disorder of the immune system. Pathological changes of PBC include biliary duct distraction, portal inflammation, and liver necrosis. It may cause intrahepatic bile duct injury and intrahepatic cholestasis, which finally leads to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. The incidence of PBC increased in recent years due to lifestyle changes and cognitive rise of doctors. It is thought that the morbidity of PBC is affected by environmental factors and genetic factors. Many reports showed that there was an obvious familial aggregation of PBC. The prevalence of PBC clustering in a representative family with affected patients would reach a rate of 18.1, which is much higher than that in the general population. In addition, the reported 63% concordance rate among monozygotic twins compared to the null concordance among dizygotic pairs, scoring as the highest among autoimmune diseases, indicated that gene susceptibility played an important role in the pathogenesis of PBC. Gene susceptibility loci had been widely screened by researchers worldwide, and polymorphisms of different genes seemed to be associated with the development of PBC among different populations. In the context of PBC, four genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed and included homogenous groups from Northern American, Italian, mostly Northern American, and British patients, respectively. In addition to the HLA II genes, GWAS discovered 23 non-HLA susceptibility genes for PBC. Among these, IL12A, IL12RB2, IRF5, TNPO3, DENND1B, SPIB, TNFAIP2, CXCR5, CLEC16A, RAD51L1, IRF8, RPS6KA4, MAP3K7IP1, TNFRSF1A, PLCL2, ELMO1, and ARF7 played an important role in the morbidity of PBC in European ancestries, while TNFSF15 and POU2AF1 were unique in Japanese ancestries, and CD80, IKZK3, Il7R, NFKB1, and STAT4 were proved to be associated with PBC in both races. The disparity of genes among Europeans and Asians indicated that the results of Western countries could not apply to Chinese population in haste. We carried out the overwhelming literature search to identify the possible genes that contributed to PBC susceptibility and analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for selecting genes which may participate in the pathogenesis of PBC for further research. Finally, we found SNPs in bile salt export pump (BSEP) gene were highly associated with PBC susceptibility. BSEP, an ABC transmembrane transporter (ABCB 11), was the predominant bile salt efflux system of hepatocytes and mediates the cellular excretion of numerous conjugated bile salts. In this study, we explored the association between four polymorphisms of BSEP (rs52304393, rs473351, rs860510, and rs2287618) and the susceptibility of PBC in Chinese population. Meanwhile, we analyzed the relationship between clinical indexes such as AMA, ALP, GGT, TBIL, and BSEP polymorphisms. Furthermore, the association between ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) response rate and BSEP polymorphisms was explored through logistic regression analyses. 3. Results In both PBC patient and control group, the genotypes of selected polymorphisms of BSEP were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with no significant difference (Table 2). Based on the genotypic concordance, two SNPs in BSEP gene (rs473351 and rs2287618) were detected in linkage disequilibrium (D′ > 0.9) (Figure 1). Haplotype of GG was the risk allele, which indicated that individuals carrying GG haplotype may suffer from PBC easier (Table 3). All the loci selected were analyzed in dominant, recessive, and codominant genetic models, respectively. The rs473351 locus of BSEP was associated with PBC susceptibility. Its variant of A allele (dominant model, OR = 2.063; 95% CI, 1.254–3.393; P = 0.004) was highly associated with PBC susceptibility. The rs2287618 locus provided a protective role for PBC. The frequency of the minor A allele at rs2287618 was significantly decreased (dominant model, OR = 0.617; 95% CI, 0.411–0.928; P = 0.020) in PBC patients compared with controls (Table 4). Ninety-six patients were included to analysis the relationship between clinical indexes such as AMA, ALP, GGT, and TBIL; UDCA response rate; and BSEP SNPs. Logistic regression analyses revealed that (1) the AMA-positive and AMA-negative population have a significant difference between the two groups with the rs2287618 mutation (P < 0.05). (2) The frequency of variant allele at rs2287618 was significantly associated with a high serum ALP (P = 0.04). (3) Two different evaluation criteria of UDCA response rate showed no significant difference, and the evaluation criterion of Barcelona indicated that the frequency of variant allele at rs2287618 was significantly decreased in UDCA-responsive PBC patients compared with UDCA-nonresponsive PBC patients (38.6% versus 53.4%; P = 0.021; OR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33–0.91) (Table 5).",733

24366234,"INTRODUCTION Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), also known as obstetric cholestasis, occurs in ∼1 in 150 UK pregnancies. Maternal symptoms of the disease include pruritus, raised serum bile acids, and deranged liver function tests. Liver transaminases can be increased as much as 100-fold, but the bilirubin level is usually normal or mildly raised. Fetal consequences of ICP include spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labor, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, fetal distress, and intrauterine death. Approximately 80% of patients present after 30 weeks of gestation and diagnosis is routinely confirmed by elevated serum bile acid concentrations and liver function tests. Higher levels of fasting and nonfasting serum bile acids (>40 μM) have been associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous preterm labor, meconium passage, stillbirth, and prolonged admission to the neonatal unit. Severe ICP, defined by maternal serum bile acid levels of ≥40 μM, affects 1 in 1,000 pregnancies in the United Kingdom. Treatment is usually with ursodeoxycholic acid, to which ∼70% of patients respond with improvement in maternal liver function tests, bile acids, and pruritus. It is currently not known whether ursodeoxycholic acid treatment reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, although the results of two recent studies were encouraging. The impact of ICP for the offspring was further highlighted by a recent study that reported increased rates of obesity and dyslipidemia in the 16-year-old offspring of affected women. ICP has a complex, multifactorial etiology with hormonal, environmental, and genetic influences. Considerable evidence for a genetic predisposition to this disease comes from significant familial clustering, population-specific risk differences, and increased risk with an affected first-degree relative. Genes mutated in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and the related condition benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC), namely ABCB4, ABCB11, and ATP8B1, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ICP in a number of different studies. Initial studies identified heterozygous mutations of the phosphatidyl choline floppase ABCB4 (MDR3) in familial and sporadic cases. Homozygous mutations of this gene cause a severe childhood-onset liver disease, PFIC3. These first studies of the genetics of ICP susceptibility were confirmed and expanded by a number of subsequent studies. Mutations in ABCB4 cause a number of other biliary disorders, including drug-induced cholestasis and low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis. A small single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)/haplotype study of common variation around this locus in 52 “severe” ICP cases with serum bile acid levels of >40 μM provided additional evidence for a role in ICP susceptibility. Hence, ABCB4 mutations and variation are linked to a spectrum of cholestatic disease of varying severity. ABCB11 (the bile salt export pump), another member of the ABC transporter superfamily, is the high-affinity liver-specific transporter responsible for the export of conjugated bile acids into the canaliculus. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations of this gene cause the cholestatic diseases PFIC2 and BRIC2. The role of genetic variation at this locus in ICP susceptibility has recently been explored in detail, with several recurrent mutations identified, together with the confirmation of the p.444A variant as a population susceptibility allele. Further analysis of an Italian cohort has further established ABCB11 variation as playing a role in ICP susceptibility. Acting together with ABCB4, this transporter is responsible for bile salt-dependent bile flow. The phosphatidyl choline flopped by ABCB4 complexes with bile salts exported by ABCB11 and cholesterol transported by ABCG5/G8 to form mixed micelles in the canalicular tree and protect the ductal epithelium from the detergent action of the bile salts. The involvement of another familial cholestasis gene, ATP8B1 (mutated in PFIC1/BRIC1), has not been established definitively. This protein is proposed to function as a phosphatidyl serine flippase in the canalicular membrane and has been studied to a limited extent in ICP cohorts. Furthermore, recent work has identified a functional interdependence with the ABCB4 protein. Bile salt-independent bile flow is primarily the result of another transporter, ABCC2 (MRP2 (multidrug resistance-related protein 2)), that transports bilirubin and other organic anions (including some bile acids) across the canalicular membrane. Involvement of genetic variation around ABCC2 in ICP has been reported in South American populations. The activity of the transporters responsible for bile formation is regulated by the principal bile acid sensor FXR (NR1H4), and functional variation of this receptor has been identified in ICP. FXR acts as the master regulator of bile acid homeostasis by sensing intracellular concentrations of bile acids and regulating their metabolism and transport via modulation of promoter activity in key genes. In addition, key feedback signaling from the gut is performed by fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). This is a peptide hormone released by enterocytes via FXR-mediated transcriptional activation. It downregulates hepatocyte CYP7A1 activity (via FGFR4/β-klotho-mediated transduction) and hence bile acid synthesis and is vital in controlling appropriate levels of hepatic FXR activity. In addition to ABCB4 and ABCB11, these other loci represent biologically plausible candidates for a role in ICP susceptibility. Of note, a number of small studies in a variety of populations have examined other loci postulated to play a role in ICP susceptibility (reviewed in Dixon and Williamson without providing definitive evidence of involvement. Although several of the genes have already been demonstrated to play a role in ICP in Caucasians (ABCB4, ABCB11, and NR1H4), there is still a paucity of information concerning the contribution of other key genes (ABCC2, ATP8B1, and FGF19) in the etiology of ICP. In order to clarify and expand the genetic factors known to play a role in ICP, we sought to investigate the common variation around the six candidate loci described above in a large ICP cohort and further investigate these findings in a second cohort. RESULTS In total, 78 markers passed quality control and Hardy–Weinberg testing and were used in association analysis of the two cohorts. Association analysis with the Armitage trend test identified six SNPs in ABCB11 together with six SNPs in ABCB4 showing significant evidence for association ( Table 1). The strongest association signals were seen with rs2109505 in ABCB4 and with rs7577650 in ABCB11. No SNPs from the other four loci showed evidence of association (Supplementary Table S1). The data set was investigated further by haplotype analysis across each of the six loci, which identified significant differences in frequencies between cases and controls for ABCB11 and ABCB4. No other significant differences in haplotype frequencies across the other loci (ABCC2, ATP8B1, NR1H4, and FGF19) were identified (Supplementary Table S2). ABCB11 HapMap analysis identified 23 tagging polymorphisms that passed quality control. Association analysis of these markers subsequent to genotyping identified six markers significantly associated with altered risk for ICP: rs228762, rs2058996, rs7605199, rs3815676, rs3814382, and rs7577650 ( Table 1). The most strongly associated marker was rs7577650 (trend test corrected P=1.8×10−4). ABCB4 HapMap analysis identified 14 polymorphisms that passed quality control. Association analysis of these markers subsequent to genotyping identified six markers significantly associated with altered risk for ICP: rs2097937, rs31676, rs1149222, rs4148826, rs2109505, and rs2302386 ( Table 1). The most strongly associated marker was rs2109505 (P=4.6×10−7). ABCC2, ATP8B1, NR1H4, and FGF19 Around these loci, HapMap analysis identified 41 polymorphisms but none showed significant evidence for association in our cohort (Supplementary Table S1). The previously reported ABCC2 association was not detected in this cohort. Haplotype analysis The data set was investigated further by haplotype analysis across all six loci (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3a and b). Significant differences were identified in haplotype distributions between cases and controls for ABCB11 (global corrected P value 0.02) and ABCB4 (global corrected P value 5.76×10−5). Conditional analysis of association and second cohort analysis Heat maps were generated using conditional analysis with logistic regression to visualize the patterns of evidence for association across the locus. This analysis showed that the association signal in ABCB4 was explained by the SNP rs2109505, with no evidence for further signals ((P>0.05; Figure 1). This is shown in the diagram by the red horizontal signal for this SNP (i.e., significant evidence for association regardless of which other SNPs are corrected for) and the white column (“corrected for”) for this SNP, indicating no other significant signal when the effect of this SNP is corrected for. In contrast, analysis of the associated SNPs in ABCB11 identified evidence for two independent signals, at the SNPs rs3815676 and 7577650: each remains significant (P<10−4) correcting for the other, or any other SNP at this locus (Figure 2). In the heat map, the strong red color again indicates evidence for association, but in this case the “corrected for” column shows evidence of the second signal, indicated by the darker red block. The key SNPs identified by this analysis were genotyped in the second cohort. Using the controls from the first cohort for comparison, the association with each SNP was confirmed and when analyzed together the combined cohort indicated strong evidence for association ( Table 2). The odds ratios calculated for the trend tests are allelic and, as ICP is rare, are approximately equivalent to the corresponding relative risk. Thus, for the association with rs3825676 (a rare SNP compared with the majority studied), the odds ratio indicate a risk of ICP that is 3.79 times higher in the homozygote than the heterozygote (with a corresponding reduction in risk in the other homozygote genotype.). For the other SNPs analyzed using this test, the same principle applies. Hence, for the much commoner SNP rs7577650, the homozygotes have a 1.4 times change in risk for ICP, and for rs2109505 in ABCB4 (again a much commoner SNP), the odds ratio shows a change in risk of 2.06-fold.",1558
20010382,"Introduction Bile formation and secretion are a critical function of mammalian liver and essential for enabling a number of physiologic functions such as intestinal digestion and absorption of lipids, elimination of toxins, carcinogens, drugs and other xenobiotic compounds, and excretion of endobiotics like cholesterol, bilirubin, and hormones. Bile acids, synthesized from the enzymatic catabolism of cholesterol, are the major solutes in bile, essential for the maintenance of bile flow and biliary lipid secretion. In fact, the vectorial excretion of bile salts from blood into bile, also known as bile salt-dependent bile flow, represents the major driving force for bile flow. Bile secretion across the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes represents the rate-limiting step in bile formation and consists primarily of active transport mechanisms driven by ATP hydrolysis as biliary constituents are often translocated against steep concentration gradients in the range of 100–1000-fold. The efficient biliary excretion of monovalent bile acids across the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte is mediated by the bile salt export pump (BSEP; ABCB11), an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transmembrane transporter. Originally identified from pig liver partial cDNA sequence, BSEP had been initially named sister of P-glycoprotein (Spgp) because of its homology to P-gp (50% sequence identity). Based on this sequence, a full-length homolog of Spgp was cloned from rat liver. In membrane vesicles from transfected insectderived Sf9 cells, the rat Spgp was shown to exhibit a 5-fold stimulation of ATP-dependent taurocholate transport compared with control vesicles, indicating its true function as a bile salt transporting ABC protein. Subsequent immunogold labeling and in-situ immunofluorescence of rat liver showed selective localization of the 160λkDa protein to the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte. Accordingly, it became clear that Spgp is the major canalicular BSEP of mammalian liver and it was thus renamed BSEP. Rat BSEP is highly homologous to the human ortholog, with 82.3% sequence identity and 88% amino acid similarity. In-vitro studies evaluating human BSEP expressed in membrane vesicles confirmed bile salts to be its major substrates. Although bile salts are its primary substrates, BSEP has also been shown to transport a limited number of nonbile acid substrates, including vinblastine, calcein-AM, and pravastatin. The critical importance of BSEP to normal human hepatic function is illustrated by the progressive familial intrahepatic cholestases (PFIC), a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by progressive liver disease that typically manifest in childhood as impaired bile flow in the absence of hepatobiliary structural abnormality. Loss of function mutations in ABCB11 has been identified in patients with PFIC type 2 (PFIC2), typically resulting in absence of hepatic BSEP expression. These infants typically present with severe jaundice, hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, and pruritus. Laboratory studies show direct hyperbilirubinemia, elevated serum aminotransferases, and paradoxically normal serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase and cholesterol concentrations. Biliary bile acid concentrations are less than 1% of the normal. There is a rapid progressive course to cirrhosis and liver failure, which can only be cured by liver transplantation. Mechanisms for loss of function associated with PFIC2 mutations have been studied in vitro and include impaired trafficking of protein to the membrane, protein misfolding, loss of substrate recognition, or increased proteasomal degradation. Although complete loss of function BSEP mutations as seen with PFIC2 is very rare, more recently genetic heterogeneity has been noted in the BSEP gene with the identification of coding region polymorphisms identified from genomic DNA of ethnically diverse healthy individuals (http://www.pharmgkb.org). Several polymorphisms are common (>10% allele frequency) and, in general, allele frequencies tended to be ethnic dependent. Indeed, recent studies would suggest that additional mutations and/or polymorphisms in ABCB11 may be associated with various disease processes such as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), and risk for drug-induced cholestasis (DC). A recent study suggested aberrant splicing events and mechanisms that promote exon skipping might explain defects associated with some BSEP mutations and/or polymorphic variants. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive study of the functional relevance of naturally occurring polymorphisms in BSEP to protein function. Clearly, functionally relevant BSEP polymorphisms, if found to be present, would significantly add to our knowledge of the genetic basis of altered bile acid physiology, hepatocyte function, and risk for cholestatic disorders including drug-induced liver injury. In this study we report the systematic functional characterization of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in human BSEP. Results Single nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCB11 Ethnically identified DNA samples from the Coriell Cell Repository (Camden) were evaluated for the presence of ABCB11 polymorphisms. From approximately 250 DNA samples, a total of 24 coding region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in our screening. Of these, 15 were synonymous and nine were nonsynonymous SNPs (Table 1). For the most part, SNPs in ABCB11 were relatively rare and population specific, with few exceptions. Of the nonsynonymous SNPs, the 1331T>C variant was very common in all ethnic populations tested while the 2029A>G variant was noted to be a common polymorphism in African–Americans. Functional analysis of bile salt export pump variants A panel of expression plasmids comprising wild-type BSEP, nine nonsynonymous BSEP variants, and two known PFIC2 BSEP missense mutants, 2944G>A (Gly982Arg) and 3457C>T (Arg1153Cys), was constructed for functional studies. A recombinant vaccinia-based method was used to transiently express both the bile acid uptake transporter sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) and bile acid efflux transporter BSEP in HeLa cells for transport studies. NTCP was used to deliver bile acids intracellularly as efflux transporters such as BSEP can only transport intracellular substrates. Therefore, wild type or variant BSEP was transfected concomitant with wild-type NTCP for cellular loading of the conjugated bile acid taurocholate. BSEP activity was assessed by comparing the accumulation of substrate in cells transfected with NTCP and variant BSEP with cells transfected with NTCP and wild-type BSEP. As expected, the PFIC2-associated missense mutations (2944G>A and 3457C>T) showed significantly impaired transport activity for the prototypical bile acid substrate taurocholate (Fig. 1b). In addition, several rare BSEP polymorphisms, including 616A>G (Ile206Val), 1674G>C (Gln558His), 1772A>G (Asn591Ser), and 3556G>A (Glu1186Lys) were also associated with significantly impaired taurocholate transport compared with wild-type BSEP, exhibited by retained increased intracellular taurocholate accumulation (P<0.05). Another rare BSEP variant, 890A>G (Glu297Gly), tended to have impaired taurocholate transport function, but did not reach statistical significance (P=0.051). Two common BSEP polymorphisms, 1331T>C (Val444Ala) and 2029A>G (Met677Val), were not associated with significant changes in taurocholate transport activity. Total and cell surf ace expression of bile salt export pump variants To determine whether the observed differences in transport activity of the BSEP polymorphisms were potentially as a result of altered protein expression or cell surface mistrafficking, western blot analysis of total cell lysates and cell surface biotinylated fractions were performed (Fig. 2a). V5 epitope-tagged wild-type and variant BSEP and wild-type NTCP constructs were generated and the same recombinant vaccinia-based method as used for transport experiments was used to express NTCP and wild-type or variant BSEP in HeLa cells. Taurocholate transport experiments revealed the V5-tagged variants to be functionally equivalent to the nontagged BSEP variants (data not shown). Densitometric analysis revealed the average total and cell surface expression of NTCP (approximately 5% variability, after normalization to calnexin expression; n=3 blots) was equivalent amongst cells transfected with wild type or variant BSEP. In contrast, variant to wild-type BSEP expression varied widely amongst both total (approximately 80% variability) and cell surface (approximately 90% variability) samples. Significantly reduced total and cell surface protein expression was noted for both of the PFIC-associated mutants 2944G>A and 3457C>T (Fig. 2b) compared with wild-type BSEP, suggesting protein instability and/or cell surface mistrafficking as mechanisms for loss of action. The BSEP variant 3556G>A also showed reduced cell surface expression relative to its total protein expression, suggesting mistrafficking defects may contribute to impaired transport function. Interestingly, the other BSEP variants associated with impaired protein function, 616G>A, 1674G>C, and 1772G>A, all showed comparable total and cell surface protein expression relative to wild-type BSEP suggesting mechanisms other than altered protein expression or mistrafficking contribute to their impaired function. Cell surface-expressed NTCP was enriched in a larger apparent molecular mass (approximately 50λkDa) major band compared with that observed in total cell lysates (approximately 37λkDa) due to glycosylation of NTCP on the cell surface, which we have previously shown. Calnexin, an intracellular resident endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein, was expressed in wild-type and variant total lysate samples, but as expected, was not enriched within the cell surface biotinylated samples. Plasma membrane localization of bile salt export pump variants in HepG2 cells Cell surface biotinylation experiments and western analysis of total cell lysates in transfected HeLa cells suggested that the reduced function associated with the BSEP PFIC2 mutants and the 3556G>A variant may be because of altered trafficking of the protein to the cell surface and increased protein degradation or instability, respectively. To further assess our findings, we performed immunofluorescence confocal microscopy in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. Moreover, unlike HeLa cells, as HepG2 is a liver-derived human cell line, membrane expression seen in this cell line may better recapitulate in-vivo physiology. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with V5-tagged wild-type or variant BSEP plasmid DNA. Using a secondary fluorescent-labeled antibody, we demonstrate that wild-type BSEP was targeted to the plasma membrane of HepG2 cells when viewed laterally (x–y scans) across the cells by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3). In contrast, expression of the PFIC2 mutants, 2944G>A, and 3457C>T, in HepG2 cells show marked retention of protein intracellularly and essentially the absence of plasma membrane expression, consistent with western blot analysis described earlier. The 3556G>A variant also showed both increased retention of intracellular protein and markedly reduced plasma membrane localization. Furthermore, other BSEP variants associated with impaired taurocholate transport, 616A>G, 1674G>C, and 1772A>G, all seem to localize appropriately to the plasma membrane. The 890A>G variant, which trended towards impaired function, also seemed to be targeted to the plasma membrane. Real-time quantification of bile salt export pump mRNA in human liver samples Real-time PCR quantification was performed on cDNA samples from a bank of 21 human livers (13 males, eight females). When normalized to 18S rRNA, the relative mean mRNA expression of BSEP tended to be lower than NTCP (24.9 vs. 64.6 copies/18S rRNA, P=0.07) (Fig. 4a). Interindividual variability was greater for NTCP (180-fold) versus BSEP (19-fold). Sex analysis revealed no significant sex differences in mRNA levels (28.1 male vs. 21.7 female copies/18S rRNA, P=0.42) (data not shown). DNA was extracted from the same human liver samples and genotyped for the commonly occurring BSEP polymorphism, 1331T>C. Out of a total of 42 alleles, the 1331T variant had a 48% allele frequency while the 1331C variant had a 52% allele frequency, consistent with previously published report and our own analysis in a larger cohort. Interestingly, there was a significant association of genotype to mRNA expression. Individuals homozygous for the 1331TT genotype had the highest mRNA levels (39.1 copies/18S rRNA), those heterozygous for the 1331TC genotype had intermediate mRNA levels (23.7 copies/18S rRNA), and those homozygous for the variant 1331CC genotype had the lowest mRNA levels (16.5 copies/18S rRNA) (Fig. 4b; P<0.05). Bile salt export pump protein expression in human liver samples Human liver samples were analyzed by western blot analysis for BSEP protein expression to assess interindividual variability. Of the 21 human liver samples for which BSEP mRNA expression and genotyping analysis were performed, 15 had available tissue for western blot analysis. There was wide intersubject variation in BSEP expression amongst liver samples (Fig. 5) with approximately 31-fold variation in protein expression determined by densitometric analysis after normalization for GAPDH expression. Although there was wide overall intersubject variability in both BSEP mRNA and protein expression, there was no significant correlation between BSEP mRNA levels and protein expression (Fig. 4d, R2=0.03, P=0.52). Furthermore, while BSEP 1331T>C genotype was significantly associated with mRNA levels, genotype was not significantly associated with BSEP protein expression (Fig. 4c, P=0.71).",1946
28839429,"Core tip: PFIC-2, a severe form of BSEP deficiency, is caused by mutations of the bile salt export pump (BSEP), an ATP binding cassette transporter exclusively expressed in hepatocytes. In this study we determine the functional impact of two distinct BSEP mutations on transporter localization and function in two unrelated PFIC-2 patients showing a drastically different response to partial external biliary diversion (PEBD). Our data demonstrate that residual bile salt transport by BSEP is likely required for a beneficial outcome of PEBD. INTRODUCTION Chronic cholestasis is a major cause of severe liver disease in young children. Apart from biliary atresia, four types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) are currently diagnosed. While PFIC-4 is caused by leaky bile canalicular tight junctions due to mutations in the TJP2 gene, PFIC-1 to -3 are caused by inherited defects in transporter proteins residing in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Mutations in the ATP8B1 gene encoding a phosphatidylserine flippase (FIC1) cause PFIC-1. PFIC-2 is linked to mutations in ABCB11 encoding the bile salt export pump (BSEP). BSEP is an ATP binding cassette transporter and transports conjugated bile salts (BS), with highest transport capacity for tauro-/glycochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDC/GCDC) and taurocholic acid (TC). Defects in canalicular BSEP functionality cause severe liver disease by compromising BS excretion into bile, while intracellular and serum BS concentrations rise to toxic levels. Milder forms of BSEP disease have been denoted as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC). BRIC is characterised by self-limiting cholestatic episodes with pruritus. BRIC-associated mutations are in general less severe as compared to PFIC-related mutations, which more often affect transmembrane helices and which include nonsense and frame-shift mutations. PFIC-3 is caused by mutations of the multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3) encoded by the ABCB4 gene. MDR3 transports phosphatidylcholine-type lipids from the inner to the outer canalicular membrane leaflet, from where they are likely extracted by BS to form mixed micelles with cholesterol. The flip of phosphatidylserine from the outer to the inner leaflet by the ATP8B1 gene product compensates this membrane destabilization. In PFIC-1 and PFIC-2 γ-glutamyltransferase (GT) levels are normal, which are attributed to low concentrations of free toxic BS in bile of these patients, whereas PFIC-3 is characterized by elevated serum γGT. Many PFIC patients receive ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) as a first-line treatment. UDCA stimulates BSEP expression, inhibits BS synthesis and stimulates BS clearance via urine. When symptoms do not improve sufficiently, partial external biliary diversion (PEBD) may be considered as a surgical intervention to reduce the toxic bile salt pool in PFIC-1 and -2. The continuous removal of bile may alleviate the otherwise intractable pruritus associated with PFIC, improving quality of life as well as prolonging transplant-free survival. While many PFIC-1 and -2 patients improve upon PEBD, some fail to benefit from the procedure. The reasons for the different therapeutic responses are not well understood. We investigated the functional properties of two BSEP missense mutations causing PFIC-2 in two unrelated children that responded fundamentally different to UDCA and PEBD treatment. RESULTS Two unrelated PFIC-2 patients with different responses to UDCA treatment and PEBD A two-months-old girl presented with non-obstructive cholestasis und severe pruritus. γGT levels were normal, while serum BS were strongly elevated (150 μmol/L). A liver biopsy at the age of 1 year showed no signs of inflammation but some fibrotic thickening of the portal tracts together with intra- and intercellular cholestasis. Therefore PFIC was suspected and at the age of five PEBD was initiated to avert further cholestatic liver damage. Serum BS decreased and symptoms completely resolved. At the age of 17 years, a moderate deterioration of liver function was observed. Fibroscan was 14.1 kPa reflecting fibrosis or cholestasis. A liver biopsy (for immunostaining), a DNA sample and diverted bile were taken and analysed. Because a low-γGT PFIC was suspected, sequencing of ATP8B1 (FIC1) and ABCB11 (BSEP) was performed. While ATP8B1 only showed two heterozygous intronic variants, sequencing of ABCB11 revealed a heterozygous nonsense mutation (c.3703C>T; p.R1235X) and a heterozygous triplet deletion (c.2756_2758delCCA), causing loss of a single threonine at amino acid position 919 (p.T919del). Genetic analysis of the healthy parents indicated paternal inheritance of the nonsense mutation and maternal inheritance of the deletion. The patient continued to be symptom-free under PEBD without the need for liver transplantation in the continuous presence of UDCA treatment. An unrelated boy of 18 mo presented with non-obstructive cholestasis and severe pruritus and total serum BS were increased (371 μmol/L). PFIC was suspected, however, UDCA treatment did not alleviate pruritus. PEBD was performed at two years and seven months of age, which led to a drop of serum bile salts from 412 μmol/L (the day before PEBD) to 207 μmol/L (5 d post-OP), 70 μmol/L (7 mo after PEBD) and 93 μmol/L (1 year after PEBD). Symptoms only improved transiently. A biopsy taken during the PEBD showed no signs of fibrosis. Sequencing of ATP8B1 (FIC1) showed the common heterozygous variant p.R952Q and the common homozygous variant p.N168N was found in the ABCB4 gene. ABCB11 sequencing, however, uncovered the same heterozygous nonsense mutation (c.3703C>T; p.R1235X) as found in the first patient along with a heterozygous missense mutation (c.3094G>C) leading to an amino acid change from glycine to arginine at position 1032 (p.G1032R). Genetic testing of both healthy parents showed paternal inheritance of the nonsense and maternal inheritance of the missense mutation. At the age of four, this patient had to be transplanted due to his intractable pruritus despite PEBD. Histology of the explant confirmed absence of cirrhosis. Bile salt analysis of serum and bile confirm defects in bile salt transport Total BS concentration in bile of the female patient (p.T919del) was 1531 μmol/L (including 931 μmol/L of UDCA derivatives), which is only 2.5% of total biliary BS in non-cholestatic patients (Table 1 and Figure 1). As in controls and in patients with obstructive cholestasis, we found almost no unconjugated BS in her bile. Notably, the ratio between taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids in the patient’s bile was very similar to the ratio in controls (Figure 1A). Likewise, the fraction of CDCA derivatives was comparable to that in controls. The fraction of cholic acid (CA) derivatives was higher in the patient than in controls. This can be attributed to partial disruption of the enterohepatic circulation by PEBD. In healthy individuals, CA and its derivatives are dehydroxylated in the intestine by bacteria to deoxycholic acid (DCA), which is reabsorbed. Indeed, the combined relative amount of DCA and CA derivatives in controls is of the same magnitude as that of CA in the patient. Total serum BS concentration was 150 μmol/L (normal: < 8 μmol/L) including UDCA-derivatives, while relative amounts of single BS species were similar to values in controls. As in bile, DCA and derivatives were absent in the patient’s serum. Taken together, the findings suggest a severe reduction markedly reduced canalicular BSEP function in the presence of the p.T919del mutation despite UDCA treatment, which is known to stabilize BSEP and enhance its expression. Bile of the male patient (p.G1032R) showed a total BS amount of 3451 μmol/L (about 5% of controls; Table 1 and Figure 1). Surprisingly, 68% of these were unconjugated bile acids (Figure 1B). Furthermore, there were no conjugates of CDCA and only a minor proportion was unconjugated CDCA. CA and its conjugates amounted to more than 95% of bile acids in the patient’s bile. The absence of CDCA and its conjugates was not caused by defects in conjugation, because tauro- as well as glyco-CDCA was present in elevated amounts with a normal ratio of CDCA derivatives in the serum of the patient (Table 1). While the absolute amount of CA derivatives was 22% of controls, the total amount of CDCA and its derivatives was only 0.4% of controls. These data strongly suggest that the p.G1032R mutation also reduces canalicular BSEP function. The observed shift from CDCA to CA derivatives may be caused by an altered substrate specificity of BSEP, when the mutation p.G1032R is present. The predominance of unconjugated BS may be due to bacterial contamination of the biliary tract after PEBD and subsequent de-conjugation by bacterial enzymes, although the patient had no signs of bacterial cholangitis. BSEP-T919del and BSEP-G1032R are correctly localized in vivo and and in vitro Immunofluorescent staining showed normal canalicular expression of MDR3 and MRP2 (bilirubin transporter) in liver biopsies of both patients (Figure 2A). Since BSEP-R1235X lacks the C-terminal 87 amino acid residues containing essential motifs of the second nucleotide binding domain (Walker B, D-and H-loop), this premature stop results in a truncated, non-functional transporter. Using the K24 antiserum raised against the C-terminus of BSEP, only the full-length variants carrying the missense mutation or deletion alleles are detected. Both BSEP-T919del and BSEP-G1032R showed normal, canalicular localization. To further confirm this, both mutations were introduced into a mammalian BSEP expression plasmid and transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. Both BSEP-T919del and BSEP-G1032R showed a regular plasma membrane localization comparable to wild-type BSEP (Figure 2B). Bile salt transport by BSEP-T919del and BSEP-G1032R is impaired in vitro Plasma membrane vesicles containing wild-type BSEP, BSEP-T919del or BSEP-G1032R were prepared from transiently transfected HEK293 cells. In order to determine a transport rate per BSEP rather than per total protein, we purified recombinant human BSEP from the yeast Pichia pastoris as described in detail in Ellinger et al. Protein purity, as isolated by a two-step purification procedure, was more than 90% (Figure 3A, left panel). Using purified BSEP as quantitative standard, we quantified BSEP amounts in vesicle preparations by immunoblotting (Figure 3A, right panel for an example). Vesicular transport assays (Figure 3B) using equal amounts of each BSEP variant showed a strong reduction of TC and TCDC transport by BSEP-T919del and an even more pronounced reduction in transport for BSEP-G1032R. Notably, the amount of transported TC and TCDC increased from 5 min to 30 min for BSEP-T919del. In contrast, no increase of TC or TCDC accumulation over time was observed for BSEP-G1032R within experimental error.",1647
30784208,"INTRODUCTION Severe drug‐induced liver injury (DILI) is a challenging issue for health care providers, regulators, and pharmaceutical companies. In severe cases patients may require a liver transplant or experience death. Hepatotoxic agents can be broadly classified into two categories: intrinsic hepatotoxicants (those that cause liver injury predictably in humans and animals when given in sufficiently high doses) and idiosyncratic hepatotoxicants (those that cause liver injury in “susceptible” individual humans, are more varied in their clinical presentation, and generally do not cause hepatotoxicity in animals).1 Hepatotoxic agents in the former category are detected in standardized nonclinical safety assessment studies and generally removed from further drug development. However, due to the low incidence of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, potential pharmaceutical agents in the latter category are more difficult to detect in standardized nonclinical/clinical studies and may not become evident until well after marketing approval is granted. There is a third category in practice where drug candidates cause a relatively high incidence of transaminase elevations in early clinical trials that were not detected in nonclinical safety assessment studies. Trying to mitigate these risks are the subject of many initiatives within the pharmaceutical industry2, 3, 4 that can vary in their approach.5, 6, 7, 8 Integrating these approaches into decisions regarding medicinal design and compound selection is important since standard animal models only predict about 55%9, 10 of human transaminase elevations.PF‐04895162 (ICA‐105665, discovered by Icagen, Inc., Durham, NC), is a novel small molecule that showed signs of efficacy for the treatment of epilepsy11 by opening neuronal Kv7.2/7.3 and Kv7.3/7.5 potassium channels.12 In nonclinical studies, only a single 7‐day exploratory toxicity study in rats showed a dose‐dependent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation that was not accompanied by any histological correlate. This finding was not confirmed in a repeat 7 day study at a higher dose in rats or in longer term safety assessment studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys of 6 and 9 months in duration, respectively. Therefore, this drug candidate advanced into clinical studies in healthy subjects and patients with epilepsy. No evidence of liver injury in healthy subjects was observed in single dose studies up to 600 mg11 or multiple doses up to 200 mg twice daily (BID) for 7 days.13 Mild/moderate transaminase elevations were noted in one of 12 subjects each at 250 mg BID and 300 mg BID PF‐04895162 for 7‐days (Pfizer data on file). However, in a 14‐day multiple dose study in healthy subjects, transaminase elevations as high as 5x the ULN were noted in six of eight subjects who received 300 mg BID PF‐04895162. This high incidence rate in a small subset of subjects led to the discontinuation of this drug candidate from further clinical development. To investigate mechanistic factors possibly contributing to the observed liver injury, a broad suite of assays were conducted where inhibition of both mitochondrial function and BSEP transporter activity were highlighted as possible mechanisms. To establish a clinical correlation to these postulated mechanistic liabilities, that are known independent or combined drivers of liver injury, a few treated subjects from the 14‐day clinical study consented to additional biomarker examination using residual pharmacokinetic samples. Elevations in miRNA122 levels coincided with ALT elevations, confirming liver origin of ALT. Total and individual tauro‐ and glyco‐conjugated bile acids, which are purportedly preferential substrates for BSEP transport, were elevated in plasma from affected, but not unaffected subjects, suggesting some specific effect of PF‐04895162 on hepatobiliary elimination of bile acids concurrently or in advance of liver injury. Although more clinical drug examples are needed to confirm these observations as evidence of interruption of hepatobiliary transport of bile acids, resulting in liver transaminase elevation, the present investigation provided a blueprint for showing correlations between in vitro mechanistic assays with clinical findings and the need to examine total and individual bile acids species as a means to provide relevant supporting biomarker data of a mechanistically linked clinical outcome. RESULTS Nonclinical safety assessment summary A summary of liver effects along with a detailed synopsis of each nonclinical study that was used to support the Investigational New Drug Application filing along with longer term studies can be found in the supplemental information associated with this article. In brief, this compound advanced into clinical studies without any histopathological evidence of liver injury or reproducible transaminase elevations in rats and monkeys. The addition of total bile acid analysis in nonclinical safety assessment studies, although germane to this investigation retrospectively, is not routine.26 Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of parent and metabolites were examined in albino and pigmented male rats after administration of a single oral dose (target 15 mg/kg) of 14C‐labeled parent. Elimination of radioactivity occurred mostly within the first 24 hours after dosing with approximately 71 and 22% of the administered dose excreted in feces and urine, respectively. An equivalent human study was not performed. Healthy subject clinical study summary Ten subjects were enrolled and received treatment in the clinical study. All subjects were male, aged 19 to 44 years, eight subjects were Black and two subjects were White. One subject was withdrawn due to an adverse event following 300 mg BID PF‐04895162. All other subjects completed the study. Safety: All subjects reported at least 1 adverse event during the study (Table 1). None of the adverse events were severe or serious. One subject (Subject 7) discontinued after 3 days of 300 mg BID PF‐04895162 due to clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (elevated lipase and amylase) which were investigated in response to the subject reporting mild abdominal pain. Laboratory tests on Day 3 of Period 3 showed a lipase value of 434 (IU/L) (ULN = 60 IU/L) and an amylase value of 179 (IU/L) (ULN = 136 IU/L). These values were considered treatment‐related by the Investigator and the subject was withdrawn from study. The only adverse events reported by more than one subject in any treatment group were increased transaminases (six subjects), increased amylase, increased flatulence, and decreased appetite (two subjects each), all of which occurred following 300 mg BID PF‐04895162. On Day 14, six of the remaining seven subjects who finished Period 3 and received 300 mg BID PF‐04895162 had elevations in ALT of which three were classed as Grade 1 (>1.25 to 2.5x ULN), two were classed as Grade 2 (>2.5 to 5x ULN), and one was classed as Grade 3 (>5 to 10x ULN)(Table 2, Figure 2). The subject with the Grade 3 ALT elevation (5.6x ULN; Subject 8) also had a Grade 2 increase in AST (2.7x ULN), a mild elevation of GGT (1.4x ULN starting on Day 14), elevations in amylase (starting on Day 16) with no elevation of ALK PHOS. Two subjects (Subjects 1 and 2) had a Grade 1 (>1 to 1.5x ULN) increase in total bilirubin. The one subject (Subject 7) that withdrew from the study before the first scheduled assessment also had Grade 1 (>1.25 to 2.5x ULN) elevations in ALT. These elevations in transaminases/bilirubin were asymptomatic and resolved on cessation of dosing without further intervention. There were no other clinically relevant findings related to laboratory safety tests (including hepatitis panel and HIV), or other safety assessments including C‐SSRS. Pharmacokinetics of PF‐04895162 Peak concentrations of PF04895162 were achieved on Days 7 and 14 at a median of 2 hours postdose, which was earlier than the median observed following a single dose (5 hours under fasting conditions) (Table 3). PF‐04895162 exposure increased from single to multiple dosing with accumulation ratios for Cmax and AUCtau on Day 14 of 1.7 and 1.6, respectively. The highest mean Cmax (observed on Day 7) was 9432 ng/mL which is equivalent to 26.5 μmol/L (total concentration). The predicted accumulation ratio to estimate linearity (i.e., ratio of AUCtau on Day 14 to AUCinf on Day 1) was less than 1 (0.826) suggesting that PF‐04895162 may have nonlinear (time‐dependent) pharmacokinetics. Mean terminal half‐life was similar after single and multiple dosing (approximately 8 hours). A high‐fat meal appeared to affect the rate but not the extent of PF‐04895162 absorption as Cmax doubled in the presence of food, whereas the 90% confidence intervals for the geometric mean ratio for AUCinf were within the accepted bounds for bioequivalence (i.e., 80 to 125%) (Table 4). Evaluation of potential hepatotoxicity mechanisms Since hepatotoxicity was not identified as a hazard in nonclinical studies, we performed a series of in vitro mechanistic studies. PF‐04895162 did not display potent cytotoxic properties in THLE and HepG2 cell lines (IC50 ~192 and 130 μmol/L after 72 hours, respectively) or in human hepatocytes (AC50 for cell loss at 48 hours was >125 μmol/L based on results in three assessments in two different human hepatocyte lots (LBN and HU4165). Justification and utilization of human Cmax exposure based on total values versus free were reported by us previously.3 Total Cmax exposures in human subjects (26.5 μmol/L from Table 3) were at least fivefold below the cytotoxic thresholds identified in liver cell lines and human hepatocytes. BSEP inhibition in Hi5 vesicles was noted with an IC50 = 106 μmol/L (N = 4, geometric mean), whereas also displaying multiple mitochondrial effects (IC50 ~10 μmol/L for inhibition of glutamate/malate respiration, ~70 μmol/L for impaired palmitate fatty acid oxidation, and >100 μmol/L for uncoupling activity, N = 2). Mitochondrial respiratory reserve was also compromised in human hepatocytes treated with PF‐04895162 at concentrations >11 μmol/L for 25 minutes (data not shown). Combined inhibition of mitochondria and human BSEP transport prompted us to examine clinical samples from this clinical trial more closely based on previous findings by us regarding the association of clinical liver injury with drugs that are dual BSEP and mitochondrial inhibitors.2 Deeper examination of possible interactions with other hepatic bile acid transporters showed weak inhibition of MRP4 (IC50 = 121 μmol/L) that was similar to BSEP inhibition, no inhibitory effect on MRP3, partial inhibition of NTCP (30% at 250 μmol/L), and stimulation of MDR3 activity in human hepatocytes (200 μmol/L, N = 3). Examination of residual plasma pharmacokinetic samples for biomarkers of liver injury Three of eight treated healthy subjects consented for additional analyses of residual plasma PK samples for biomarkers of liver injury (e.g., miRNA122, total, and fractionated bile acids). Subject 8 had the highest ALT elevation (maximum value during the course of study of 240 IU/L or 5.85x ULN) by Day 7, Subject 10 had a mid‐level ALT response (maximum value during the course of study of 115 IU/L or 2.8x ULN) by Day 14, whereas Subject 6 did not demonstrate any ALT elevations by Day 14, the last day of dosing (Figure 2). Serum ALT levels from the three subjects that consented to additional investigations are redisplayed from Figure 2 for illustrative comparisons (Figure 3, upper panel). Using PK samples consented for exploratory biomarker examination, we showed that plasma miRNA122 was elevated (>ULN) by Day 5 in Subject 8 and by Day 12 in Subject 10 (Figure 3, middle panel), confirming liver specificity of the elevated ALT response (Figure 3, upper panel). Both ALT and mRNA122 remained elevated 2 days after discontinuation of drug on Day 14 before returning to normal values. Total bile acids were likewise visibly higher for Subject 8 compared to other treated subjects (Figure 3, lower panel) and returned to values similar to other treated subjects within 2 days after discontinuation of drug (Day 14, morning dose administered). Although total bile acid levels were stratified between treated subjects, these levels were within normal range. Differential responses between treated subjects were also observed in the plasma profile of bile acids. After the first daily dose, total bile acids in systemic circulation on Day 7 (AUC 0‐12 hours) and Day 14 (AUC 0‐12 hours) were elevated in Subject 8 compared to Subjects 10 and 6 (Figure 4A). By Day 14, Subject 8 also displayed elevated levels of the more hydrophobic unconjugated bile acid species (chenodeoxycholic acid‐CDCA and deoxycholic acid‐DCA compared to cholic acid‐CA) in systemic circulation relative to Day 7 and other treated subjects (Figure 4B). On study days where we could examine time‐course effects, it was noticed that Subject 8 did not appear to clear total bile acids from systemic circulation after the midday and last meal on Day 7 (Figure 4C) as effectively as the other two subjects with a possible effect on Subject 10 after the midday meal. At this time there was also a noteworthy change in conjugated bile acids species across treated subjects. Subject 8 showed elevated bile acid molar ratios of TCDCA/CDCA relative to TCA/CA (Figure 4D) and GCDCA/CDCA relative to GCA/CA on Day 7 (Figure 4E) when ALT was 1.5x the ULN. Subject 10 showed a similar effect on bile acid molar ratios, in the absence of ALT elevations on Day 7, whereas Subject 6 was unaffected. On Day 7 the hydrophobicity index of serum bile acids were similar across subjects (0.47, 0.45, and 0.40 (AUC 0‐12 h) for Subject 6, 10, and 8, respectively). Therefore, by Day 7 there was a specific effect on the molar ratios of conjugated to unconjugated bile acid species in the absence of changes in the serum bile acid hydrophobicity index that occurred in Subject 10 before transaminase elevations were evident on Day 14. This is noteworthy since GCDCA and TCDCA are highly preferred glycine‐ and taurine‐conjugated bile acids substrates for BSEP transport compared to TCA and GCA based on intrinsic clearance values in isolated vesicles,27 suggestive of a specific effect on BSEP efflux function. Differences in drug exposure could not explain individual susceptibility as the subject with the highest ALT values (Subject 8) had PF‐04895162 exposures that were within the range of the rest of the treated group (Cmax and AUCtau on Day 7 for Subject 8 were 10 800 ng/mL and 93 000 ng.h/mL, respectively, compared to ranges of 7070 to 13 200 ng/mL for Cmax and 69 600 to 121 000 ng.h/mL for AUCtau in the treated cohort).",2199
