General and Demographic Characteristics of the Participants According to Gender and Obesity\n\nThe men were older than the women, while the obese women were older than the nonobese women (p < 0.001). Obese women were shorter than nonobese women, but there was no height difference linked to obesity in men (p < 0.001). The average BMIs of the nonobese and obese groups were approximately 22.5 and 27.1 kg/m2, respectively, in both gender groups (Table 1). The waist circumferences were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, but men in the obese and nonobese groups had greater waist circumferences than women in the corresponding weight groups. Interestingly, the skeletal muscle and fat mass were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group for both genders (p < 0.05; Table 1). On the other hand, the adjusted ORs were much higher for waist circumferences (OR = 18.3 and 95% CI: 16.5–20.3) and fat mass (OR = 20.71 and 95% CI = 17.83–24.16) for obesity risk than the skeletal muscle mass. The initial menstrual age was younger in the obese group than in the nonobese group, while there was no significant difference in menopausal age in the obese and nonobese groups (Table 1).\n\nThe incidence of metabolic syndrome was much higher in the obese groups in both genders, and the risk of metabolic syndrome increased 5.86-fold in the obese group (p < 0.001; Table 1). The components of metabolic syndrome were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders. Serum total cholesterol and LDL concentrations were much higher in women than men, but the serum triglyceride concentrations were higher in men than women (Table 1). The serum HDL concentrations were higher in women than men. In the combined lipid profiles, women had as many lipid disturbances as men. Furthermore, obese women exhibited higher serum hs-CRP concentrations than nonobese women, but this was not observed in men (Table 1). Blood pressure, including systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), was higher in the obese group than the nonobese group, and men showed higher blood pressure than women. Women had much higher eGFR than men, and eGFR was lower in the obese group than in the nonobese group. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations were higher in the obese groups than the nonobese groups in both genders. Obesity increased the odds ratio for higher AST and ALT concentrations by 2.0 and 2.7-fold, respectively (Table 1). \n\n3.2. Lifestyle Characteristics of the Participants According to Genders and Obesity\n\nThe daily energy intake based on the estimated energy intake was higher in the obese groups than the nonobese group in both genders, and it increased the obesity risk by 1.24-fold. The protein intake also elevated the obesity risk (p < 0.05; Table 2) based on the daily energy intake. In women, the carbohydrate intake was higher in the obesity group than the nonobese group, and the association of the carbohydrate intake with the obesity risk was marginally significant (p = 0.0508). Fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and cholesterol intake, were not associated with the obesity risk (Table 2). Their intake was slightly higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in men, but their intakes showed an opposite tendency in women. DII was similar in the obese and nonobese groups, but DII was higher in men than women (Table 2). Interestingly, the fried-food intake was higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, but the intake of sugar-containing foods was higher in the nonobese groups than the obese group in women, but not men (Table 2). Obese men had a higher intake of a Korean balanced diet and Western-style diet than the nonobese men, while there was no difference in the plant-based diet and rice-based diet intake in obese and nonobese men (Table 2). Obese women had a lower plant-based diet and a higher Korean balanced diet than nonobese women. There was no significant association of dietary patterns with obesity risk (Table 2).\n\nAlcohol intake was much higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, particularly in men (Table 2). Alcohol intake was positively associated with the obesity risk. Fewer current smokers belonged to the obese group than the nonobese group in men but not women (Table 2). Regular exercise lowered the incidence of obesity in women but not men. Regular exercise was inversely associated with the risk of obesity (Table 2). \n\n3.3. Genetic Variants Related to the Obesity Risk and the Best Model with SNP-SNP Interaction\n\nTen genes with SNPs that affect the obesity risk were chosen to examine genetic variant−genetic variant interactions in the GMDR in the urban hospital-based cohort (Table 3). The selected genetic variants involved in the obesity risk were SEC16 Homolog B (SEC16B, endoplasmic reticulum export factor) rs543874, DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C27 (DNAJC27)_rs713586, CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1)_rs9356744, transcription factor AP-2 Beta (TFAP2B)_rs",

The selected genetic variants involved in the obesity risk were SEC16 Homolog B (SEC16B, endoplasmic reticulum export factor) rs543874, DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C27 (DNAJC27)_rs713586, CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1)_rs9356744, transcription factor AP-2 Beta (TFAP2B)_rs2206277, BDNF_rs6265, myosin light chain-2 (MYL2)_rs3782889, olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4)_rs9568856, FTO_rs1421085, MC4R_rs6567160, and GIPR_rs1444988703 (Table 3). These genes were strongly connected, and FTO and MC4R acted as hub genes that affect the risk of obesity. All of the genes were involved in either energy intake or energy expenditure by modulating transcription factors. These SNPs satisfied the MAF (>0.01) and HWE (p > 0.05) criteria (Table 2). Some SNPs had an inverse association with obesity risk, while the other SNPs were positively associated with the obesity risk. The p values of most selected SNPs were higher than 5×10−7, but rs3782889_MYL2 and rs9356744_CDKAL1 did not meet the statistical criteria (Table 3). These SNPs had similar associations with the obesity risk, and the statistical significance was higher in the Ansan/Ansung cohort (Table 3), but they were not ultimately included in the best model.\n\nAmong the genetic variants selected, the models including 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 SNPs met the criteria of TREB and CVC for the best model to explain the SNP−SNP interactions that contribute to obesity risk. The five models exhibited significant interactions among the genetic variants that influenced the obesity risk (Table 4). The 5-SNP model included SEC16B_rs543874, DNAJC27_rs713586, BDNF_rs6265, MC4R_rs6567160, and GIPR_rs1444988703. The genetic variants in model 5 plus CDKAL1_rs9356744 and OLFM4_rs9568856 (model 7) also exhibited significant interactions (Table 4). The models that added the remainder of the SNPs to model 7 also had significant interactions for obesity risk. After adjusting for covariates, the models included five, seven, eight, nine, and ten genetic variants that met the TRBA, TEBA, and CVC criteria, including gender, age, resident area, regular exercise, and smoking status. However, since all of these models have similar statistical significance; therefore model 5, which included the smallest number of variables, was selected.\n\nModel 5 resulted in participants having PRS scores ranging from 0–9 risk alleles. The results show that BMI showed an increasing trend with PRS, and the participants with PRS scores of 8 and 9 had a sharp increment in BMI (Figure 2A). Although there was a positive association between PRS and BMI, some severely obese and underweight participants were distributed among the top deciles of PRS (8 and 9) to the bottom decile (0). However, obese (25–30 kg/m2) and severely obese (>30 kg/m2) persons had much higher representations in the middle deciles (2–7) than normal (18.5–23 kg/m2 for men and 18.5–22 kg/m2 for women), overweight (23–25 kg/m2 for men and 22–25 kg/m2 for women), and underweight (Figure 2B). In the other stratification, participants were assigned to low PRS (0–3), medium PRS (4–5), and high PRS (≥6) (Figure 2C). The PRS stratification showed a similar pattern of the top, middle, and bottom deciles, but the percentage of overweight participants in the three PRS groups was not significantly different.\n\nThe high PRS of the 5-SNP model was positively associated with the obesity risk: by 1.626 (1.474–1.801) and 1.629 (1.475–1.798) times after adjusting for covariates 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 2D). The high PRS with seven SNPs also showed a positive association with the obesity risk, but the ORs of the 7-SNP model were slightly smaller than those in the 5-SNP model (Figure 2D).\n\nThe PRS was significantly associated with the BMI: 1.43-fold and 1.55-fold in men and women, respectively, after adjusting for the covariates (Table 5). On the other hand, PRS was not related to waist circumference and SMI after adjusting for the covariates, including BMI. Interestingly, the fat mass was positively associated with fat by 1.46-fold only in men but not women after adjusting for covariates, including the BMI (Table 5). In addition, PRS was not related to menarche and menopausal age in women after adjusting for the covariates. \n\n3.4. Interaction of PRS and Nutrient Intake in Obesity Risk\n\nInterestingly, initial menstruation age interacted with PRS for the obesity risk. In participants with an early menarche age, the BMI was higher than those with late menarche age. The impact of PRS was much higher in the participants with early menstruation than those with",

In a low plant-based diet intake, the genetic impact was lower for BMI, whereas the participants with a high PRS had a higher BMI than those with a low PRS with a high plant-based dietary intake (Figure 3B). Adults with a high PRS were protected against the obesity risk in a high plant-based diet (Table 6). The nutrient intake and other dietary patterns did not show any interactions with the PRS to affect the obesity risk.\n\nFried-food intake exhibited an interaction with the PRS (Table 6). The high fried-food intake participants had a higher BMI, but the PRS impact was offset in the participants with a high fried-food intake (Figure 3C). Thus, fried-food intake should be avoided to protect against obesity, even though a high PRS did not significantly exacerbate the obesogenic effects of fried-food intake (p = 0.035).",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nCharacteristics of study population.\n\nBaseline characteristics of participants according to the FTO rs1558902 genotype are presented in Table 1. The minor allele frequency (MAF; A allele) was 0.402 in the total population. The genotype frequencies were significantly different among the sexes and ethnicities. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, all variables such as weight, BMI, WC, body composition, and fat distribution had no association with genotype at baseline. Baseline characteristics were similar among participants in the four diet groups (Supplementary Table 1). Likewise, no associations between the FTO genotypes and these measures were observed in the white participants (data not shown).\n\nEffects of FTO rs1558902 genotype on weight and waist: overall and two-factorial analysis.\n\nAfter adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline BMI, and diet groups, no main effects of the FTO rs1558902 genotype on changes in weight or WC were found in any participants at 6 months and 2 years (data not shown). We next examined the genetic effects on changes in weight and WC following a two-factorial design: low versus high fat and low versus high protein. We found that the risk allele (A) was significantly associated with a 1.51-kg greater weight loss in the high-protein group (P = 0.010), but not in the low-protein group, by the end of intervention (2 years). The changes in weight and WC were less significant at 6 months (Table 2). In subgroups treated by different proportions of dietary fat, we did not find significant genetic effects on changes in weight and WC (all P > 0.05; Supplementary Table 2).Similarly, in the white participants, we found the risk allele was associated with a 1.38-kg greater weight loss in the high-protein group at 2 years (P = 0.028), but not in other subgroups (data not shown).\n\nThe FTO rs1558902 genotype and changes in body composition by diet intervention.\n\nConsistent with the observations of change in body weight, we found that the rs15589002 risk allele (A) was associated with greater loss of total fat, FFM, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat at 2 years in the high-protein group, but not in the low-protein group (Table 2). Tests for genotype-diet protein interaction were significant on changes in FFM and FM% (for interactions, P = 0.034 and 0.049, respectively) adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, carbohydrate, baseline BMI, and the baseline value of body composition (Fig. 1). At 6 months, we only observed gene by protein diet interaction on changes in FFM (P = 0.008 for interaction; Fig. 1). The risk allele carriers in the high-protein group had greater loss of FFM than noncarriers, but those in the low-protein group had less loss of FFM compared with noncarriers (Table 2).\n\nWe did not find significant genetic effect and interactions between the FTO variant and dietary fat intake on changes in body composition in total participants (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The results in the white participants were similar (data not shown).\n\nThe FTO rs1558902 genotype and changes in fat distribution by diet intervention.\n\nWe further analyzed body fat distribution measured by CT. At 2 years, we found significant interactions between the FTO rs1558902 genotype and protein diet intervention on changes in TAT, VAT, and SAT (for interactions, P = 0.001, 0.012, and 0.002, respectively; Fig. 2). The risk allele (A) was associated with greater loss of TAT and VAT in the high-protein group but with less loss of TAT and SAT in the low-protein group (Table 2). At 6 months, gene-protein interactions were observed on changes in TAT and SAT (for interactions, P = 0.026 and 0.050, respectively; Fig. 2), and the risk allele carriers in the high-protein group had greater loss of TAT and VAT than noncarriers, but those in the low-protein group had less loss of SAT than noncarriers (Table 2).\n\nWe did not find significant genetic effects and interactions on changes in fat distribution in subgroups treated by different dietary fat components (all P > 0.05; Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2).Similar results were found in the white participants (data not shown).\n\nThe trajectory of changes in body composition and fat distribution by FTO rs1558902 in response to protein diet.\n\nIn a secondary analysis, we used linear mixed models to assess the genotype by time effect over the 2-year trial in those treated by the four dietary compositions. We observed significant genotype-time interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat in response to the high-protein diet. When assigned to the high-protein diet, participants who carried the AA genotype had greater loss in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat than those without this genotype. No genotype-time interaction on changes in body composition was found in the low-protein group (Fig. 3).\n\nWe also observed significant genotype-time interactions on changes in fat distribution in response to the low- and high-protein diets. Participants with the AA genotype had greater decrease in fat distribution in response to the high-protein diet compared with those without this genotype. In contrast, participants with the AA genotype were associated with less loss in TAT and SAT in response to the low-protein diet (Fig. 4).\n\nWe found genotype-time interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat",

    "content": "Results\n\nGenome-wide genetic correlation\n\nWe found strong positive genetic correlations with BF% for both HF (Rg = 0.47, P = 1.27 × 10− 22) and CAD (Rg = 0.22, P = 3.26 × 10− 07) in large study populations that were predominantly of European ancestry (more than 75%) (Table 1, Table S1). Additionally, we found nominally significant genetic correlation with BF% for ICH (Rg = 0.29; P = 0.021) and HDL (Rg = − 0.326; P = 0.048). However, we did not find evidence of genetic correlation between BF% and IS, MI, AF, TC, TG, and LDL (all P > 0.05) (Table 1). Estimates of SNP-based heritability on the observed scale using GWAS summary statistics are shown in Table S2. \n\nSince high positive genetic correlations between BF% and CVDs was only observed with HF and CAD, we further used 13 functional annotations to evaluate genetic correlations between BF% and HF or CAD in the partitioned genetic correlation analysis by specific functional category. The highest magnitude of significant genetic correlation was in the repressed region (Rg = 0.88; P = 1.51 × 10− 05) for BF% and HF, which could restore the phenotypic effects of a mutant gene. The correlation estimate for BF% and CAD was highest in the conserved region (Rg = 0.20; P = 5.00 × 10− 04), where this region remained almost unchanged during evolution (Fig. 2; Table S3). The shared genetic etiology for BF% and CVDs encourages the exploration of a common pathophysiology, especially in specific functional categories. Subsequently, we conducted a partitioned genetic correlation analysis by SNP groups with different P values and found that the first two groups remained significant (P < 1.00 × 10− 05), suggesting that our findings were robust (Figure S1-S2). \n\nMTAG for single traits\n\nManhattan plots from the GWAS and MTAG analyses for each trait are shown in Fig. 3. From GWAS to MTAG, the total number of lead SNPs increased from 11 to 16 for BF% and from 42 to 51 for CAD, while no changes were found for HF. We confirmed most of the previously identified loci and found novel associations between BF% and HF and CAD. Out of the 16 independent loci reported for BF% using MTAG, 6 were novel associations and 2 of these fell within protein-coding gene bodies (PLA2G6, RPTOR) (Table S4). Among the 51 loci associated with CAD, 13 were novel loci, 10 of which were mapped to protein-coding genes (i.e., HNRNPUL1, NAA25, FES, TNS1, CYP46A1, ABCG8, IGF2BP1, BCAS3, SMG6, APOE) (Table S4). The proteins encoded by these gene and gene-related pathways are shown in Table S4. Out of the 10 independent loci identified for HF, 8 were novel, 3 of which were mapped to protein-coding genes (i.e., FTO, NPC1, IGF2BP1) (Table S4). \n\nCross-trait meta-analysis\n\nGiven the strong genetic correlation between BF% and HF or CAD, we further used MTAG to perform genome-wide meta-analysis to improve our power to identify shared significant genetic loci (meta-analysis P < 5 × 10− 08 and single trait P < 0.05). The genomic control parameter (λ) was 1.16 in the cross-trait meta-analysis for BF% and HF, while λ = 1.20 for BF% and CAD (Figure S3-S4). Illustrative calculations in the two-trait setting were 0.0012 for BF% and CAD and 0.0035 for BF% and HF. The Manhattan plot of these results indicated that shared genetic loci drove the overall significance of the meta-analysis (Fig. 4). \n\nWe identified 5 genome-wide significant independent loci for BF% and HF (Table 2). Out of the 5 independent loci, 3 were mapped to protein-coding genes (i.e., FTO, NPC1, LPA). The strongest signal was observed on chromosome 16 at the FTO region (index SNP rs9937053, Pmeta = 1.09 × 10− 18), the first GWAS-identified susceptibility gene for obesity. This locus was not only significant after meta-analysis, but also reached genome-wide significance in both single-trait GWAS of BF% (P = 9.86 × 10− 26) and HF (P = 2.99 × 10− 08). The second strongest signal was in close proximity to an intergenic region closest to the GNPDA2 gene on chromosome 4 (index SNP rs10938397, Pmeta = 4.36 × 10− 10), a critical gene involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Previous studies found that the expression level of GNPDA2 alters the transcriptome profile of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, we found that genetic loci represented by rs10455872 (Pmeta = 3.88 × 10− 09) on LPA are associated with both BF% and HF after meta-analysis.",

In addition, we found that genetic loci represented by rs10455872 (Pmeta = 3.88 × 10− 09) on LPA are associated with both BF% and HF after meta-analysis. Variation within LPA has shown strong association with Lp(a)-cholesterol levels, which is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular-related events. \n\nThe cross-trait meta-analysis between BF% and CAD identified 16 genome-wide significant loci (Table 3), 10 of which were in protein-coding gene bodies (i.e., LPA, HORMAD1, MIA3, WDR12, DGKH, CYP46A1, FES, FTO, IGF2BP1, BCAS3). The most significant locus is characterized by the LPA gene (index SNP rs10455872, Pmeta = 3.14 × 10− 28). The second locus (index SNP rs8050136, Pmeta = 4.02 × 10− 19) was mapped to the FTO gene. These loci were also found to be significant in the meta-analysis for BF% and HF, showing genetic overlaps between BF% and CVD-related traits. The third strongest signal was observed closest to the MC4R gene (index SNP rs663129, Pmeta = 3.10 × 10− 18), which is involved in the leptin signaling pathway and its disruption is a causal factor of obesity. \n\nGTEx TSEA\n\nIn order to assess whether shared genes between BF% and CVDs are enriched for expression in the disease-relevant tissue, we conducted the TSEA using the GTEx pilot data. We found that shared genes of BF% and HF had three significantly enriched tissues, including blood vessel, brain, and fallopian tube (Fig. 5). The shared genes of BF% and CAD were enriched in six tissues including blood vessel, brain, fallopian tube, heart, nerve, and uterus (Fig. 5). The most strongly enriched tissue for both BF% and HF or CAD was part of the cardiovascular and nervous system (Fig. 5). \n\nOver-representation enrichment analysis\n\nThe GO analysis indicated several significant shared biological processes between BF% and HF or CAD (false discovery rate < 0.05) such as glutathione derivative metabolic, glutathione derivative biosynthetic, and nitrobenzene metabolic processes (Table S5-S6). In additional analyses of Reactome pathways, we found that shared association signals for BF% and HF or CAD were significantly enriched in glutathione conjugation and plasma lipoprotein-related pathways (Table S7-S8). In general, the identified shared genes between BF and CVDs showed common significant enrichment in expression for glutathione metabolic-related pathways.\n\nFine-mapping and co-localization analysis\n\nLists of credible set SNPs in each shared locus for BF% and HF or CAD from fine mapping are shown in Table S9-S10. The co-localization analysis showed that 4 out of 5 loci and 16 out of 16 share causal variants between BF% and HF or CAD, respectively (Table S11-S12). The results of co-localization analysis were consistent with the cross-trait meta-analysis.\n\nSingle-trait TWAS\n\nWe conducted a TWAS analysis to examine if there are genes whose expression are related with BF%, CAD, and HF, and to determine if these genes are common among these traits. A total of 270 gene-tissue pairs were found across 44 GTEx tissues to be significantly associated with BF% after Benjamini-Hochberg correction (false discovery rate < 0.05), in addition to 786 gene-tissue pairs with CAD, and 270 gene-tissue pairs with HF (Fig. 6). Among these gene-tissue pairs, 32 overlapped between BF% and HF, most of which were observed in nervous and cardiovascular system (Table S17). Notably, C18orf8 and NPC1 are expressed in multiple tissues including brain, nerve, artery, and adipose tissue. Consistent with a previous study, NPC1 was validated as a shared genetic component in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health from our TWAS results. In addition, the methylation levels of C18orf8 were considered as an epigenetic mechanism in maternal obesity and early life origins of CVD and cancers. Furthermore, we identified 28 gene-tissue pairs that were shared by BF% and CAD (Table S17). Most of the associations were found in exo-/endocrine and digestive system. Some genes are expressed among multiple tissues such as ATP5G1, SLC22A3, SNF8, and UBE2Z. ATP5G1 has been shown to encode a subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase and SLC22A3 have been reported to be expressed at the blood-brain barrier and alters neuronal excitability. By integrating human and mouse results, previous studies have predicted that SNF8 and UBE2Z play a causal role in the development of CAD through a role in the vasculature. \n\nBidirectional MR\n\nWe conducted a bidirectional MR analysis to evaluate potential causal associations between BF% and HF and CAD. To assess the causal effect of BF% on HF and CAD, we used 10 previously identified genetic variants for BF% (Table S13). To assess the causal effect of HF and CAD on BF%, 5 and 24 previously identified genetic variants were used as instruments for HF and CAD, respectively (Table S14). We",

We found that genetically predicted BF% was causally associated with an increased risk of HF (OR 1.63 per 1-SD increase in BF%, P = 4.16 × 10− 04) (Table 4) after Bonferroni correction. However, HF was not causally associated with BF%. In addition, there were no causal relationships between BF% and the risk of CAD. Sensitivity analysis showed that our results were reliable and were not affected by horizontal pleiotropy or outliers (Table 4, Table S15-S16).",

    "content": "Results\n\nA total of 15,495 Japanese female subjects from four GWAS using different SNP genotyping systems were enrolled in this analysis. Characteristics of samples and genotyping methods are summarized in  Table 1 . All the subjects were of Japanese origin and obtained from the Biobank Japan Project. Samples consist of patients that were classified into 33 disease groups. The average and S.D. of AAM in each disease cohort is shown in Table S1. Some diseases such as breast cancer and osteoporosis are likely to be associated with early or late AAM, as reported previously. We also found that AAM was negatively associated with birth year (p<0.0001). Thus we used disease status and birth year as covariates in this study. Genotyping was performed with over 500,000 SNP markers using Illumina HumanHap 550 Genotyping BeadChip, Illumina610-Quad Genotyping BeadChip, or Illumina Omni Express (Illumina, CA, USA). We applied stringent quality control criteria as mentioned in the methods section. We also conducted principal component analysis to evaluate potential population stratification. To extend the genomic coverage and conduct meta-analysis, we subsequently performed a whole-genome imputation of the SNPs, using HapMap Phase II genotype data. After the imputation, we performed SNP quality control (minor allele frequency≥0.01 and an imputation score (Rsq value by MACH software)≥0.7) and found that more than two million autosomal SNPs satisfied these criteria.\n\nThe associations of these imputed SNPs with AAM were evaluated using a linear regression model and meta-analysis. Quantile-Quantile plots of P-values indicated the Inflation factors to be as low as 1.039 ( Figure 1 ), suggesting no substantial population stratification existed in our study population. Although we could not identify significant association that satisfied the genome-wide significant threshold (P<5×10−8), SNP rs364663 which is located within intron 2 of the LIN28B gene at 6q21 indicated the strongest association with a P-value of 5.49×10−7 ( Table 2 ,  Figure 2 ). SNP rs364663 exhibited the association with AAM in all four cohorts without significant heterogeneity in both effect sizes and directions (P-value for heterogeneity = 0.29;  Table 3 ), suggesting that the observed associations at LIN28B are not the result of false-positives due to study-specific bias. Regional p-value plots indicated that all of the AMM-associated SNPs were clustered around the LIN28B locus ( Figure 2 ). Previously reported SNPs rs314263 and rs7759938 near the LIN28B locus also associated with AAM (P = 1.03×10−6 and 1.12×10−6, respectively) in the same direction. In addition to the 6q21 locus, 17 SNPs in seven genomic regions exhibited suggestive association with a p-value of<1×10−5 ( Table 2 ). To further investigate the physiological role of these loci, the associations of these variations with body mass index (BMI) and height were evaluated using previously published results in 26,620 Japanese subjects. SNP rs9404590 near the LIN28B locus associated with height with p-value of 0.0003 (Table S2), but we did not find significant association (P<0.01) between these loci and BMI (Table S2).\n\nSince AAM is associated with various disease risks, we conducted separate analyses for each disease and then performed meta-analysis for the top 42 loci. As a result, some SNPs showed slightly stronger association, but none cleared the genome wide significant threshold (Table S3). Similar to the current study, our group had previously conducted QTL analyses using disease status as a covariate and successfully identified many QTL loci. Therefore, different background due to disease status was unlikely to significantly affect the result of association analysis.\n\nAdditionally, we examined the loci already known to show significant association with AAM in women of European ancestry. We selected 37 SNPs for this candidate analysis and successfully obtained the genotyping results of 33 SNPs ( Table 4 ), and the risk allele was consistent with previous reports for 31 SNPs. In addition, eight SNPs in or near RXRG, CCDC85A, LOC100421670, TMEM38B, ZNF483, ARNTL, and CA10 indicated possible associations with AAM (P<0.05). Among them, rs4452860 and rs7028916 at the TMEM38B locus exhibited significant association even after Bonferroni's correction (P<0.0015 = 0.05/33). Taken together, these variations as well as LIN28B are likely to be common AAM loci, although their effect sizes are different between women of European ancestry and those of Japanese.",

    "content": "Results\n\nGenome-wide association in lean type 2 diabetic individuals\n\nThree independent association signals reached P<2.5×10−8 in the lean case genome wide meta-analysis (Table 2). Two represented previously reported loci - TCF7L2 (OR = 1.58 [1.47–1.68], P = 2×10−40) and CDKAL1 (OR = 1.26 [1.17–1.35], P = 7×10−10). One novel locus reached genome-wide significance, lead SNP positioned ∼25 kb from the HLA-DQA2 gene (OR = 1.3 [1.19–1.42], P = 1×10−8). Three further independent signals reached P<5×10−7, two of which were previously identified (SNPs in or near ADCY5, OR = 1.25 [1.15–1.35] P = 6×10−8, and SLC30A8, OR = 1.23 [1.15–1.33] P = 4×10−8) and one of which was novel (SNPs in LAMA1, OR = 1.22 [1.12–1.30] P = 1×10−7). Rs numbers are given in Table 2.\n\nGenome-wide association in obese type 2 diabetic individuals\n\nIn the obese case genome wide meta-analysis, five signals reached genome-wide significance (Table 2), all in or near known loci TCF7L2, FTO, CDKAL1, HHEX, and IGF2BP2. A further three signals reached P<5×10−7; SNPs in or near the MC4R gene (previously associated with BMI), and two other signals; in HMG20A (previously reported in South Asians -OR = 1.14 [1.09–1.19] P = 2×10−7) and in ANKS1A (OR = 1.3 [1.18–1.43] P = 5×10−7).\n\nFollow-up of putative novel signals\n\nWe sought to replicate the signals reaching P<5×10−7 not previously reported in Europeans. SNPs representing the LAMA1 (rs8090011), HLA-DQA2 (rs3916765), HMG20A (rs7178572), and ANKS1A (rs16896390) signals were genotyped in up to 2,881 lean cases, 8,702 obese cases and 18,957 control individuals. Combined discovery and follow-up association statistics for these SNPs are shown in Table 2. In the lean case analysis, the LAMA1 variant was associated with type 2 diabetes (combined P = 8.4×10−9, OR = 1.13 [1.09–1.18], total lean cases N = 4,993, controls = 70,515) compared to an OR = 1.03 [1.00–1.06] in the obese case analysis (Figure 1 and Figure 2). In the obese case analysis, the HMG20A signal was associated with type 2 diabetes (combined P = 1.3×10−8, OR = 1.11 [1.07–1.15], total obese cases N = 8,583, controls = 62,063) compared to an OR = 1.09 [1.02–1.17], P = 0.015, in the lean analysis (Figure 3 and Figure 4). In previously published studies including 8,130 cases not stratified by BMI, the LAMA1 and HMG20A variants reached only nominal levels of significance of P = 0.002 (OR = 1.07 [1.03–1.12]) and P = 0.003, OR = 1.07 [1.02–1.12] respectively (both in the same directions as reported here).\n\nConsidering a random-effects model for both LAMA1 and HMG20A signals gave similar evidence for association (LAMA1 lean analysis: P = 5×10−10, obese analysis: P = 0.02; HMG20A lean analysis: P = 0.04, obese analysis: P = 2.7×10−8). Evidence for association at the HLA-DQA2 and ANKS1A signals was reduced when follow-up data were included.\n\nAssociation of variants with BMI\n\nWe next attempted to understand further the associations between SNPs in the LAMA1 and HMG20A loci and lean and obese type 2 diabetes cases respectively. Our study design, together with the associations between the FTO and MC4R variants in the obese strata, suggested that variants that primarily operate through BMI could drive our newly identified associations. We therefore assessed the two signals in the existing GWA studies of BMI performed by the GIANT study and consisting of 123,865 individuals. The LAMA1 SNP was not associated with BMI (P = 0.19) whilst the type 2 diabetes risk allele at the HMG20A SNP was nominally associated with increased BMI (P = 0.02).\n\nAssociation of variants with BMI within cases only\n\nIf the associations at the LAMA1 and HMG20A loci are genuinely stronger in one strata of diabetic cases compared to the other, we should observe an association of those variants with BMI within cases only.

This phenomenon has previously been reported for the variants in TCF7L2[14]. The LAMA1 type 2 diabetes risk allele was associated with lower BMI within cases alone (P = 2×10−6 when analysing BMI as a quantitative trait in 26,366 cases), a result consistent with its association being stronger in the lean case analysis. The HMG20A risk allele showed no evidence of association (P>0.05).\n\nAssociation of variants with continuous glycaemic measures\n\nNext we used data from MAGIC to assess potential roles of variants in normal glycaemia. The SNP representing the novel LAMA1 association showed no association with fasting glucose (P = 0.48, beta(se) = 0.0027(0.004) N = 46,186), fasting insulin (P = 0.87, beta(se) = 0.0006(0.004) N = 38,238), HbA1C (P = 0.19, beta(se) = 0.005(0.004) N = 46,368), 2-hour glucose response (P = 0.43, beta(se) = −0.016(0.02), N = 15,234), or any of the SNP×BMI-interaction models. However, LAMA1 isn't unique amongst type 2 diabetes loci in showing no effect on glycemic traits in the MAGIC study.\n\nThe HMG20A diabetes risk allele was associated with higher fasting glucose (P = 0.04, beta(se) = 0.008(0.004), N = 46,186), higher HbA1C (P = 0.002, beta(se) = 0.01(0.004), N = 46,368) and higher fasting glucose after accounting for BMI and SNPxBMI interaction (P = 0.008, N = 58,074).\n\nAssociation of variants with cis gene expression levels\n\nIn an attempt to gain further insight into likely functional genes in the LAMA1 and HMG20A loci, we tested the lead SNPs at for association in a number of eQTL datasets. Tissues tested included various blood, brain, liver and fat samples (see Methods). Only ‘cis’ associations were considered (eQTL effects on a transcript within 1 Mb of the signal SNPs). The rs7178572 SNP in the HMG20A region was significantly associated with mRNA expression levels of HMG20A in the liver (P = 4×10−5), supported by two separate expression probes, and was the strongest known regional SNP for both the liver eQTL and type 2 diabetes. No other study-wide significant results were observed (N = 14 tissues, 24 datasets/analyses).\n\nEvidence that genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes have different effects between lean and obese cases\n\nFor each of 36 published type 2 diabetes loci (identified in European studies and available on the metabochip) we compared the effect sizes between the lean and obese GWA study meta-analyses (Table 3). Among the 36 independent variants, 29 had a larger point estimate odds ratio in the lean analysis compared to the obese analysis (binomial test of 29/36 versus 50% under the null hypothesis of no difference, P = 0.0002). We next assessed the combined effect of these SNPs in a case control study independent of the GWA studies - GoDARTs (Figure 5). In the lean stratum, we observed a weighted per-risk allele OR = 1.13 [1.10–1.17], P = 3.2×10−14. This was larger than the same model fitted in the obese strata where the OR = 1.06 [1.05–1.08], P = 2.2×10−16. Results were very similar when stratifying the controls as well as the cases by BMI: lean weighted per risk-allele OR = 1.13 [1.09–1.17]; obese weighted per risk-allele OR = 1.08 [1.05–1.10] (heterogeneity of odds ratios P = 0.036). We also observed a difference between lean and obese cases when removing controls and fitting a regression model of lean cases vs obese cases (P = 0.0001). None of these 36 variants were associated with BMI in 28,000–32,000 individuals from GIANT.\n\nWe next divided the case/control samples into risk quintiles, based on the number of risk alleles they carry, weighted by the relative effect sizes of those alleles from the larger DIAGRAM meta-analysis. The risk of being in each quintile relative to the median quintile is shown in Figure 6. For the lean group, we observed an OR = 2.1 [1.47–3.01] for the quintile of individuals carrying the most risk alleles compared to the middle quintile. This effect was larger than that in the obese group where the equivalent OR = 1.37 [1.15",

The frequencies of the rs1799945 G allele were significantly higher in Russian (21.0 vs 13.2%; P = 0.0002) and Japanese (7.5 vs 2.5%; P = 0.0032) endurance athletes compared to ethnically matched controls (Table 1). Furthermore, the rs1799945 CG/GG genotypes were significantly over- represented in Russian (38.0 vs 24.9%; OR 1.85, P = 0.0003) and Japanese (13.3 vs 5.0%; OR 2.95, P = 0.011) endurance athletes compared to ethnically matched controls (Table 2). These results remained statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.\n\nMeta-analysis\n\nMulti-database literature search yielded three eligible studies involving endurance athletes that were genotyped for the HFE gene H63D polymorphism. These involved 77 French elite road cyclists and 254 controls (Deugnier et al.); 65 Spanish highly trained athletes (50 professional road cyclists and 15 Olympic class endurance runners) and 134 controls (sedentary men from Spain) (Chicharro et al.) and 129 French elite athletes (Nordic skiing, rowing, fighting) and 219 controls (Hermine et. al.). The genotypic frequencies for both the cases and the controls in all studies were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nThe frequencies of the rs1799945 CG/GG genotypes were significantly higher in three groups of French and Spanish endurance athletes compared to controls (Table 2). Overall, five case–control studies (two current and three previous) including a total number of 586 endurance athletes and 1416 controls were used for the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for the CG/GG genotypes compared to the CC genotype was 1.95 (95% CI 1.57–2.43, P = 2.5 × 10–9 for the fixed effect model) and 1.96 (95% CI 1.58–2.45, P = 1.7 × 10–9 for the random effect model) (Fig. 1). No heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 0%; P = 0.83) was observed. These results indicate that the carriage of the HFE mutation (i.e. CG/GG genotypes) is strongly associated with endurance athlete status.\n\nAerobic study\n\nWe identified that the HFE gene rs1799945 G allele was significantly associated with increased V̇O2max in the whole group of Russian male endurance athletes (CC [n = 29]: 61.8 (6.1), CG/GG [n = 17]: 66.3 (7.8) ml/min/kg; P = 0.036), as well as in long-distance athletes only (CC [n = 8]: 68.1 (3.4), CG/GG [n = 7]: 73.0 (4.6) ml/min/kg; P = 0.038).",

    "content": "Results\n\nPhenotypic Characterization of Cdkal1-knockout Mice\n\nExpression of Cdkal1 was found to be relatively ubiquitous in mice. Cdkal1 mRNA was prominently expressed in the skeletal muscle, pancreatic islets, and heart (Figures 1B and 1C), as previously reported in humans. Here, CDKAL1 protein was confirmed to be detectable in Cdkal1 +/+but not in Cdkal1 −/− mice (Figure S1C) as previously reported. Genotype analysis of 91 pups generated by cross-breeding heterozygous Cdkal1 +/− mice demonstrated that 21 mice were Cdkal1 +/+, 46 were Cdkal1 +/− and 24 were Cdkal1 −/−, a distribution consistent with Mendelian inheritance. The locomotor activities of Cdkal1 −/− mice were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates (Figure S2) and no gross anatomical changes were observed either externally or in the major organs.\n\n Table 1 summarizes the phenotypes in these animals. On a standard diet, although the effects on body weight were relatively modest (i.e., reduction by 2–5%) in Cdkal1 −/− mice compared to wild-type littermates (see Figure 2A), we observed significant, symmetrical increases of body weight in Cdkal1 transgenic mice, which we further generated (Text S1 and Figure S1). This supported the possible involvement of Cdkal1 in the regulation of body weight. No significant changes in plasma lipids, glucose, or insulin were observed in Cdkal1 −/− mice relative to wild-type littermates. On a high-fat (high-saturated fat/low-carbohydrate) diet, Cdkal1 −/− mice also tended to be lighter throughout the follow-up period. In particular, Cdkal1 −/− mice showed a significant reduction in fat accumulation, monitored by %intraabdominal and %subcutaneous fat, after 8 weeks on the high-fat diet, i.e., 16 weeks of age (see Figures 2B and 2C). These findings were further supported by reduced lipid accumulation (as estimated by triglyceride content) in the liver and muscle at the corresponding time point (Figure S3). Inversely, at a later stage (20 weeks) of high-fat feeding, lipid accumulation became more prominent in Cdkal1 −/− mice than wild-type littermates (Figure S3). Food intake tended to be reduced in Cdkal1 −/−mice (Table 1).\n\nDuring the follow-up period, Cdkal1 −/−mice caught up with wild-type littermates in %intraabdominal fat after 16 weeks on the high-fat diet (Figure 2C). Plasma glucose and insulin levels remained lower in Cdkal1 −/−mice over almost the entire follow-up period, except that plasma insulin eventually increased in Cdkal1 −/−mice after 20 weeks on the high-fat diet. At this time point, despite almost equivalent levels of insulin, and %intraabdominal and %subcutaneous fat between the strains, plasma leptin levels tended to be higher in Cdkal1 −/−mice than wild-type littermates (28.1±1.1 ng/ml vs. 31.2±1.2 ng/ml for wild-type littermates vs. Cdkal1 −/− mice, P = 0.078). They did not accompany the expected increases in TNF-α (Table 1), whose circulatory levels are known to generally increase with the degree of obesity. On a high-fat diet, Cdkal1 −/−mice were more insulin-sensitive than wild-type littermates until a certain time point; that is, a lower glucose level was attainable with a significantly (P = 0.015) lower insulin level despite almost equivalent fat accumulation after 16 weeks on the high-fat diet (Figure 2C).\n\nGlucose Homeostasis and Insulin Release in vivo \n\nOn a standard diet, no apparent impairment of glucose tolerance was observed in Cdkal1 −/−mice at 12 and 20 weeks of age (Figure S4A and S4B). While a modest (but not significant) decrease in plasma glucose was seen at 60–120 min after insulin injection at both ages in Cdkal1 −/−mice relative to wild-type littermates, insulin sensitivity was almost indistinguishable between the two strains on a standard diet (Figure S4C and S4D). On a high-fat diet, elevated fasting glucose levels and glucose intolerance during OGTT were seen in both strains at an early stage (after 4 and 8 weeks) of high-fat feeding, which was more prominent in wild-type littermates than Cdkal1 −/− mice (Figure S4E and S4F). Also, in wild-type littermates on a high-fat diet, insulin sensitivity assessed by ITT deteriorated more markedly (Figure S4G and S4H). However, at a later stage (after 20 weeks) of high-fat feeding (Figure 3), the impairment of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity became more prominent in Cdkal1 −/− mice than wild-type littermates (P<0.05; Figures 3A and 3C), contrary to the findings at the early stage. Insulin secretion during OGTT was reduced in Cdkal1 −/− mice on a high-fat diet (in particular, at an early stage of high-fat feeding) but not on a standard diet (Figure 3B and Figure S4I and S4J).\n\nInsulin Secretion in Perfused Pan",

In wild-type littermates (Cdkal1 +/+), 16.7 mmol/L glucose elicited insulin secretion [the amount of secreted insulin (AUCinsulin) after glucose stimulation (from 3 to 20 min); 130±18 ng in 17 min, n = 6], which was further potentiated by 4 weeks of high-fat feeding [AUCinsulin; 212±18 ng, n = 6, P<0.01 vs. standard diet] (Figure 4C). In Cdkal1 −/− mice, 16.7 mmol/L glucose elicited insulin secretion almost equivalently to Cdkal1 +/+mice on a standard diet (AUCinsulin; 151±19 ng, n = 8), whereas there was no apparent potentiation of insulin secretion after 4 weeks of high-fat feeding (AUCinsulin; 147±14 ng, n = 6). Thus, based on an assessment of AUCinsulin, high-fat feeding did not potentiate insulin secretion in Cdkal1 −/− mice (1.0-fold), contrary to the findings in Cdkal1 +/+mice (1.6-fold), although glucose tolerance was impaired in both strains as compared to the situation on a standard diet (Figure 4C and Figure S4A and S4E). It remains to be determined whether such inter-strain differences in impaired insulin secretion are reproducible in mice high-fat fed for 20 weeks, at which time points insulin sensitivity in Cdkal1 −/− mice became worse and almost equivalent to that in Cdkal1 +/+mice (Figure 2C). Nevertheless, the present findings in perfusion experiments after 4 weeks of high-fat diet appeared to be consistent with the results for in vitro experiments (using batch incubated β cells) in the previous study.\n\nChanges Associated with Protection Against Diet-induced Obesity and Insulin Resistance in Cdkal1 −/− Mice\n\nTo understand biological mechanisms, by which Cdkal1 −/− mice could show protection against high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, we performed microarray gene expression analysis on the muscle, along with comparing mRNA expression of target genes (including several physiological candidate genes) in brown adipose tissues (BAT) and WAT, liver and muscle between Cdkal1 +/+and Cdkal1 −/− mice (Figure 5). Although there were significant (P<0.05) inter-strain differences in mRNA expression of a few candidate genes, e.g., Adrb3 in BAT and Ucp2 in the liver, they did not appear to be causal, considering the pattern of expression differences. In the microarray analysis, we identified an Scd1 gene among a list of most significant genes differentially expressed (Table S3). Scd1 was confirmed to be down-regulated in muscle and WAT of Cdkal1 −/− mice (Figure 5).\n\nNext, to test whether protection against high fat diet-induced insulin resistance is mediated by enhanced insulin signaling, we examined insulin-dependent Akt activation. We found that the levels of phosphorylated Akt protein were comparable between the strains when fed on a high-fat diet for 4 weeks (Figure S5).\n\nCorrelation of type 2 Diabetes and BMI Associations at Candidate Loci\n\nIn the Japanese general population samples (Table 2), we found significant (P<0.05/7 ≈ 0.007) associations with BMI at CDKAL1 rs4712523 and KCNQ1 rs2237892, and nominal (P<0.05) associations at 2 other loci–CDKN2A/B rs2383208 and TCF7L2 rs7903146 (Table 3). At CDKAL1, we evaluated the association of rs4712523, which showed the strongest association in our previous GWA study of type 2 diabetes, with BMI and found reproducible evidence for association in 2 independent panels (Table 3), where the risk allele (G of rs4712523) for type 2 diabetes showed nominal association with lower BMI [P = 0.024 in the Amagasaki panel (n = 5,695) and P = 0.02 in the Fukuoka panel (n = 12,569)]. Even when restricted to non-diabetic individuals, the effect sizes were almost unchanged as compared to those calculated in the whole panel (Table S4). When we reanalyzed the BMI association at CDKAL1 by arbitrarily categorizing the samples into two age groups (age<60 years and age≥60 years) without adjusting for age in the linear regression, there was no statistically significant inter-age-group difference (P heterogeneity = 0.56, Table 3). In addition, the “inverse” correlation between disease risk and lower BMI was replicated for 6 other type 2 diabetes risk loci, which had been all suggested to affect insulin secretion (Figure 6).

In addition, the “inverse” correlation between disease risk and lower BMI was replicated for 6 other type 2 diabetes risk loci, which had been all suggested to affect insulin secretion (Figure 6). There was, on the other hand, a positive correlation between type 2 diabetes risk and higher BMI for 2 obesity (or insulin resistance)-associated loci–FTO and MC4R–as previously reported.\n\nMeta-analysis of Effect Size for type 2 Diabetes at the CDKAL1 Locus\n\nIn the longitudinal follow-up, Cdkal1 −/− mice gained adipose tissues and showed the deterioration of insulin sensitivity after a certain period of extreme high-fat feeding (Figure 2C). Analogously in the human, as dietary habits substantially influence BMI in the population at large, genetic effects on type 2 diabetes, attributable to CDKAL1, may differ between populations (or ethnic groups) with distinct dietary habits and the resultant cross-population diversity in BMI. To evaluate this possibility, we plotted effect sizes for type 2 diabetes against BMI in the control group (as the population mean data) for the individual case-control studies that investigated disease association at CDKAL1 (Figure 7). There was a tendency toward inverse correlation between the 2 tested variables. As a consequence, we identified significant cross-population heterogeneity in effect sizes (I2 = 96.4%, P<1.4×10−7) between East Asians (a relatively thin population, mean BMI = 23.3 kg/m2; OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.23–1.30) and Europeans (a relatively stout population, mean BMI = 26.4 kg/m2; OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.10–1.17) at CDKAL1 (Table S5).",

Subjects with diabetes accounted for 27% of participants, and the weighted T2D-GRS ranged from 21.02 to 49.39 with an average of 34.56. As for the fruit intake levels, 2061 (18%) participants were in the first level (< 1 times/week), 3075 (26%) in the second (1–3/week), and 6521 (56%) in the third (> 3 times/week).\n\nThe demographic and biochemical characteristic of the study participants was presented in Supplemental Table 2. The T2D-GRS, BMI, SBP, DBP, FPG, 2 h-PG, and log-HOMA-IR were significantly lower in the higher level of fruit intake group, while the HDL-C and Log-HOMA-β were higher along with the higher level of fruit intake (all P < 0.01). Women took fruit more frequently than men (P < 0.0001). In addition, in the higher frequency fruit intake group, the diabetes prevalence was significantly declined.\n\nMultiple logistic regression analyses showed that, each 1-point increase in T2D-GRS was associated with 8.0% [odds ration (OR), 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07–1.09] increment of the risk of diabetes in Model 1, and the results were the same in Model 2. And each 1-level higher fruit intake, namely, every one categorical increment we defined before, was associated with a 31% (OR 0.69; CI 0.65–0.73) lower of diabetes risk in Model 1, and 36% (OR 0.64; CI 0.60–0.68) in Model 2.\n\nWe detected a significant T2D-GRS and fruit intake interaction in the risk of T2D (P for interaction = 0.03 in Model 1 and 0.04 in Model 2). The ORs of diabetes for each 1-point increase in T2D-GRS were attenuating progressively as the fruit intake levels ascended. Specifically, in Model 1, the OR of diabetes was 1.10 (CI 1.07–1.13) in the first fruit intake level (< 1 times/week), 1.07 (CI 1.05–1.10) in the second level (1–3/week), and 1.07 (CI 1.05–1.08) in the third level (> 3 times/week); in Model 2, the corresponding value was 1.10 (CI 1.07–1.13), 1.08 (CI 1.05–1.10), and 1.07 (CI 1.05–1.08) (Fig. 1).\n\nTable 1 shows the association of fruit intake with the risk of diabetes stratified by T2D-GRS tertiles. Higher fruit intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of T2D; and such effect was increasingly sharper as the tertile ascended (P for interaction ≤ 0.04). In the full adjusted model (Model 2), for participants in the lowest tertile of T2D-GRS, > 3 times/week fruit intake was associated with about 56% lower risk of T2D (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.35, 0.56) as compared to < 1 times/week (P < 0.0001); the corresponding ORs were 0.40 (0.33–0.50) in participants at tertile 2 of T2D-GRS and decreased to 0.34 (0.27–0.41) in those at tertile 3 of T2D-GRS (both P < 0.0001) (P for interaction = 0.04).\n\nAlthough the P for interaction of the sensitivity analyses using subpopulations with no self-awareness of T2D (P = 0.34) or no dietary interventions for T2D (P = 0.10) failed to pass the significant threshold given the loss of sample size, the trends of variation from the lower to the higher strata were in highly consistent with the analysis outcome in the integral population (Supplemental Tables 3, 4).\n\nBy taking participants in the first T2D-GRS tertile with the highest fruit intake level as a reference, we further tested the risk of diabetes for combination of each tertile of T2D-GRS and fruit intake level. In general, the risk of diabetes presence gradually increased in lower fruit intake level and higher of T2D-GRS tertile, and it was maximized for those with both fruit intake level of < 1 times/week and highest tertile of T2D-GRS (OR 5.15, 95% CI 4.23–6.29) (Fig. 2).\n\nTable 2 shows the association of T2D-GRS with the glucose metabolism related traits stratified by fruit intake levels.

The effect size of the association of GRS with T2D was decreased along with increase of fruit intake; all P for interaction < 0.0001. Given the potential influence of antidiabetic agents and lifestyle changes after diagnosis of T2D, we further adjusted self-awareness of diabetes, diet and exercise intervention for diabetes, and diabetic treatment in the Model 3, the results did not appreciably change (all P for interaction ≤ 0.03) (Table 2). The cubic spline analysis of association of GRS with FBG, 2 h-PG and A1c (Fig. 3a–c) and linear association of tertiles of GRS (Fig. 3d–f) with these metabolic traits by 3 fruit intake levels confirmed the above findings.\n\nWe also analyzed the interaction of GRS and fruit intake in influencing Log-HOMA-β and Log-HOMA-IR level (Table 2). After the full adjustments (Model 3), we did not find a significant interaction effect of GRS and fruit intake, though in each stratum of fruit intake level, the GRS was significantly associated with a lower HOMA-β level (both P ≤ 0.003).\n\nThe association of fruit intake level with FPG, 2 h-PG, HbA1c, Log-HOMA-β, and Log-HOMA-IR stratified by the T2D-GRS tertiles was displayed in Supplemental Table 5. Briefly, in Model 3, the association of fruit intake with FPG, 2 h-PG and HbA1c were more prominent in the higher tertile of GRS (all P for interaction ≤ 0.05).

Therefore, we further tested the interactive effect of rs10906115 at CDC123/CAMK1D and rs7172432 at C2CD4B/C2CD4A with fruit intake level on FPG, 2 h-PG, HbA1c, Log-HOMA-β, and Log-HOMA-IR with full adjustments (Model 3).

    "content": "Results and discussion\n\nSimulation Study\n\nWe conducted a power study based on 1,000 Genomes data (August 2010 release), in order to obtain realistic linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. We used the chromosome 22 data of the 288 individuals of European descent (CEU sample) as a “master” data set M. In general, we simulated series of new data sets Mi by random re-assignment of cases-control status, so that each Mi consisted of 144 cases and 144 controls. For each data set, we conducted a single-marker analysis on Mi and identified the smallest p-value  obtained for any of the SNPs in Mi. In case  was smaller than 1×10−6, we kept the simulated data set for further analysis. We stopped the simulation process when 500 data sets with  had been obtained. In order to compare the relative performance of the proxy algorithm and imputing we investigated to what degree  could be retrieved in a meta-analysis. For this purpose, Mi was split into two “studies” Ai and Bi, each involving only 144 individuals. In addition, for Ai SNP information was kept only for SNPs from the Illumina® Human660WQuad v1 panel, and for Bi, SNP information was kept only for Affymetrix® 6.0 chip content. Meta-analysis of Ai and Bi was then performed either using only the SNPs available in both panels (MA-intersection), or using the proxy algorithm (MA-proxy), or based on Ai and Bi imputed with the IMPUTE software using the 1,000 Genomes data (MA-impute). The comparison of the three MA strategies was then based on their potential to recapture the association signal in the complete master sample. To meet this purpose, the p-values ,  and  were defined by the smallest p-values obtained within the 100 kb window around the top signal  of the master file. The window size was chosen since LD typically extends about 50 kb. Therefore, we investigated the regions 50 kb upstream and downstream of the top signal. Nominal “power” was then evaluated based on the minP values: we counted the fraction of data sets for which minP was smaller than α ∈{0.01,0.001,..,1×10−6}. For comparison, we will show also the power values that would be obtained when both studies A and B had been genotyped for all SNPs of the 1,000 Genomes panel (LIMIT). That reflects the upper limit of what the meta-analysis approaches could have reached. Adjustment for the number of SNPs within the 100 kb window was not performed. In particular, minPMA−proxy and minPMA−impute were treated equally, even though more SNPs were considered with imputation-based MA. Thus, MA-imputed was favored in a way by our power definition. However, in practice a significance level of 5×10−8 is the consensus to establish genome-wide significance, irrespective of the number of SNPs actually tested. Therefore, it seems to be appropriate not to adjust for the varying amount of SNPs tested when comparing different MA strategies.\n\nWe tried to mimic different scenarios of potential reference panels, an “ideal”, an “incomplete” and a “mismatched” one. First, the “ideal” reference panel represents a perfect and complete match of the haplotype distribution between the study and the reference data. The “ideal” reference panel consisted of exactly the same haplotypes as the master file. In practice, the reference data will contain only a fraction of the haplotypes that are actually present in the study population, simple because of the limited size of the reference samples. Therefore, our “incomplete” reference consisted only of a third of the haplotypes present in the master file, in order to mimic a real data analysis situation. Third, the “mismatched” reference consisted only of the haplotypes of African descent (YRI sample) and was included to investigate the robustness against poorly fitting reference panels.\n\nRunning Time\n\nRunning time was evaluated on a cluster with 400 CPUs (2.4 Ghz, 2GB RAM). In Table 1, running time estimates (unix time command, real time) from analysis with YAMAS are listed. Analysis of the Type II Diabetes data (first line of Table 1, 6 studies) took 2 minutes and 5 seconds with the point-wise approach, and 92 minutes and 5 seconds with the proxy-algorithm, using a single CPU. In order to investigate running time in correlation with the number of studies, we increased the meta-analysis to 12 (24) studies by using each of the original dbGaP studies twice (four times). Running time of the point-wise algorithm is about proportional in the number of investigated studies: increasing the number of studies by a factor of 4 leads to an increase in running time from 2m5s to 6m56s, which corresponds to factor of 3.35. The running time of the proxy-algorithm grows only moderately with an increasing number of studies. For 24 studies, the running time is only about 8 minutes longer than with 6 studies. This is because most of the running time is needed for reading, indexing and storing the proxy reference file, which has to be done only once. We conclude that the proxy-algorithm can be run even with a large number of studies within less than two hours. In addition, several algorithms and data processing routines are parallelized, based upon the OpenMP project, such that the YAMAS running time can be further improved if required by the user.\n\nWe wish to contrast the running time of the proxy-algorithm of 92m5s (6 studies) to that of imputation.",

In addition, several algorithms and data processing routines are parallelized, based upon the OpenMP project, such that the YAMAS running time can be further improved if required by the user.\n\nWe wish to contrast the running time of the proxy-algorithm of 92m5s (6 studies) to that of imputation. Imputation was carried out in chunks using IMPUTEv2. We used 300 CPUs such that we were able to analyze each in one go. The average running time of a chunk was 20 hours. Since 6 studies had to be analyzed, 300 CPUs run 120 hours, each. In addition, association analysis ran 5 hours on average per chromosome, using PLINK, i.e., 22 CPUs were needed for 30 hours, in addition. In total, but ignoring extra running time for merging of chunks, imputation and association testing took 300 · 20 · 6 + 22 · 5 · 6 = 36,600 CPU-hours which is 23,921 more than what is needed with the proxy-approach. When one assumes that ample CPUs are available to impute all chunks of one study in parallel, the running time the user actually has to wait is 20 · 6 + 5 · 6 = 150 hours, ignoring overhead that is need to check and format the data for association testing. Thus, even when a cluster with hundreds of CPUs is available, running time improves by a factor of almost one hundred with the proxy-algorithm (150h/92m5s=98).\n\nResults from Simulation Study\n\nIn Table 2 results from simulations under the null hypothesis are shown. None of the investigated methods exceeds the nominal level, of either α = 0.0 or α= 0.01, irrespective of the reference file that is chosen. In particular, there is no evidence for inflated type I error with the new proxy algorithm. This was also true when the r2-limit for a SNP and its proxy was relaxed from 0.80 to 0.50 (data not shown). We conclude that the proxy approach is a valid method. Of notice, all methods are too conservative when a random effects model is used. This is in concordance with a recent publication in which is was shown that the random effects model tests an inappropriately strict null hypothesis.\n\nThe results from our power study are depicted in Figures 1, 2 and 3. The x-axis displays various α-levels on a logarithmic scale, moving from higher to lower levels. The y-axis displays power levels.\n\nWhen an ideal reference panel is used (Figure 1), MA with imputing strongly outperforms naïve MA restricted to the joint marker panel (MA-intersection). Thus, imputing is highly recommendable. Nevertheless, the power level with MA-impute is considerably lower than power that can be achieved with a hypothetical sample that genotyped for all 1,000 Genomes SNPs (LIMIT). Thus, our simulation study also confirms the claim that imputing cannot replace complete genotyping or sequencing. MA-proxy clearly outperforms MA-intersection, but is, as expected, less powerful than MA-impute. This is partly due to, first, the smaller marker panel that MA-proxy can analyze, and, second, that in case of incomplete LD the proxy marker will not necessarily reflect the true effect size.\n\nIn the presumably most realistic scenario (incomplete reference, Figure 2), we still see an impressive power gain with MA-impute when compared to MA-intersection. The performance of MA-proxy now comes much closer to that of MA-impute than with unrealistic “ideal” reference panel. We conclude that the proxy algorithm can yield valuable ad hoc results at an early analysis stage.\n\nThirdly, considering the mismatched reference panel (Figure 3), it is noteworthy, that MA-impute and MA-proxy still markedly outperform naïve MA. Obviously, even distant ethnical groups still share common LD patterns that can be useful in extending SNP information. Of note, there is no longer a measurable difference between the performance of MA-proxy and MA-impute. In summary, the difference between MA-impute and MA-proxy becomes smaller with reduced fit of the reference panel with the data. This is plausible: the imputing approach is the more sophisticated one, taking into account higher-order LD, whereas the proxy algorithm uses only pairwise LD information. Thus, the relative performance of the imputing approach will be the better the more closer its assumption “concordance of the study and reference haplotype set” is fulfilled. In contrast, the proxy algorithm uses a rougher metric, and, therefore, is more robust to peculiar mismatches in haplotype structure. As a consequence, the proxy algorithm can be recommended as an alternative main approach when a close-fitting reference panel is not available.\n\nAnalysis of Type II Diabetes dbGaP Data\n\nWe examined the performance of the proxy approach on the basis of six Type II Diabetes GWAS studies that were available from dbGaP, cf. Table 3. The six GWAS studies belong to three different projects.\n\nThere are two projects of the Northwestern NUgene Project Type 2 Diabetes from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), each of which contributed 2 studies to our analysis. The “Project Health Research - Vanderbilt University” project provided two studies from different platforms. Data generated with the Illumina® Human660W-Quad v1 chip comprised 607 individuals and 499,350 markers. Another fraction of patients were examined with the Illumina® Human1M-Duo v3 array, for which 1384 individuals and 919,602 SNPs remained after",

Another fraction of patients were examined with the Illumina® Human1M-Duo v3 array, for which 1384 individuals and 919,602 SNPs remained after quality control (QC). The same arrays were used for the second project, the “Northwestern NUgene Project”. Here, 1,239 individuals with 495,588 from the Human660W-Quad v1 array were available after QC, and, 267 individuals with 908,692 markers were available for Human1M-Duo v3. Finally the third project “GENEVA Diabetes Study”, comprised two further studies, the Nurses Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). After provided quality control (QC), 3,435 individuals and 764,679 SNPs were available for NHS, and 2,606 individuals and 787,213 SNPs were available for HPFS. Both studies were performed on the Affymetrix® Human SNP Array 6.0. In total, data from three different platforms with different marker content were used in six GWAS studies.\n\nThe dbGaP data was analyzed with naïve MA (MA-intersection), i.e., conventional MA restricted to the joint marker panel, with the proxy algorithm (MA-proxy), and based on data imputed with IMPUTEv2, using 1,000 Genomes reference data. We relied on the QC data available from dbGaP, since our focus was on the relative performance of the various MA approaches rather than on the detection of novel associations.\n\nOnly 141,105 SNPs were available in all six studies and 561,282 SNPs were available in at least four studies. The proxy approach enabled the analysis of 1,427,514 SNPs and SNP/SNP–proxy combinations, whereof 1,0464,482 were available in all six studies and 1,279,702 were available in at least four studies. More than 85% of the proxies had an r2 greater than 0.8 with the substituted SNP.\n\nOur philosophy was to compare the performance of the methods on Type II Diabetes genes that the community considers to be “undoubtedly” confirmed. To this purpose, we used the catalog of published GWAS results provided by the American National Human Genome Research Institute. The catalog lists 33 Type II Diabetes GWAS genes/LD regions (“gene regions”) with at least one SNP that meets the genome-wide significance criterion of 5×10−8. For each of these gene regions, we investigated the 100 kb up- and downstream region of the SNP reported to be most significant and computed minPMA−impute and minPMA−proxy for the six studies available for us. Of note, a considerable part of the 33 genes was identified by meta-analysis efforts and shows only moderate odds ratios. As a consequence, it cannot be expected that all the genes show measurable association effects within the smaller data sets we analyzed. In other words, not all the genes will be informative for the evaluation of the performance of the two meta-analysis approaches. Therefore, we restricted our comparison to gene regions that reached a significance level of 0.05 with at least one method.\n\nIn Table 4, 22 such gene regions are shown, together with the minimum p-values for all approaches. For 16 of the gene regions, MA-proxy yields a more significant result than MA-intersection. For TCF7L2 for instance, minP improves from 3.2×10−19 to 1.5×10−22, a change by a factor of 2127. In total, there are 6 gene regions with a p-value improvement of at least a factor of 10, including FTO, IRS1, JAZF1, KCNJ11, and KCNQ1. For KCNQ1, we observe p = 0.021 with MA-intersection and p = 0.00027 with MA-proxy,\n\nan increase in significance by a factor of 78.6. For another 11 genes we observe an improvement with the proxy algorithm by a factor ranging from 2.18 (TSPAN8/LGR5) to 8.46 (JAZF1). There are also 5 gene regions for which no difference between MA-intersection and MA-proxy can be observed. In these cases, the most significant SNP is available in all 6 studies and, therefore, MA-intersection and MA-proxy coincide. Finally, for TSPAN8/LGR5, significance slightly decreases from 0.012 to 0.008. In summary, MA-proxy outperforms MA-intersection in the majority of cases and we observe an average (median) improvement of the level of significance of 107.1 (3.33), demonstrating the usefulness of proxy-SNPs.\n\nImputation-based MA outperforms MA-proxy in 19 out of 22 cases and we observe an average (median) improvement of the level of significance of 19.1 (2.79). In two cases, imputing outperforms the proxy-algorithm by a factor of more than 100, SLC30A8 (193) and HMGA2 (149.8), and in another case by a factor of 21.7 (SPRY2) which demonstrates the usefulness of long-range LD for association analysis.

For three genes, FTO, KCNQ1 and RBSM1/ITGB6, the proxy-algorithm even performs slightly better than MA-impute. In summary, one can say that the proxy algorithm yields good approximations of the actual level of significance in the majority of cases and that it is a potentially useful screening algorithm.\n\nTable 5 contains a detailed example that explains the idea of proxy-SNPs for rs7903146 which is located within the gene of transcription factor TCF7L2, which has an essential function in the Wnt signaling pathway. This SNP is described in several GWAS to be significantly associated with the risk of Type II Diabetes. P-values up to 2×10−51 are reported. In our dbGaP analysis, rs7903146(A/G) is present in studies 1-4, but not in studies 5 and 6. However, those studies contain rs4506565(T/A) which, according to 1,000 Genomes data, has an r2 of 0.945 with rs7903146 and which is located only 2.3 kb downstream. Moreover, the A-T haplotype has a frequency of 0.668, while under linkage equilibrium a frequency of only 0.454 would be expected, based on the allele frequencies of 0.68 for rs7903146-A and 0.668 for rs4506565-T. Thus, rs7903146-A and rs4506565-T are “in-phase” alleles and proxy meta-analysis can combine the respective effect estimates and standard errors. Since in all 6 studies the effect estimates for rs7903146-A or rs4506565-T, respectively, are positive, joint meta-analysis becomes highly significant with a p-value of 1.5×10−22. Of course, rs7903146 also is indicated by conventional meta-analysis with a p-value of 3.3×10−19, but in this case only 4 GWAS studies can be used and the additional evidence coming from studies 5 and 6 is lost. We note that the proxy-SNPs that YAMAS uses may differ from study to study. In the example, the same proxy SNP was used for both study 5 and 6.

    "content": "Results\n\nThe critical role of C5aR1+ neutrophils in BC\n\nTo identify the specific subsets of neutrophils that play a role in BC, we first analyzed a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset (GSE114727) containing single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from primary BC samples. A list of differentially expressed genes was obtained within tumor-infiltrating neutrophils, compared to that extracted from matched normal tissues, blood, and lymph nodes (Table S1). We took a special interest in C5aR1, which is abundantly expressed by almost 77.2% of neutrophils in the BC environment (Fig. 1A and Table S1). To assess the potential role of C5aR1 on neutrophils in human BC, we determined C5aR1+ neutrophils (named C5RN) ratio within the total CD66b+ neutrophils in different tissues at various stages. Strikingly, patients with BC showed a higher C5RN percentage in peripheral blood than healthy donors (Fig. 1B). Within the patient cohort, tumors displayed a significantly higher C5RN percentage than normal tissues (Fig. 1C). Moreover, as the cancer progressed, we found that the percentage of C5RN significantly increased in each of the tested samples (Fig. 1C). To explore the clinical relevance of C5aR1+ neutrophils in BC, we generated a gene signature (CD66b, CD15, and C5aR1) to examine the abundance of C5RN in primary breast tumors. The correlation between C5RN gene signature and neutrophil activation marker CD54 was evaluated by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Intriguingly, C5RN gene signature and activation of neutrophils are correlated in human BC (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the high C5RN gene signature group had a worse overall survival and relapse-free survival than the low C5RN gene signature group, as shown in GSE20685 and GSE7390 (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that increased C5aR1+ neutrophils are associated with tumor progression and poor survival for BC patients.\n\nC5aR1+ neutrophils lead to enrichment of metabolites and genes associated with glycolysis in BC cells\n\nTo examine the influence of C5aR1+ neutrophils on BC cells, we co-cultured C5RN with two cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 (tumor cells: neutrophils, 10:1), by using a non-contacting transwell system (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The CD66b+C5aR1− neutrophils (named Ctr-N) were used as the control. During the experiments, we observed marked differences in the color of culture medium in C5RN-cultured cells relative to control group (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Generally, the phenol red in culture media gradually becomes yellow at lower pH values as a result of lactate generation. This finding leads us to assume whether C5RN play a role in modulating BC glucose metabolism. To this end, we performed metabolome profiling of C5RN-incubated MCF-7 cells (MCF-7C5RN). Principal component analysis suggested that the extractions were different between MCF-7C5RN and control group (MCF-7Ctr-N, Fig. 2A). We found that a number of key metabolites involved in glycolysis and TCA cycle were enhanced in MCF-7C5RN (Table S2). Specifically, MCF-7C5RN cells exhibited an accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose 6-bisphosphate, 1,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid, 3-phosphoglyceric acid, 2-phosphoglyceric acid, phosphoenolpyruvic acid, lactate, and acetyl coenzyme A (Fig. 2B). Notably, the G6P/ribose 5-phosphate ratio was also increased (Fig. 2B), suggesting an enhanced glucose metabolism without diversion into the pentose phosphate pathway. In addition, levels of TCA cycle intermediates (citrate, cis-aconitate, fumarate, and malate) were significantly improved (Fig. 2C). This showed an increase in energy production via TCA cycle in MCF-7C5RN cells. To further elucidate the effect of C5RN on BC cells, RNA-sequencing was conducted in the same cell lines. The mRNA profiling of MCF-7C5RN revealed a significant enrichment of genes closely associated with glycolysis, as compared to control cells (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that C5aR1 may be a cell surface marker distinguishing the neutrophils, which can induce BC glycolysis.\n\nENO1 knockout (KO) of BC cells reverses the glycolytic changes mediated by C5aR1+ neutrophils\n\nAmong the genes examined in the mRNA profiling, ENO1 was the most upregulated glycolysis-relevant gene in MCF-7C5RN cells. To test whether ENO1 was essential for C5RN-induced glycolysis, we implemented CRISPR-Cas9 to KO ENO1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The CRISPR control single guide RNA (sgRNA) was used as the control group (sgCtrl). After confirming the KO effect (Fig. 3A), we found that C5aR1+ neutrophil-cultured tumor cells (MCF-",

The CRISPR control single guide RNA (sgRNA) was used as the control group (sgCtrl). After confirming the KO effect (Fig. 3A), we found that C5aR1+ neutrophil-cultured tumor cells (MCF-7C5RN and MDA-MB-231C5RN) exhibited an increase of glucose uptake, lactate secretion, and ATP production than the control group (Fig. 3B–D). This effect was significantly decreased upon ENO1 KO (Fig. 3B–D). To better determine the involvement of ENO1 in glycolysis-shifted metabolism in BC, we performed live monitoring to measure extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Compared with the controls, C5RN incubation led to a significant increase in ECAR, a proxy for the rate of glycolysis and glycolytic capacity, while ENO1 KO abated this effect (Fig. 3E). In addition, ENO1 KO also alleviated the glycolytic capacity of tumor cells treated with control neutrophils (Fig. 3B–E). Meanwhile, we observed concomitant changes in the expression of key glycolytic genes like GLUT1 and LDHA (Fig. 3F and Supplementary Fig. 1C). Thus, these data indicate that ENO1 KO reverses the glycolysis mediated by C5aR1+ neutrophils in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.\n\nERK1/2-ENO1 signaling is responsible for C5aR1+ neutrophil-induced cancer glycolysis\n\nThe neutrophils in tumor microenvironment play a crucial role in carcinogenesis via the secretion of various cytokines/chemokines. Thus, we propose that ENO1 upregulation in BC cells is triggered by C5aR1+ neutrophil-secreted cytokines and/or chemokines. Using a PCR array, we screened the mRNA expression of cytokines/chemokines and observed that several cytokines/chemokines were highly expressed in C5RN compared to Ctr-N (Fig. 4A). Among them, IL1β and TNFα were top two candidates and abundantly secreted by C5RN, as suggested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (Fig. 4A). However, blockade of IL1R (IL1Ra) or TNFR (R-7050) only slightly decreased the expression level of ENO1 induced by C5RN (Fig. 4B). When suppressing both IL1R and TNFR, we observed a significant downregulation of ENO1 in the cells (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that TNFα and IL1β may cooperatively but not solely promote ENO1 expression in BC cells. Considering that both TNFα and IL1β play pro-inflammatory roles by activating the signaling pathways within cells, we thus seek to determine the pathways responsible for ENO1 upregulation. We used inhibitors to target the most commonly aberrantly activated pathways and found that inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling with SCH772984 suppressed ENO1 protein expression in BC cells in a 24-h period (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. 2A). Indeed, synergetic inhibition of TNFR and IL1R also suppressed the activation of ERK1/2 (Supplementary Fig. 2B). To further investigate the role of ERK1/2 in C5RN-induced glycolysis, we treated MCF-7C5RN and MDA-MB-231C5RN cells with SCH772984. The results showed that targeting ERK1/2 reduced glucose uptake (Fig. 4D), lactate production (Fig. 4E), and ECAR of MCF-7C5RN and MDA-MB-231C5RN (Fig. 4F), while ERK1/2 inhibition also suppressed the glycolysis of tumor cells treated with control neutrophils (Fig. 4D–F). Therefore, ERK1/2-ENO1 signaling is responsible for C5RN-induced glycolytic activity of BC cells.\n\nNext, we evaluated the clinical relevance of C5RN gene signature, TNFα, IL1β, and ENO1 in BC. In patients with a high C5RN gene signature expression, the expression of TNFα, IL1β, and ENO1 tends to be low and vice versa (Fig. 4G), suggesting an indeed clinically important regulation. The expression of IL1β and TNFα was also positively correlated with ENO1 in BC tissues (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we found that a high C5RN gene signature and ENO1 co-expression predicts worse prognosis of BC patients compared with a low co-expression (Fig. 4H).\n\nC5aR1+ neutrophil-induced ERK1/2 activation controls m6A modification to upregulate ENO1 expression\n\nWe then sought to determine whether C5aR1+ neutrophil-induced ERK1/2 signaling upregulated ENO1 expression on a transcriptional level. With chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, we observed that the abundance of chromatin activation mark H3K4me3 and the occupancy of DNA polymerase II at the promoter regions of ENO1 were not influenced by C5aR1+ neutrophil stimulation (Fig. 5A). Thus, we wondered whether or not",

With chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, we observed that the abundance of chromatin activation mark H3K4me3 and the occupancy of DNA polymerase II at the promoter regions of ENO1 were not influenced by C5aR1+ neutrophil stimulation (Fig. 5A). Thus, we wondered whether or not C5RN stimulation facilitated ENO1 expression via post-transcriptional regulation of RNA stability. m6A is the first established and most common internal modification of RNA that widely affects RNA stability. As such, we tested whether ENO1 upregulation in BC cells was mediated in an m6A-relevant manner. Interestingly, the global m6A level in MCF-7C5RN was boosted compared with that in the control cells, which was abolished by ERK1/2 inactivation (Fig. 5B). It is known that methyltransferase or demethylase mainly control the m6A level. To study whether C5RN stimulation induces m6A level via RNA methyltransferases or demethylases, the levels of METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, FTO, and ALKBH5 were examined in MCF-7C5RN. We found that C5RN cultivation promoted the expression of WTAP protein without affecting its mRNA levels, whereas inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling by SCH772984 reduced WTAP protein expression in cancer cells (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. 2D). Using cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay, we also demonstrated that inhibition of ERK1/2 triggered WTAP degradation (Fig. 5D). Strikingly, the expression of other proteins exhibited no significant change (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). These results indicate that ERK1/2 plays a vital role in WTAP protein stabilization in C5RN-cultured tumor cells.\n\nTo investigate whether WTAP controls m6A modification to promote ENO1 expression, we determined the existence of m6A modification on ENO1 by m6A RNA immunoprecipitation (m6A-RIP) sequencing. Through analyzing the m6A-RIP sequencing data, we detected several significant m6A peaks that were reduced by WTAP silencing in the 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) of ENO1 mRNA (Fig. 5E). Indeed, knockdown of WTAP decreased m6A-methylated ENO1 mRNAs in MCF-7C5RN and MDA-MB-231C5RN, which was consistent with the m6A-dependent function of WTAP (Fig. 5F). We then constructed luciferase reporters containing 3′UTR of ENO1 (pGL3-ENO1-WT) or control mutant (pGL3-ENO1-MUT). As expected, silencing WTAP reduced the luciferase activity of the pGL3-ENO1-WT vector, while mutation in the m6A sites abolished the inhibition (Fig. 5G). Additionally, knockdown of WTAP decreased the mRNA stability of ENO1 in MCF-7C5RN and MDA-MB-231C5RN cells (Fig. 5H and Supplementary Fig. 3C). Considering that WTAP is essential for the function of METTL3/METTL14 complex, we then inhibited METTL3 or METTL14 using small-interfering RNAs. The data revealed that silencing either METTL3 or METTL14 could also reduce the stability of ENO1 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 3D). To confirm the direct interaction between ENO1 mRNAs and WTAP protein, we further performed cross-linking and RNA immunoprecipitation (CLIP) quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. As shown in Fig. 5I, ENO1 mRNAs can interact with WTAP in both MCF-7C5RN and MDA-MB-231C5RN, suggesting that ENO1 are direct targets of WTAP. Moreover, WTAP silencing reduced mRNA levels of ENO1 in C5RN-cultured tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. 3E). Thus, C5aR1+ neutrophils activate ERK1/2-WTAP signaling to sustain ENO1 expression in BC cells.\n\nWTAP phosphorylation at S341 by ERK1/2 stabilizes WTAP to promote BC cell glycolysis\n\nTo investigate how ERK1/2 signaling maintains WTAP expression, we performed reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays in BC cells. Interestingly, WTAP was able to associate with active ERK1/2 in MCF-7C5RN, which was further alleviated by ERK1/2 suppression (Fig. 6A). Moreover, we conducted in vitro kinase assays using recombinant ERK2 and purified WTAP. It was shown that WTAP was phosphorylated by ERK2, whereas the inhibitor SCH772984 abrogated phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 4A). We then determined whether ERK1/2 phosphorylated WTAP since the ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 inhibited WTAP expression. According to GPS 5.0 (http://gps.biocuckoo.cn/), several serine and threonine sites in WTAP may be phosphorylated by ERK1/2 (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Among these sites, S306 and S341 phosphorylations have been documented in a previous research. However, only S341 of WTAP is",

According to GPS 5.0 (http://gps.biocuckoo.cn/), several serine and threonine sites in WTAP may be phosphorylated by ERK1/2 (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Among these sites, S306 and S341 phosphorylations have been documented in a previous research. However, only S341 of WTAP is conserved across different mammalian species (Supplementary Fig. 4C), suggesting that it is most likely the ERK phosphorylation site. To examine this hypothesis, we constructed S341A mutant of WTAP and observed that S341A mutation largely abrogated the association of ERK1/2 with WTAP (Fig. 6B). Using the phosphoserine antibodies, we confirmed that S341 of WTAP2 was phosphorylated in MCF-7C5RN cells (Fig. 6B). Notably, the S341A mutant displayed a clear signal with p-Serine antibody, suggesting that another residue of WTAP might also be phosphorylated by ERK1/2. Additionally, C5RN stimulation increased serine phosphorylation of WTAP in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, while ERK1/2 suppression decreased the phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). On the other hand, inhibition of the ERK1/2 downstream kinase MNK1 by CGP57380 failed to affect WTAP phosphorylation at S341 site (Fig. 6B), suggesting WTAP as a direct target of ERK1/2.\n\nTo determine the function of the WTAP phosphorylation, we first measured the stability of exogenous FLAG-tagged WTAP. S341A mutant displayed an accelerated degradation compared with the wild type (Fig. 6D). In addition, the m6A level is markedly lower in S341A mutant relative to the wild-type WTAP (Supplementary Fig. 4D). Next, S341A mutant was expressed to a similar amount as wild-type WTAP (judged by the similar protein levels, Supplementary Fig. 4E) and its glycolytic effect was tested. Intriguingly, S341A mutant exerted minimal effects on the promotion of lactate production (Fig. 6E) and ECAR (Fig. 6F) of BC cells compared with wild-type WTAP. To further study whether WTAP stabilized by C5RN can affect BC growth in vivo, we injected the cells transfected with shWTAP or shNC, with or without C5RN (10:1), into nude mice. It was observed that C5RN significantly contributed to the growth of breast tumors, while WTAP inhibition largely attenuated this effect (Fig. 6G).\n\nCollectively, the schematic diagram of this study is shown in Fig. 7.",

    "content": "Results\n\nOverall, 7,647 whites and 2,104 blacks from ARIC and 1,304 whites and 608 blacks from CARDIA were included in this study (Supplementary Table 1). Mean age in ARIC (56–57 years) was higher than in CARDIA (45–46 years). The cohorts had similar distribution of sex. CARDIA had a greater percentage of black participants and lower mean values for each measure of glycemia as compared with ARIC.\n\nWe identified four genome-wide significant loci in ARIC, two associated with fructosamine and two with percent glycated albumin. Three of these variants, rs34459162 intronic to RCN3, rs2438321 (intergenic), and rs59443763 intronic to PRKCA have not previously been reported to be associated with any glycemic traits in humans (Table 1). None of the analyses showed evidence for inflation (Supplementary Figs. 2–7).\n\nAmong whites, rs34459162 (MAF = 0.08), a missense SNP in RCN3 on chromosome 19, was significantly associated with 1.8% lower fructosamine per minor allele (P = 5.3 × 10−9, variance explained = 0.6%) (Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2). This SNP was also associated with total glycated albumin (P = 3.8 × 10−8) (Table 2). The association with percent glycated albumin approached genome-wide significance (P = 7.3 × 10−8), but this SNP was not associated with fasting glucose or HbA1c (Table 2). A proxy for rs34459162 (rs8105626, in r2 = 1 rs34459162) was not associated in CARDIA for association with fructosamine (P = 0.09), although the effect sizes were identical and meta-analysis across the cohorts was significant (P = 4.9 × 10−9) (Table 1). Conditional analysis in ARIC showed that the additional 63 significant SNPs in the region became nonsignificant after conditioning on rs34459162. In blacks, rs34459162 did not meet the info score >0.8 threshold and thus was not analyzed (Table 2).\n\nAmong whites, rs1260326 (also known as rs343480), a known missense mutation in GCKR on chromosome 2 (MAF = 0.41), was significantly associated with 1.1% lower levels of percent glycated albumin per minor allele (P = 5.3 × 10−9, variance explained = 0.3%) (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9) (Table 1). The association with percent glycated albumin was also significant in CARDIA (P = 0.04), with similar percent difference (0.8% lower per minor allele) and genome-wide significant meta-analysis results (2.3 × 10−8) (Table 1). The conditional analysis did not reveal additional independent signals in this region. This SNP was not associated with any biomarker among blacks (MAF = 0.14) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2), but power was limited, and the meta-analysis across ancestries was not significant (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 10).\n\nAmong blacks, rs2438321 on chromosome 11 (MAF = 0.11) was associated with 3.5% higher levels of fructosamine per minor allele at a genome-wide significant level (P = 6.2 × 10−9, variance explained = 1.8%) (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12) and approached significance with percent glycated albumin (P = 6.4 × 10−5) and total glycated albumin (P = 2.0 × 10−6) (Table 2). rs2438321 was not associated with HbA1c in blacks and was not associated with any of the markers of hyperglycemia in whites independently or in a meta-analysis across ancestries (Tables 1 and 2). This SNP was not available in the CARDIA data set; however, a proxy SNP in perfect LD (r 2 = 1, rs35256014, MAF = 0.06) was present but did not replicate the association with fructosamine in blacks (P = 0.57), and meta-analysis results were also nonsignificant (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 13).\n\nAn intronic variant, rs59443763, in PRKCA on chromosome 17 (MAF = 0.06), was significantly associated with 5.4% higher percent glycated albumin per minor allele in blacks (P = 4.9 × 10−9, variance explained = 2%) (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15). It was also associated with fructosamine (P = 9.4 × 10−7) and total glycated albumin (P = 5.8 × 10−7), although these associations did not meet genome-wide significance (Table 2). This SNP was not significant among whites or in trans-ancestry meta-analysis (Tables 1 and 2), but there was limited power to replicate (Supplementary Table 2). No proxy SNPs with r2 > 0.7 were available in the CARDIA data set, and thus replication was not possible for this association.\n\nSensitivity Analyses\n\nIn analyses that excluded participants with undiagnosed diabetes, genome-wide significant results remained for the white sample (N = 7,229",

Correlations between fasting glucose and HbA1c with the other biomarkers were moderate to substantial but were not significant.\n\nCandidate SNP Analysis\n\nWe investigated SNPs previously identified in fasting glucose and HbA1c GWAS for association with fructosamine and percent glycated albumin. Nineteen of the 41 fasting glucose SNPs were nominally (P < 0.05) associated with fasting glucose, and 13 of these associations were in the same direction in blacks and whites (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 6) and 33 had consistent direction with the discovery cohort in whites. Four variants (10%) were study-wide significantly associated with fructosamine and percent glycated albumin in whites, three of which were associated with percent glycated albumin and one of which was associated with fructosamine. No variants were study-wide significantly associated with fructosamine or percent glycated albumin in blacks.\n\nThirty-one of 46 previously identified HbA1c SNPs were nominally associated with HbA1c, 15 of which were associated in the same direction in blacks and whites (Table 4 and Supplementary Table 7), and 43 had consistent direction with the discovery cohort in whites. Five SNPs (11%) demonstrated a study-wide significant association with fructosamine or glycated albumin in whites. All variants associated with multiple glycemic biomarkers had effects in the same direction.\n\nPercent Variance Explained\n\nSNPs associated with fasting glucose (N = 41) (Table 3) explained 1.4% of the variance in fructosamine, 3.2% of the variance in percent glycated albumin, and 1.9% of the variance in total glycated albumin among whites. Taking SNPs associated with serum albumin from the GWAS catalog explained 0.4% of the variance of fructosamine, 1.1% of the variance of percent glycated albumin, and 0.7% of the variance of total glycated albumin among the white sample.",

We considered as a mutation any rare variant (frequency <1%) found in the coding sequence. In this regard, T112M was thus considered as a mutation, whereas the more frequent V103I and I251L were excluded. Among the 2,257 obese subjects, we identified 36 different mutations (4 synonymous, 31 missense [6 new], and 1 frameshift) in 56 carriers (2.48%) (Tables 1 and 2; Fig. 1). Two adults were homozygous carriers for I301T, and one patient was a compound heterozygous carrier for Y80X and I301T. In the control group, we identified 20 carriers of 15 different mutations (0.75%; 5 synonymous and 10 [5 new] missense). The prevalence rates are given in Table 1. The enrichment of nonsynonymous mutations in the obese group compared with the control subjects is statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, 2.26 vs. 0.52%, P = 9.8 × 10−8), but there was no difference in the prevalence of synonymous mutations between the two groups (0.22 vs. 0.22%, P = 1).\n\nFunctional characterization.\n\nWe characterized all newly identified missense mutations by testing the ability of mutated receptors to generate cAMP in response to increasing concentrations of α-MSH. Results are reported in Fig. 1 and Table 2 (Emax and half-maximal effective concentration are given in supplementary Table 1, available in an online appendix at http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0153): S94N, F201L, P260Q, and R305S showed a partial cAMP response to α-MSH. D126Y and I289L showed a complete inability to signal to cAMP. We observed no effect on the cAMP response to increasing concentrations of α-MSH for H76R, D146N, G231V, Y332C, and Y332H. The other 30 mutations have been characterized previously in in vitro assays (references in Table 2). Of the 34 mutations observed in obese subjects, only 23 (68%) result in a loss of function in vitro. From this stage, we only analyzed carriers of loss-of-function MC4R mutations.\n\nPrevalence of loss-of-function MC4R mutations.\n\nWe calculated the prevalence of loss-of-function MC4R mutations in our European population. In obese children, the prevalence was doubled in case of family history of obesity compared with sporadic obesity (2.31 vs. 1.08%, respectively). But the difference was not significant, which showed the relative homogeneity of the cohorts and allowed the calculation of a general prevalence in children: altogether, 1.81% of obese children carried loss-of-function MC4R mutations. In adults, likewise, the prevalence was higher in probands of obese families compared with obese subjects in whom there was no family history of obesity (2.32 vs. 0.92%, P = 0.02). Moreover 1.96% of class III obese subjects harbored loss-of-function MC4R mutations compared with 0.65% in class I-II, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.08). The mean prevalence of loss-of-function MC4R mutations in adult obesity was then 1.61%. Altogether, the prevalence in obese children and adults was 1.72%, whereas 0.15% of nonobese individuals (mean age 44 years; mean BMI 22.8 compared with 22.6 kg/m2 in the whole control population; one man and three women) carried a loss-of-function mutation (11-fold increase; P = 6.9 × 10−10; Table 1).\n\nPenetrance and mode of inheritance.\n\nWe evaluated the penetrance of the loss-of-function MC4R mutations in two ways. First, we calculated the proportion of carriers of loss-of-function mutations with obesity in our entire population: 63.5% for heterozygous and 94.6% for homozygous/compound heterozygous carriers, respectively, according to the Bayes’ theorem. We also assessed the penetrance of loss-of-function MC4R mutations in 25 French multigenerational nonconsanguineous pedigrees where the proband was obese and carried a loss-of-function MC4R mutation (supplementary Fig. 1). The familial penetrance was 60% for heterozygous carriers. It was 100% in homozygous and compound heterozygous carriers.\n\nFor mutation I301T, we observed a codominant mode of inheritance: two homozygous unrelated individuals presented a BMI of 40.5 and 42.9 kg/m2 compared with a BMI of 31.78 kg/m2 for a I301T heterozygous carrier. Moreover, this heterozygous individual was the father of two compound heterozygous carriers of I301T plus Y80X with BMIs of 49.68 and 54.43 kg/m2, respectively (supplementary Fig. 1). The mother carrying mutation Y80X had a BMI of 33.05 kg/m2. The third generation of this family included two overweight children of 10 and 14 years (BMI 19.0 and 22.3 kg/m2, respectively; BMI ≥90th percentile) carrying either the I",

The third generation of this family included two overweight children of 10 and 14 years (BMI 19.0 and 22.3 kg/m2, respectively; BMI ≥90th percentile) carrying either the I301T or the Y80X mutations. The increase in the BMI in homozygous/compound heterozygous compared with heterozygous carriers was significant (P = 0.008).\n\nWe observed no impact of the severity of the mutations (Table 2, partial activity vs. no activity) on the severity of the phenotype of the carriers. Mean BMI for carriers of mutations leading to a receptor with a partial activity was 33.62 vs. 31.45 kg/m2 for carriers of one nonfunctional receptor (P = 0.413).\n\nEffects of age on obesity phenotype in MC4R deficiency.\n\nWe compared obesity-related phenotypes between carriers and their relatives for children (n = 19 vs. 13) and adults (n = 78 vs. 81). Within the 25 pedigrees, as expected, in each generation, the mean BMI was higher in mutation carriers compared with relatives with a normal MC4R genotype (supplementary Table 2). We observed a gender effect in the whole family sample (+4.3 kg/m2 in men and +8.7 kg/m2 in women; ref.) but the difference is not significant (P = 0.19). Children probands were not bigger than their siblings carrying loss-of-function mutations (26.2 vs. 22.6 kg/m2, P = 0.19), but the difference was significant in adults (45.02 vs. 31.93 kg/m2, P = 0.007).\n\nOnset of obesity and evolution of BMI with age.\n\nWe obtained heights and weights of children at different ages from the individual health record. Although there was a trend toward earlier development of obesity in MC4R mutation carriers compared with obese subjects with a normal MC4R genotype (3.2 vs. 6.0 years), this was not statistically significant (P = 0.11). The adiposity rebound (a strong predictor of the development of childhood obesity) occurred 3 years earlier in children with MC4R mutations (2.0 vs. 5.2 years; P = 0.006).\n\nIn adults, we calculated BMI at 20 years of age from self-reported heights and weights and compared this with measured BMI at the age at examination (mean 44 years). The mean reported BMI of loss-of-function MC4R mutation carriers at 20 years of age (BMI20) was 26.8 kg/m2. Probands were all obese at 20 years; among the carrier-relatives, 22 subjects were normal weight at this age (BMI <90th percentile, 43%), 10 were overweight (BMI ≥90th percentile <97th percentile, 20%), and 19 were obese (BMI ≥97th percentile, 37%). The BMI20 was slightly but significantly lower in relatives with a normal MC4R genotype (24.21 kg/m2, P = 0.04). The BMI of carriers of loss-of-function MC4R mutations increased significantly during this time frame compared with nonmutation carrier relatives (13.75 vs. 6.18 kg/m2, P = 1.66 × 10−5). Seven of the 22 (32%)carriers that were nonobese at 20 years showed late-onset obesity, and 8 of the 10 individuals (80%) who were overweight became obese.\n\nEffect of generation on BMI and obesity penetrance.\n\nComparing the carriers of loss-of-function mutations to their relatives with a normal MC4R genotype in the 25 pedigrees, we observed a significant BMI increase of 6.78 kg/m2 (26.37 vs. 33.15 kg/m2, P = 5.95 × 10−6).\n\nAdult carriers <52 years were 3 kg/m2 heavier at 20 years of age than the previous generation at the same age (data not shown). The disease penetrance was 78% in children, 60% in adults <52 years old, and 40% in adults >52 years old for obesity (supplementary Table 3). The decrease in penetrance was significant between children and adults >52 years old (P = 0.038). In noncarriers, the prevalence of obesity was the same in each generation (23%; supplementary Table 3).\n\nAlthough carrying a MC4R mutation was consistently associated with obesity in every generation, the risk of obesity in carriers was multiplied by 3.4 for children (P = 10−100, Fisher's exact test), by 2.9 for adults <52 years old (P = 10−84), and by only 1.7 for adults >52 years old (P = 10−11) compared with noncarrier individuals. This decrease in risk was significant between adults >52 and <52 years old (P = 3.0 × 10−5) and between children and adults >52 years old (P = 9.6 × 10−4; Fig. 2).\n\nWe looked at the genotype distribution of FTO rs1421085 among the generations and found no differences between carriers and noncarriers or among children, adults <52 years old, and adults >52 years old (data not shown).\n\nEating behavior.\n\nAn in-house questionnaire distributed to children assessed three abnormal food intake behaviors.",

There were twice as many children who ate large amounts of food during meals in the carrier group compared with their noncarrier relatives (61.1 vs. 37.5%; P = 0.25). No obese child was a binge eater, and snacking was equally frequent in the two groups.\n\nIn adults, we used the well-established TFEQ questionnaire and observed a significant increase of the disinhibition score in MC4R mutation carriers compared with noncarrier relatives (7.2 vs. 5.1, P = 0.007; supplementary Table 2). Moreover, the proportion of carriers harboring a disinhibition rating above the mean score was 37 vs. 12% in noncarrier relatives (P = 0.01). The same was true for the hunger score: 31.0% of carriers above the mean vs. 10% in noncarrier subjects (P = 0.047). Using these methods, eating behavior was not impaired in adult nonobese carriers compared with their noncarrier relatives, suggesting that the effects of MC4R on eating behavior may exhibit incomplete penetrance.\n\nWe observed a negative relationship between educational level and BMI in noncarrier adults (P = 0.045) within the families (n = 81), as previously reported, but no such correlation was observed for the 78 adult carriers of loss-of-function MC4R mutations (P = 0.42; data not shown). Apart from BMI and reported eating behavior, we observed no consistent difference for the other analyzed clinical traits between carriers and noncarriers (supplementary Table 2) in this study.\n\nExclusion of the probands.\n\nTo exclude any recruitment bias, we performed the analyses of the same phenotypes without the probands. Effects of the mutations on BMI remained significant (+5.17 kg/m2, P = 1.37 × 10−3); effects on the other clinical features seemed to remain as trends, but we were no longer able to observe the generational effect on penetrance (supplementary Table 4).",

    "content": "Results\n\nOf the total 13,426 participants in the Tehran Cardio-metabolic Genetic Study (TCGS), after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 766 individuals finally entered the cohort. By the end of the follow up, 206 (27%) were categorized as the persistent MHO and 560 (73%) as MUO groups.\n\nThe half of females and males were free from metabolic abnormalities at age 40 CI (38.2–41.8) and 46 CI (45.0–46.9), respectively (Fig. 2). As can be seen, the survival curves differed significantly from each other (log rank test, P < 0.001). The baseline characteristics of 766 individuals when entering the study (phase I or II) are shown in Table 1. The mean age in MHO and MUO groups were 30 and 35 years, respectively. A total of 169 subjects (82%) of the MHO and 378 (67.5%) of the MUO group were women which where statistically significant (P < 0.001). There were significant differences in all baseline characteristics between the two groups (P < 0.05), except for physical activity level, homeostatic model assessment of HOMA-IR and IR. Thus, these baseline variables were more favorable in the persistent MHO group compared to the MUO. At the end of the follow up, when evaluating the metabolic status of female subjects, 30 (17.8%) and 78 (20.6%) of the persistent MHO and MUO groups were in menopause respectively, which was not a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.06).\n\nTo determine the relationship between candidate genetic markers and persistence of MHO individuals, the logistic regression with dominant model was used. Comparing the two groups, when all participants including both men and women entered the model, none of the markers showed any association. Considering significant interaction effect between some SNP and sex (P for interaction < 0.001), a sex stratification analysis was applied. When the analysis was performed by gender, rs1121980 associated with a decrease, and rs7903146 with an increase in the likelihood of persistent MHO individuals. Furthermore, another analysis was separately performed on postmenopausal women from both groups (P for interaction < 0.001 for menopausal status); it showed that rs13107325 was significantly different between the two groups. It was associated with an increase in the likelihood of persistent MHO status in this subgroup of woman. In all cases, the markers had dominant inheritance, suggesting that having an allele of the intended genes can increase or decrease the likelihood of persistence of MHO status. Information on the effective genetic biomarkers in the cohort study is summarized in Tables 2 and 3.\n\nIn addition, a cross-sectional statistical analysis at the end of the study was performed based on the metabolic status of participants in phase V of the TCGS (1,772 and 5,455 in the MHO and MUO groups, respectively), which demonstrated no significant association between the candidate genetic markers and metabolic status of participants.",

Six of the nine variants were statistically associated with BMI, with one additional SNP approaching statistical significance. The SNP most strongly associated with BMI localized to the FTO gene (rs1121980) (P < 0.0001). The MC4R rs17782313 SNP statistically interacted with sex (P = 0.02), whereby the minor allele was associated with higher BMI in women (β = 0.41 kg/m2 per copy of the minor allele; P = 0.0034), but no effect was observed in men (β = − 0.03 kg/m2 per copy of the minor allele; P = 0.83). Similar interaction effects were observed for total (P = 0.024) and abdominal (P = 0.046) adipose mass.\n\nThe FTO SNP (rs1121980) was also strongly associated with total, abdominal and gynoid adipose mass (Table 3). As in earlier studies, the per allele increase in weight for FTO rs1121980 was 1.03 kg (P = 0.005), of which 0.91 kg was attributable to increased total adipose mass (P = 0.0007). As shown in Table 3, although trends for association with measures of adiposity were evident for several of the remaining SNPs in directions consistent with the associations with obesity, only three reached a formal level of statistical significance (FTO, MTCH2 and GNPDA2). Figure 1 shows the absolute weight difference between major and minor allele homozygotes at each of the obesity-associated loci and between the first and fifth quintiles of the genetic burden score (GBS). The figure also illustrates how much of the total weight difference between genotypes at a given locus is attributable to adipose accumulation. When the overall contribution of these SNPs was assessed using the GBS, strong associations were evident for all anthropometric (Fig. 2A and B) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measures of obesity (Fig. 2C–E). For example, when stratified into quintiles, those with the highest level of the GBS (Q5) weighed approximately 2.56 kg more than those with the lowest level of the GBS (Q1) (β = 0.87 kg per SD increase in score, P < 0.0001). Consistently, BMI was 0.97 kg/m2 higher (β = 0.32 kg/m2 per SD increase in the score, P < 0.0001), total adipose mass was 2.41 kg higher (β = 0.76 kg per SD increase in the score, P = 0.0001), abdominal adipose mass was 0.14 kg higher (β = 0.04 kg per SD increase in the score, P = 0.0004), and gynoid adipose mass was 0.19 kg higher (β = 0.06 kg per SD increase in the score, P = 0.0002) in the top versus bottom quintiles of the GBS.\n\nGenotype associations with obesity (categorical trait models)\n\nThe following results are derived from the cohort of non-diabetic individuals only (n = 3885). Table 4 shows obesity risk estimates (odds ratios; OR) for each of the genetic predictor variables ranked by magnitude of effect in non-diabetics. As with the BMI models reported above, the FTO rs1121980 variant was the most strongly associated SNP, with a per allele OR of 1.15 (95% CI 1.05–1.25; P = 0.0016). Five of the remaining SNPs (SH2B1, MTCH2, MC4R, NEGR1 and GNPDA2) were significantly associated with obesity in directions consistent with prior reports of association with BMI. For the GBS, the risk of obesity increased by 1.13 (95% CI 1.06–1.21; P = 0.0002) per SD unit increase, with a 1.40-fold (95% CI 1.14–1.72; P = 0.002) increased risk of being obese for those in the top compared with the bottom quintiles of the score. One SNP (MC4R rs17782313) statistically interacted with sex (P = 0.02), whereby the minor allele was associated with increased obesity risk in women (OR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.06–1.36; P = 0.0034), but no effect was observed in men (OR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.79–1.12; P = 0.48).\n\nComparison of genetic effects on obesity receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROCAUC models)\n\nThe power of each of the SNPs to discriminate between normal weight and obese individuals [i.e. the receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROCAUC)] was compared against the discriminative power of the GBS as the criterion variable (Table 4). The crude ROCAUC for the GBS was 0.5752 (Fig. 3) (P < 0.0001). This compared with a ROCAUC of 0.5881 (P < 0.0001) when all eight SNPs were entered simultaneously into the ROC model.

The combination of all SNPs was a significantly more powerful discriminator than any single SNP, with or without adjustment for age and sex (P < 0.05). The FTO variant was the most discriminative of the individual SNPs (crude ROCAUC = 0.5435; P < 0.0001), with the crude ROCAUCs ranging from 0.5087 to 0.5348 for the remaining SNPs.\n\nGenetic effects on risk of type 2 diabetes\n\nTable 5 shows the associations between each of the nine obesity-risk variants and type 2 diabetes. In models adjusted for age and sex, four variants were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes risk (FTO rs1121980: P = 0.013; MC4R rs17782313: P = 0.009; GNPDA2 rs10938397: P = 0.028; TMEM18 rs6548238: P = 0.007). A tendency for association with diabetes was observed for the SH2B1 rs7498665 variant (P = 0.06). After additional adjustment for BMI, none remained statistically significant. Although PCSK1 rs6235 was not significantly associated with diabetes in the age- and sex-adjusted models (P = 0.21), additional adjustment for BMI rendered a nominally significant protective effect for this variant (P = 0.04).\n\nThe risk of type 2 diabetes was significantly increased across the spectrum of the GBS following adjustment for age and sex (linear P < 0.0001). For each SD unit increase in the score, the risk of diabetes increased significantly (OR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.09–1.27), with those in the highest quintile of the GBS (n = 193/594 cases/controls) being at 1.55 (95% CI 1.21–1.99) greater risk of type 2 diabetes than those in the lowest quintile (n = 130/655 cases/controls). When all SNPs were simultaneously entered into the model, the unadjusted ROCAUC for type 2 diabetes was 0.5643 (P < 0.0001), which was significantly larger than any of the individual SNP ROCAUCs. The ROCAUC for the GBS was 0.5524, which did not differ from the model containing all SNPs (P difference = 0.14). Additional adjustment for BMI attenuated the association, with those in the highest quintile of the score no longer being at significantly greater risk of diabetes relative to those in the lowest quintile (OR 1.22; 95% CI 0.92–1.62). The ROCAUC for the model including age and sex (ROCAUCs = 0.6382) improved significantly when the nine SNPs were added to the model (ROCAUCs = 0.6654) (P < 0.0001). However, BMI explained all the predictive power attributable to the SNPs (ROCAUCs: age, sex and BMI = 0.8236 versus age, sex, BMI and SNPs = 0.8236).",

A significant difference was observed only for race (p < 0.0001) due to different frequencies of the TCF7L2 risk allele in different ethnicities (see Table 3), so race was included into the ANCOVA model. The observed slight differences for baseline weight (p = 0.0443) and BMI (p = 0.0518) had no influence on the results when including them additionally into the ANCOVA model. \n\nDistribution of allelic and genotype frequencies\n\nThe allelic and genotype frequencies of the various TCF7L2 polymorphisms were determined for the cohort of consenting patients and the data categorised by race. The data for SNP rs7903146, which has the strongest association with type 2 diabetes, are shown in Table 3. The minor allelic frequency for the T allele was highest among white patients (34.3%) and lowest among Asian patients (18.5%), with black patients falling in the middle (20.0%). Homozygous TT occurred in 12.1% of white and 6.0% of Asian patients, but was absent in the black patients (Table 3), possibly owing to the low number of black patients participating in these studies. The observed frequencies in the white and Asian patients are concordant with publicly available allele and genotype frequencies. Results for the other polymorphisms and haplotypes were similar to those for rs7903146 (data not shown).\n\nComparison of clinical response between genotyped subgroup and all patients\n\nTo determine whether the subgroup for which genomic analysis was performed was representative of the population of patients who participated in all four trials, the clinical response observed for the subgroup was compared with that of the whole patient population (Fig. 2). The clinical responses to treatment with linagliptin or placebo in the subgroups for which pharmacogenomic data were available were essentially identical to those of the corresponding treatment groups in the whole cohort of patients from the four clinical trials—reduction in HbA1c was similar in the two groups treated with linagliptin and HbA1c did not change from baseline in the two groups receiving placebo. These results suggest that the pharmacogenomic subgroups were representative of the entire pooled patient population. \n\nSubgroup analyses\n\nTo address possible differences between the trials, we analysed each trial separately as well as in a pooled analysis again, incorporating additionally the study-by-treatment–genotype group interaction effect in the ANCOVA model. No significant heterogeneity of effects across the trials was observed. Detailed information and results of ANCOVA for each specific trial in comparison to the whole study population are given in electronic supplementary material (ESM) Table 1.\n\nAssociation of genotype with clinical response\n\nBased on TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotype, patients receiving linagliptin therapy were categorised into three groups: CC (homozygous non-risk allele carrier), CT (heterozygous) and TT (homozygous risk allele carrier). The strongest, almost identical, response to linagliptin therapy (i.e. lowering of HbA1c) was observed in patients with homozygous CC (n = 356; p < 0.0001) and heterozygous CT (n = 264; p < 0.0001) genotypes with a decrease of 0.82% (9.0 mmol/mol) and 0.77% (8.4 mmol/mol) in HbA1c, respectively, compared with baseline (Fig. 3). A less robust, but still statistically (p = 0.0006) and clinically significant, decrease of 0.57% (6.2 mmol/mol) in HbA1c in response to linagliptin therapy after 24 weeks was observed in patients who were homozygous TT (n = 73). The difference in response to linagliptin therapy between homozygous TT patients and homozygous CC patients was statistically significant (p = 0.0182). \n\nThe comparison of the number of patients in LOCF analyses vs the number of patients with observed 24 week data indicate that we have >80% observed cases in the linagliptin-treated group and >70% in the placebo group. The results, based only on observed cases, showed a significant difference of ~0.23% (p = 0.0392) between linagliptin-treated homozygous TT and non-risk-carrier CC patients and this is in concordance with the results obtained in the analyses for the LOCF set.\n\nAssociation of genotype with PPG levels\n\nPatients receiving placebo showed an increase from baseline in 2 h PPG levels with a mean rise of 2.13 mmol/l (ESM Fig. 1), which is likely related to the washout of previous glucose-lowering agents in the two clinical studies NCT00601250 and NCT00621140. This was in accordance with an increase in HbA1c levels in the placebo group in those two studies. Similar to the observed HbA1c levels after treatment, all patients treated with linagliptin showed a decrease from baseline in 2 h PPG levels after 24 weeks. Patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (CC) showed the greatest decrease from baseline in 2 h PPG levels, with a mean decrease of 2.78 mmol/l.

Based on quality control checks, 18 families (2% of families) were excluded for being inconsistent with Mendelian inheritance at more than two genotypes. Additionally, 47 subjects were excluded for failure at more than 11 genotypes (>50%), leaving a total of 737 case-parent triads (97% of the original sample). Of those, 317 were complete triads, 313 were dyads, and 107 were monads with only one person in the family. After these quality control measures were applied, at least 95% of the samples for each variant were available; therefore the genotypes were considered of sufficiently high quality for analysis.\n\nThe distributions of key characteristics among NTD case-parent triads are presented in Table 2. Spina bifida was the most common phenotype among case subjects (n=449, 60.9%). Furthermore, a majority of case mothers were non-Hispanic White (n=439, 59.8%). Among case mothers, 176 were obese (25.4%), 13 had pre-pregnancy diabetes (1.8%), and 28 had gestational diabetes (4.2%). The only characteristics presented in Table 2 that were significantly different between interviewed case mothers who provided buccal brushes and those who did not were race/ethnicity (those who provided buccal brushes were more likely to be non-Hispanic White compared to those who did not) and education (those who provided buccal brushes were more likely to have >12 years education compared to those who did not), data not shown.\n\nOf the 76 interactions evaluated, five had q<0.05 (Table 3). Among these five, four were confirmed using log-linear models among case-parent triads (step 2). Our results were similar when restricted to non-Hispanic white mating combinations (data not shown). Specifically, the following interactions were confirmed: maternal ENPP1 rs1044498-fetal SLC2A2 rs6785233 (interaction OR=3.65, 95% CI: 2.32–5.74, q=0.001, LRT p=0.00004); maternal LEP rs12706831-fetal SLC2A2 rs6785233 (interaction OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.29–0.71, q=0.016, LRT p=0.00001); maternal ENPP1 rs1044498-fetal SLC2A2 rs5400 (interaction OR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.34–2.92, q=0.016, LRT p=0.001); and maternal LEP rs2071045-fetal SLC2A2 rs5400 (interaction OR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.32–0.77, q=0.03, LRT p=0.008). As in our previous assessment, our results were similar when our analyses were restricted to 1) those case-parent triads with spina bifida only; 2) those case-parent triads where mothers did not have pre-gestational diabetes; and 3) those case-parent triads where mothers were not obese (Table 4 for results among non-obese mothers).",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nOut of 3002 screened publications (Figure 1), 1075 and 107 publications were assessed during abstract and full text screening. Inter‐rater agreement was κ = 0.72 and κ = 0.76 for title and abstract screening, respectively. Overall, 66 eligible publications were identified including 35 publication from cohort studies and 31 from RCTs. Among the publications from cohort studies, 28 investigated G × D, six G × PA, and one combined G × D and G × PA interactions. Among the publications from RCTs, 26 investigated G × L, two G × PA, one combined G × PA and G × D, one combined G × PA and G × L interactions, and one G × D interactions.\n\n Characteristics of the cohort studies \n\nEight publications from cohort studies (Table 1) were published from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) or the Health Professionals Follow‐Up Study (HPFS), six from the Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDCS), five from European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)‐InterAct, three from the Shanghai Diabetes GWAS study, two each from EPIC‐Potsdam, the Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) and the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KOGES), and one each from several other cohort studies. In NHS and HPFS, the study sample was recruited from the health sector staff and included mainly European descendants. In DESIR, volunteers from health facilities were recruited and in all other studies participants from the general population. The sample size of the studies varied between 718 and 99 166, with a mean age of participants greater than 40 years in most studies. The follow‐up time ranged from four to 26 years, with more than 8 years in most studies. Many studies were conducted in populations of only or mainly European ethnicity. Asians were included in the Shanghai Diabetes study, KOGES, and the Korea Association Resource (KARE). \n\nCharacteristics of the RCTs\n\nFifteen publications of RCTs were published from the Finish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS), 14 from the American Diabetes Prevention Project (DPP), one from Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED), and one from a study in Italians from Asti. \n\nIn DPP (Table 2), 3234 participants with IGT and elevated fasting glucose were randomized into an intensive lifestyle‐intervention group and two standard lifestyle groups with administer of metformin or placebo. The lifestyle intervention included individual advices and behavior modification to reduce weight by lower fat and calorie intake and higher PA. In DPS, 522 participants with a high risk for T2D were randomized into a lifestyle‐intervention group or a usual care control group. The lifestyle‐intervention group was individually guided to reduce weight by increasing PA and following a recommended diet. In DPP and DPS, the lifestyle intervention resulted in weight reduction and lower T2D risk. \n\nIn PREDIMED, participants with high cardiovascular risk were randomized into three groups: two Mediterranean‐diet groups with extra‐virgin olive oil (1 L/week) or mixed nuts (30 g/day), and a control group with advice on a low‐fat diet. In the Italian study, 335 participants who were nondiabetic and dysmetabolic were randomized into a lifestyle group which received individualized recommendations by trained professionals to reduce metabolic abnormalities and a control group which received standard, unstructured information.\n\nDietary and PA exposure assessments\n\nThe investigated dietary exposure varied considerably across the publications (Figure 2, Table S6) and included individual food groups (whole grain, red meat, olive oil, dairy, and coffee), macronutrients (fiber, carbohydrate, fat, and protein), micronutrients (magnesium, iron, zinc, and vitamin A), alcohol, glycemic index and glycemic load, and dietary patterns. Dietary factors were assessed in most studies by validated food frequency questionnaire and in some by dietary history records or biomarker measurements. PA (Table S7) was assessed either by in‐person interviews or questionnaires. \n\nStudy quality and risk of bias\n\nThe NOS quality assessment resulted in high and average quality for 30 and five publications of cohort studies (Table S2), respectively. Reasons for point's deduction were mostly inclusion of selective group of volunteers and health stuffs and no statement for completeness of follow‐up.\n\nThe Cochrane risk of bias assessment resulted in low risk of bias for all RCT (Figures S1 and S2). With exception of the performance bias, all judged categories showed low risk of bias. Risk of performance bias was high in all RCT due to the nature of the lifestyle intervention complicating blinding of patient and personal.\n\nThe evaluation of methodological quality (Table S3) resulted in high quality for 26 and medium quality for nine cohort study publications. For the RCTs, 13, 17, and one publications were scored as high, medium, and low quality, respectively. Small sample sizes and missing information about Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium often reduced methodological quality.\n\nMain findings\n\nOf the 66 eligible publications, 19 cohort studies and nine RCT publications reported statistically significant G × E interaction (Figure 2, Tables 3, 4). In addition, some other publications observed significant T2D risk associations in some exposure strata but not in the respective other, although no statistically significant interactions were reported. Potential G × D interaction for genetic variants in the TCF7L2 gene were most frequently investigated, while findings of other genetic variants were often limited to one publication only. Furthermore, publications showed a considerable heterogeneity in investigated dietary factors.\n\nFindings for G × D interaction on incident T2D\n\nInteraction of fiber and whole grain with genetic variants\n\nG × D interactions (Figure",

Potential G × D interaction for genetic variants in the TCF7L2 gene were most frequently investigated, while findings of other genetic variants were often limited to one publication only. Furthermore, publications showed a considerable heterogeneity in investigated dietary factors.\n\nFindings for G × D interaction on incident T2D\n\nInteraction of fiber and whole grain with genetic variants\n\nG × D interactions (Figure 2, Table S6) of TCF7L2 variants have been the most widely studied so far. In particular, the TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 is of interest as it is considered to be strongly associated with T2D risk and known to modify the effect of incretins on insulin secretion. Some publications reported interaction of TCF7L2 variants with fiber and whole‐grain intake on T2D incidence (Figure 2, Table S6). Increased cereal fiber intake in the Stockholm Diabetes Prevention Program (SDPP) and fiber intake in MDCS were associated with lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs7903146 CC‐genotype. Contrary, persons with the rs7903146 risk T‐allele showed a slight trend for increased T2D risk with increasing cereal fiber intake in SDPP and with increasing fiber intake in MDCS. An interaction of whole grain with TCF7L2 rs7903146 was also reported by SDPP and EPIC‐Potsdam. In line with the fiber findings, higher whole‐grain intake was in both studies associated with lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs7903146 CC‐genotype, but not among persons with the risk T‐allele. The TCF7L2 variant rs4506565 also showed interaction with cereal fiber and whole‐grain intake in SDPP and the TCF7L2 variant rs12255372 with fiber intake in MDCS. Contrary, in EPIC‐InterAct and NHS, no interactions of fiber intake with rs7903146 or rs12255372 were observed. \n\nIn MDCS, fiber intake also showed interactions with the variant rs10923931 in the NOTCH2 (involved in WNT activity) and rs4457053 in the ZBED3 (involved in WNT signaling pathway) gene but without replication in another study. Several further variants were investigated in MDCS and in EPIC‐InterAct but none showed an interaction with fiber (Figure 2).\n\nInteraction of carbohydrates and fat with genetic variants\n\nInteraction of carbohydrates and total fat was reported (Figure 2, Table S6) by MDCS with IRS1 rs2943641 (known to increase insulin sensitivity) and with GIPR rs10423928 (known to decrease insulin secretion). However, the IRS1 rs2943641 findings have not been validated in any other study so far, and the GIPR rs10423928 interaction findings could not be replicated in EPIC‐InterAct (12). In NHS, TCF7L2 rs12255372 showed no interaction with carbohydrates, but with glycemic load. A replication of this finding in EPIC‐InterAct failed as well. \n\nPotential interaction of fat with genetic variants was also reported by DESIR but without external replication. In DESIR, a trend for interaction (P = .05) was observed between fat intake and the PPARγ (receptor for fatty acid storage) variants rs1801282 and rs3856806. Furthermore, H‐allele carriers of the FFAR4 variant rs116454156 (involved in Gαq signaling) had a fourfold higher T2D incidence in DESIR than RR‐allele carriers but with low fat intake only. In EPIC‐Potsdam, the CAV2 variant rs2270188 showed an interaction with total fat and saturated fatty acids but a replicate of the CAV2 findings in EPIC‐InterAct failed (12). In addition, no evidence was found in EPIC‐InterAct, NHS, and HPFS for interactions of T2D‐GRSs and IR‐GRS with fat and carbohydrates.\n\nInteraction of alcohol with genetic variants\n\nAn interaction of alcohol with the ADH1C *1/*2 variant (Figure 2, Table S6) was reported by NHS. The ADH1C*2‐allele, which is related to a slower rate of ethanol oxidation, attenuated the lower diabetes risk among alcohol drinking US women. In contrast, such an interaction was not observed among US men. In addition, a T2D gene risk score (GRS) in NHS and HPFS and two HECTD4 variants in KoGES showed no interaction with alcohol.\n\nInteractions of micronutrients with genetic variants\n\nFindings (Figure 2, Table S6) indicate that the association of heme iron with T2D incidence is modified by a GRS of nine T2D associated loci and genetic variants of HFE (homeostatic iron regulator), SLC40A1 (iron‐regulated transporter), and TMPRSS6 gene (transmembrane serine proteinase). In HPFS, US men with high heme iron intake and high adherence to a T2D‐GRS had a higher T2D risk compared with other exposure strata. In NHS, higher heme iron intake was associated with increased T2D risk among women with the haemochromatosis‐associated HFE variants rs1799945 (H63D) or rs1800562 (C282Y). A similar trend was also observed in EPIC‐InterAct for women with the HFE rs1799945 variant, but the corresponding interaction was not significant. Contrary, for men in EPIC‐InterAct, this interaction was significant. In EPIC‐Inter",

A similar trend was also observed in EPIC‐InterAct for women with the HFE rs1799945 variant, but the corresponding interaction was not significant. Contrary, for men in EPIC‐InterAct, this interaction was significant. In EPIC‐InterAct, heme iron intake showed also interaction with the SLC40A1 rs744653 variant in men and with borderline significance (P = .046) for the TMPRSS6 variant rs855791 in the total sample. In NHS and HPFS, rs855791 showed no interaction. \n\nFor zinc intake, DPP reported an interaction with the SLC30A8 (zinc transporter) variants rs16889462, 8_118252314, and 8_118252435, but without a clear trend for an association with T2D incidence in exposure strata. Investigations of potential interaction of some genetic variants with magnesium intake or vitamin A resulted in nonsignificant findings (Figure 2).\n\nInteractions of individual food with genetic variants\n\nSeveral individual foods have been investigated for potential G × D interaction including red meat, processed meat, olive oil, dairy, and coffee (Figure 2, Table S6). Interactions of red and processed meat with a T2D‐GRS were observed in HPFS. High intake of red and processed meat increased the risk to develop T2D among men with a high GRS, but not among men with a low GRS. Olive oil showed a marginally nonsignificant interaction (P = .05) with the GIPR variant rs10423928 in EPIC‐InterAct.24 \n\nThe association of dairy products with T2D incidence may be modified by the genetic variant rs4988235 near the lactase persistence LCT gene. In a large Danish study, carriers with the lactase persistence LCT rs4988235 T‐allele had higher T2D risk compared with persons with the lactose nonpersistence CC‐genotype when they did not consume milk. A contrasting reduced risk was observed among milk consumers. Coffee intake is hypothesized to reduce T2D risk, and findings from EPIC‐InterAct and KARE indicate that there exist interactions of coffee with some genetic variants. In EPIC‐InterAct, a stronger T2D risk lowering effect with higher coffee intake has been observed for persons with the risk T‐allele of the TCF7L2 variant rs12255372. In KARE, only coffee consumers with the rs4402960 T‐allele (IGF2BP2), rs7754840 G‐allele (CDKAL1), and rs5215 CC‐genotype (KCNJ11) had a reduced combined prediabetes and T2D risk compared with nonconsumer. Besides these findings, several other genetic variants showed no interaction with coffee, olive oil, or dairy products (Figure 2).\n\nInteractions of dietary patterns with genetic variants\n\nEvidence suggests that dietary patterns that reflect Western diet and enhance T2D incidence and those that reflect Mediterranean diet lower T2D incidence. In HPFS (Figure 2, Table S6), a Western dietary pattern was associated to higher T2D risk only among persons with a high T2D‐GRS, but not among persons with a low T2D‐GRS. In PREDIMED, a borderline significant interaction (P = .052) between the CLOCK variant rs4580704 and the Mediterranean diet was observed indicating lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs4580704 G‐allele compared with persons with the CC‐genotype. In EPIC‐InterAct, a Mediterranean‐diet score showed no interaction with a T2D‐GRS. \n\nFindings for G × PA interactions on T2D incidence\n\nSeveral findings indicate that the protective effect of PA on T2D risk is modified by genetic variants (Tables 3 and S7). From the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, it was reported that the association of PA with lower T2D incidence was weaker among persons with high adherence to a T2D‐GRS compared with persons with a low adherence to the T2D‐GRS. In the Swedish Malmö preventive program, the minor HNF1B rs4430796 A‐allele weakened and possibly reversed the protective effect of higher PA on T2D incidence which was observed in persons with the GG‐genotype. In NHS, women with the IRS1 rs1522813 A‐allele and low levels of PA had a higher risk to develop T2D compared with women with the GG‐genotype, but not if they were physically active. \n\nIn DPS, reduced leisure‐time physical activity (LTPA) (Table 3, S8), controlled for weight and diet changes, was associated with higher T2D incidence among persons with the PPARγ rs1801282 Ala‐ and rs17036314 C‐alleles compared with persons with the ProPro‐ and GG‐genotypes. Contrary, an increase of LTPA resulted in lower T2D incidence among persons with the ADRA2B Glu12‐allele, with the ABCC8 rs3758947 GG‐genotype and with the nonrisk haplotype of the four SLC2A2 variants rs5393, rs5394, rs5400, and rs5404, whereas persons with the risk allele seem to be unresponsive to change in LTPA. Several further investigated genetic variants showed no interaction with PA or change in LTPA (Table 3).\n\nFindings for G × L interactions on incident",

Several further investigated genetic variants showed no interaction with PA or change in LTPA (Table 3).\n\nFindings for G × L interactions on incident T2D\n\nFindings of DPP and DPS indicate that interaction between weight loss interventions to reduce diabetes risk and genetic variants may modify the risk to develop T2D (Tables 4 and S9). In both studies, participants with the TCF7L2 rs12255372 risk TT‐genotype showed lower T2D incidence in the intervention group than in the control group. Similar findings were reported for persons with the rs7903146 risk T‐allele by DPP and the Asti study. However, the corresponding interaction tests were not significant. \n\nOther genetic variants have been investigated only in one RCT study populations, respectively. In DPP, the weight loss intervention was associated with a reduced T2D incidence among persons with the diabetogenic variant of ENPP1 rs1044498, and a trend for interaction was found for MC4R rs17066829. Reported interaction findings from DPS indicate that the weight loss intervention resulted in a lower T2D incidence among persons with the PPARγ rs1152003 CC‐genotype, the TNFα rs1800629 GG‐genotype, the ADRA2B Glu9‐allele, and the LIPC rs2070895 A‐allele compared with the reference genotypes.

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nParticipant characteristics for 16,003 initially nondiabetic middle-aged whites are shown in Table 1. To indirectly quantify the validity of the physical activity assessment instrument, we tested the association between physical activity and IGR or diabetes risk after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI. In these models, physical inactivity conveyed a 1.15-fold increased risk (95% CI 1.05–1.26, P = 0.002) of IGR and a 1.41-fold increased risk (1.29–1.57, P < 0.0001) of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe following section describes the results for the models focusing on main genetic effects and gene × physical activity interactions. Unless otherwise stated, all P values are unadjusted for multiple comparisons.\n\nGenetic association models (main effects).\n\nThe associations between each of the polymorphisms with IGR risk and 2-h glucose concentrations are shown in Table 2, ranked by the P value for the test of gene × physical activity interaction. SLC30A8 (rs13266634), TCF7L2 (rs7903146), CDKAL1 (rs7754840), NOTCH2 (rs10923931), KCNJ11 (rs5219), IGFBP2 (rs4402960), JAZF1 (rs864745), HHEX (rs1111875), MTNR1B (rs10830963), and TSPAN8 (rs7961581) all showed evidence for association with IGR risk and/or 2-h glucose concentrations in directions consistent with previous reports. No statistical association was observed between the CDKN2A/B rs10811661 variant and 2-h glucose (β = 0.02 mmol/l per copy of the major allele, P = 0.43) or the risk of having IGR (vs. NGR; odds ratio [OR] 1.08 per copy of the major allele, 95% CI 0.99–1.15, P = 0.08). Similarly, no statistical association was observed for the HNF1B rs4430796 variant and 2-h glucose (β = 0.02 mmol/l per copy of the minor allele, P = 0.65) or IGR risk (OR 1.02 per copy of the minor allele, 95% CI 0.97–1.08, P = 0.36). The associations between each of the gene variants and type 2 diabetes have previously been described in detail.\n\nGene × physical activity interaction models.\n\nStatistical power calculations are shown in Table 3 for all variants. As shown in Table 2, no statistical evidence of interaction emerged for the majority of the polymorphisms tested. The remaining section focuses on the variants for which the uncorrected interaction terms were statistically significant (Pinteraction < 0.05) for at least one of the three outcomes of interest in this report.\n\nHNF1B (rs4430796).\n\nThe gene × physical activity interaction terms for HNF1B (rs4430796) on IGR risk and on 2-h glucose concentrations were both statistically significant (Pinteraction = 0.026 and 0.0009, respectively), and the latter remained significant after correction for multiple hypothesis testing (Pinteraction = 0.015). Although not statistically significant, the minor A allele at HNF1B rs4430796 tended to be associated with lower risk of IGR (OR 0.92 per allele, 95% CI 0.82–1.03, P = 0.13) in physically inactive individuals (n = 3,335) and with increased risk (1.06, 1.00–1.12, P = 0.066) in physically active individuals (n = 12,015). In a concordant manner, the minor A allele was associated with lower 2-h glucose levels (β = −0.13 mmol/l per allele, P = 0.005) in physically inactive individuals (n = 1,619), with a contrasting effect (0.04, P = 0.056) in physically active individuals (n = 6,981) (Fig. 1). The Cox proportional hazards regression model testing the gene × baseline physical activity interaction term on type 2 diabetes as the outcome yielded an uncorrected P value of 0.0004 (corrected Pinteraction = 0.0068). The nature of the interaction reflected those observed in the glucose regulation models, where the minor allele was associated with decreased risk of diabetes in sedentary individuals (hazard rate ratio [HRR] = 0.85; 95% CI 0.74–0.96; P = 0.011), with a contrasting effect in physically active individuals (HRR = 1.10; 95% CI 1.03–1.18; P = 0.007). To illustrate this interaction, cumulative incidence curves were plotted stratified by genotype and level of physical activity (see Fig. 2).\n\nCDKN2A/B (rs10811661).\n\nThe interaction terms for the CDKN2A/B rs10811661 polymorphism and physical activity, with IGR risk or 2-h glucose concentrations as outcomes, were both nominally statistically significant (Pinteraction = 0.015 and 0.013, respectively). Though not statistically significant, the minor allele at rs10811661 tended to be associated with higher risk of IGR (OR 1.10 per allele, 95% CI 0.95–1.28, P = 0.20) in physically inactive individuals (n = 3,468), but it was protective of IGR risk (",

Similarly, in physically inactive individuals (n = 1,618), the rs10811661 minor allele tended to be associated with elevated 2-h glucose concentrations (β = 0.12 mmol/l per allele, P = 0.064), whereas in physically active individuals (n = 6,680), a contrasting effect was observed (−0.06, P = 0.070), although neither was statistically significant. No statistical evidence of interaction was observed where type 2 diabetes was the outcome (Pinteraction = 0.57).\n\nPPARG (rs1801282).\n\nThe interaction between the PPARG rs1801282 polymorphism and physical activity on IGR risk was nominally statistically significant (Pinteraction = 0.04). In inactive individuals, the minor allele appeared to be protective of IGR (OR 0.88 per allele, 95% CI 0.75–1.02, P = 0.097), whereas this effect was reversed in active individuals (1.05, 0.97–1.15, P = 0.22), albeit neither stratified effect was statistically significant.

Therefore, we tested age- and sex-adjusted BMI interaction terms for each SNP with the dependent variable being IGR vs. NGR. In these models, only one term, for ADAMTS9 rs4607103, was nominally statistically significant (Pinteraction = 0.024). The BMI interaction terms for the CDKN2A/B rs10811661 (Pinteraction = 0.973), HNF1B rs4430796 (Pinteraction = 0.763), and PPARG rs1801282 (Pinteraction = 0.724) variants did not approach statistical significance. The inclusion or exclusion of BMI as a covariate in the SNP × physical activity interaction models made no material difference to the interaction results, and no novel interaction effects emerged.",

Of the 17 394 participants, 42.8%, 42.5% and 14.7% displayed normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance (IFG/IGT) or T2D, respectively. The ethnic distribution of individuals was significantly different in the NGT, IFG/IGT and T2D groups. There was a decreasing percentage of IFG/IGT in subjects of East Asian (66.9%), African (62.8%), European (61.0%), Native North American (55.8%), Latino American (55.5%) and South Asian (43.5%) ancestry (Supplementary Table 3). There was a decreasing percentage of T2D in subjects of East Asian (22.7%), African (18.0%), South Asian (16.1%), European (14.4%), Latino American (12.9%) and Native North American (11.8%) ancestry (Supplementary Table 3). Overall, IFG/IGT and T2D subjects were on average 5.5–6.5 years older than the NGT subjects. The percentage of females was higher across all glycemic statuses (60.9%), but males were more likely to be IFG/IGT or T2D in comparison to NGT counterparts (Table 1).\n\nEffect of baseline glycemic status on BMI level and BMI change\n\nIFG/IGT and T2D status were positively associated with BMI at baseline when compared with the NGT group (IFG/IGT: β = 0.34 ± 0.02, P = 1.35 × 10−98; T2D: β = 0.44 ± 0.02, P = 5.25 × 10−80; Table 2). There was an association between IFG/IGT status at baseline and lower BMI change during the 3.3 year follow-up in comparison with NGT subjects (IFG/IGT: β = −0.13 ± 0.03, P = 3.65 × 10−7). A significant negative association between T2D status at baseline and BMI change was also observed in comparison with NGT subjects (β = −0.34 ± 0.04, P = 1.06 × 10−19; Table 2). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and two-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) at baseline were positively associated with BMI at baseline (FPG: β = 0.19 ± 0.01, P = 1.80 × 10−145; 2hPG: β = 0.20 ± 0.01, P = 4.26 × 10−159; Table 2) and were negatively associated with BMI change during the follow-up period (FPG: β = −0.09 ± 0.01, P = 8.47 × 10−14 and 2hPG: β = −0.10 ± 0.01, P = 1.28 × 10−19; Table 2).\n\nEffect of glycemic status transition on BMI level and BMI change\n\nThe transition from NGT to IFG/IGT was positively associated with BMI at baseline (β = 0.19 ± 0.04, P = 2.60 × 10−7; Table 3) and BMI change (β = 0.19 ± 0.04, P = 2.93 × 10−6). Compared to stable NGT, converting from NGT to T2D showed a positive association with BMI at baseline (β = 0.36 ± 0.08, P = 4.35 × 10−6) and BMI change (β = 0.38 ± 0.09, P = 2.25 × 10−5), with two fold higher baseline and delta beta values compared to that observed in IFG/IGT converters. Similarly, the transition from IFG/IGT to T2D was positively associated with BMI at baseline (β = 0.20 ± 0.03, P = 6.28 × 10−11), in comparison to stable IFG/IGT over the study period. However, this association was not significant for BMI change (β = 0.06 ± 0.04, P = 8.28 × 10−2). The change in FPG levels was significantly associated with a positive increase in BMI change (β = 0.16 ± 0.01, P = 1.1 × 10−52), but was not associated with baseline BMI (β = −0.01 ± 0.01, P = 0.52). An association between change in 2hPG levels, with BMI at baseline (β = −0.03 ± 0.01, P = 1.6 ×10−3) as well as with BMI change (β = 0.17 ± 0.01, P = 2.4 × 10−45; Table 3) was also observed.\n\nMain association and interaction between obesity predisposing SNPs, glycemic status on BMI level and BMI change\n\nAssoci",

Three of 23 SNPs reached a significant association with BMI at baseline with a direction of effect consistent with published GWAS data: rs9939609 in FTO, rs2984618 in TAL1, and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 (0.04 ≤ β ≤ 0.08; 1.4 × 10−14 ≤ P ≤ 1.8 × 10−5; Table 4).

Interactions between obesity SNPs, GRS and traits related to glycemic status transition on BMI at baseline and BMI change are reported in Table 5.

(Table 1 and Figure 1) The creatinine at the three month baseline was 1.4 ± 0.48 mg/dl. After the first three months post-transplant, 366 (16 %) recipients experienced CGD with a rate of 11.2 per 100 person-years. The mean time to CGD diagnosis was 509 ± 387 days from the three month baseline. Creatinine at the time of CGD was 2.7 ± 1.5 mg/dl. The factors that were independently associated with CGD were donor age and recipient characteristics such as age, smoking status and recipient-donor CMV status, after adjusting for African-American recipient race,.\n\nCGD and Allograft Survival\n\nDuring the mean follow-up of 21 months post-transplant, 66 (3%) died and 75 (3%) developed death-censored allograft failure. Death was not statistically different between the CGD group versus the non-CGD group [14 (4%) vs. 52 (3%), p=0.23]. Death-censored allograft failure was significantly higher in the CGD group versus the non-CGD group [56 (15%) vs 19 (1%), p<0.0001]. In a multivariate model, CGD was independently associated with increased risk of death-censored allograft failure [HR=20.6 (11.8 – 35.8, p<0.0001)]. In this model younger recipient age, longer duration of dialysis pre-transplant and higher creatinine at the three month baseline, were also independently associated with increased risk of death-censored allograft failure. The recipients without a biopsy who had a rise in serum creatinine were assessed to ensure that the cases were not misclassified. A chart review was conducted for recipients that had a 50% rise in creatinine from the 3 month baseline, but had no biopsy. The 17 recipients with such a rise in creatinine, had dehydration or intercurrent medical illness as the cause of the rise.\n\nBiopsy findings in CGD\n\nThe CGD biopsy scores (Table 2) among the 366 recipients with i and t scores reported by the local pathologists, revealed significant amount of interstitial inflammation and tubulitis. Ninety-four (26% of 366) of the CGD biopsies had a Banff score consistent with AR with t-score more than 1 and i-score more than 1. (Table 2) The respective tables also show the presence of C4d positive status. These CGD biopsies with AR had chronic as well as acute changes. The rate of death censored allograft failure after the diagnoses of CGD did not differ between the CGD subgroup with concomitant AR and the CGD subgroup without AR (log-rank test, p-value=0.22). (Figure 2) The mean creatinine (IQR) after the diagnosis of CGD remained elevated from the reference creatinine in both sub-groups, 1.80 (1.50 – 3.10) mg/dl in subgroup with concomitant AR and 1.90 (1.50–2.45) mg/dl in the subgroup without concomitant AR. This creatinine was measured at a median (IQR) of 21 (12 – 30) days after the CGD event. Therefore, these groups were analyzed together for the SNP analysis.\n\nSNPs Associated with CGD\n\nThe initial 979 patients which represent the test cohort were genotyped for SNPs and their characteristics are described in Table 3. There were some differences in the characteristics of the test cohort compared to the remaining non-test cohort. These differences were primarily due to center specific practices and referral patterns such as use of induction agents, use of dialysis post-transplant, proportion of pre-sensitized candidates and steroid withdrawal. Transplant centers’ volume did vary from year to year, thus patients in the test and non-test cohort do not represent the same proportion of patients from all the seven centers. Therefore, the analysis in the test cohort was stratified by transplant center in order to minimize the effects of these center specific characteristics. In this test cohort, a Cox proportional hazards model was developed to adjust for recipient race and other confounders, and stratifying by transplant center. In this adjusted model, donor age and recipient characteristics such as smoking status, recipient-donor CMV status, and age were independently associated with CGD. In this test cohort composed of the 979 initial subjects, with 194 (20% of 979) CGD events, the top 15 SNPs associated with CGD, all p<0.01, are shown in Table 4. Four SNPs were significantly associated with CGD after accounting for a FDR of 20%. These 4 SNPs were in genes FM06 and FM03. These genes are flavin-containing mono-oxygenases (FMOs) consisting of five microsomal enzymes important for the oxidative metabolism of environmental toxins and therapeutic agents. Thus, these SNPs could play a role in metabolism of immunosuppressive agents. Our previously published study in this population, has shown that another SNP in FMO3 was associated with tacrolimus levels. This other SNP in FMO3 was not in linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs shown in Table 4. (r2<0.3) There is significant sequence homology between FMO6 and FMO3.

Supplemental Table 1 shows the association of all SNPs genotyped with CGD.\n\nSNPs Associated with Severity of Tubular Atrophy and Interstitial Fibrosis\n\nFor the analysis of severity of these chronic scores among the 979 recipients in the test cohort, we excluded the less than 1% (30) biopsies from 24 subjects with missing scores and excluded all 21 subjects with 3 biopsies from a single center that had no ct scores ≥2. Then the test cohort comprised of a total of 934 recipients: 687 with no biopsies for cause, 168 with CGD biopsies and 79 with biopsies and no CGD. All 79 recipients with biopsies and no CGD did not have a 25% or greater rise in creatinine from their baseline. In this observational study, the need for biopsy was determined by the treating physician and physicians did order biopsies for other causes such as proteinuria. In order to assess the severity of ct-scores, we divided the test cohort into 3 groups: ct score ≥2 (n=52), ct-score ≤1 (n=195) and no biopsy group (n=687). During the median follow-up of 21 months post-transplant, the rate of return to dialysis or re-transplantation was 23% in the ct ≥ 2 group, 8% in the ct ≤ 1 and less than 1% in the no biopsy group. The top 15 SNPs potentially associated with ct ≥2 versus ct ≤ 1 (p<0.01), in a multivariate analysis adjusted for important confounders, are shown in Table 5. Confounders included SPK versus kidney alone, donor age, recipient age, recipient African American race, and baseline creatinine at 3 months post-transplant, smoking status and steroid withdrawal status at 14 days post-transplant. In this adjusted model, the top two SNPs (p<0.001) that were potentially associated with severity of ct-score were rs8179183 and rs3828034 in LEPR, a gene belonging to the family of cytokine receptors. The third SNPs were rs593421 in CYP4F12 gene, which is a member of the cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing enzyme. None of the top 15 SNPs were significant after accounting for an FDR of 20%. Supplemental Table 2 shows the association of all SNPs genotyped with severity of ct-scores. There was significant correlation between the ct (tubular atrophy) and ci (interstitial fibrosis scores) (Spearman correlation=0.88, p<0.0001), therefore the analysis was not repeated for ci scores.",

    "content": "Results\n\nThe proportion of rare variants in VIP genes\n\nWe first procured whole exome sequencing (WES) datasets, the first consisting of 10,000 datasets, from the Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples (T2D-GENES) initiative, and the second consisting of 3,000 datasets from the Genetics of Type 2 diabetes (Go-T2D) repository. From the PharmGKB data analysis, we selected 48 genes, annotated as “Very Important Pharmacogenes” (VIPs) in PharmGKB (PMID: 11908751). We removed two genes from the original 50 because one was on the sex chromosome and the other was not present in our WES data. Thus, we analyzed 48 VIP genes to determine those with high levels of population differentiation (PD). Since most of the variants in our WES data were less common or rare, the selected 48 VIP genes mostly consisted of rare variants. The proportions of common variants in VIP genes are shown in Fig. 1. The overall proportion of common variants in VIP genes was 2.80% (max: 8.22%, min: 0%), and most MAFs of variants from the WES dataset were less than 0.05. \n\nVery small Fst from the variants in 48 VIP genes\n\nWe first calculated fixation index (Fst) values for all the variants of each VIP gene. For this, we used Weir’s estimate, because it is unbiased, even when the sample sizes are unequal. Since most of the variants were rare, their Fst values were also very small. For this reason, the median Fst values for the 48 VIP genes were all less than 0.01, and only six VIP genes had at least one variant with an Fst greater than 0.25. These high Fst values were all from common variants, with MAFs greater than 0.05. For instance, rs1229984(T/C) showed the largest Fst, 0.55, among the variants annotated to the 48 VIP genes, where the minor nucleotide for East Asian is T instead of C, and the frequency of the allele C of East Asian is 0.7445. The nine variants with Fst values greater than 0.25, from the six VIP genes, are summarized in Table 1. Although the MAFs of two variants, rs4846051 in MTHFR and rs6012687, in PTGIS, were not much higher than 0.05 (0.0532 and 0.0628, respectively), the Fst values of the two variants were 0.3000 and 0.2803, respectively. Moreover, racial or ethnic differences were found in the allele frequencies of rs4846051, related to the variation of response to methotrexate, in rheumatoid arthritis. \n\nFigure 2 shows that the distribution of Fst in our WES data varied according to the VIP genes’ MAFs. This also shows that the maximum Fst, for all the variants with MAFs < 3%, was less than 0.25. Thus, Fst could not detect the variants of PD when their MAFs were smaller than 3%. In our WES data, 97.5% of the variants had MAFs smaller than 3%. Thus, the majority of variants in our data could not be identified, more specifically, as variants of PD. On the other hand, the common variants with MAFs >5% could be easily identified as variants of PD, by using Fst. \n\nFor the VIP genes, 97.14% of variants had MAFs of less than 3%. Thus, the mere use of Fst made it difficult to identify VIP variants related to PD.\n\nSKAT analysis for all VIPgenes\n\nWe additionally performed the sequence kernel association test (SKAT) for all VIPgenes, even while our objective and the scope of analyses were limited to detecting differences between a pair of populations, at the gene-level. As expected, an association was found for most pairwise comparison of ancestral groups for VIP genes (472 from 480 pairs) after Bonferroni correction. Specifically, for all VIPgenes, there were large differences in African Americans, due to their distinct genetic history. Since SKAT can only perform for pairwise comparison of ancestral groups, these results are rather limited. For a more comprehensive comparison of all five ancestral groups, SKAT must be extended, to compare multiple groups.\n\nThe PDRC tests for VIP genes\n\nThree different weighting schemes, equal weights, inverse of MAF, and inverse of MAF2 (square of MAF) were adopted to compute PDRC test statistics. If we identified highly differentiated pharmacogenes among the 48 VIP genes by p-value, the number of those identified varied substantially in different weighting schemes. The p-values from PDRC tests, with equal weight, were very small, while the weight based on the inverse of MAF mitigated this phenomenon, as we already mentioned, such that the implementation of weight based on the inverse of MAF could reduce the false positive rate. Note that only two genes, BRCA1 and CYP2B6, were identified by all nine of our different analyses (three strategies and three different weighting schemes), when we considered the p-values after Bonferroni correction. Considering that the equal weight is prone to increased false positive rates, the test result from the equal weighting scheme can be easily violated. Additionally, we evaluated the distribution of PDRC test statistics for each selection strategy and weighting scheme (Table 2), using all 18,281 genes in our WES datasets. We then calculated the 95th percentile for all PDRC results",

Additionally, we evaluated the distribution of PDRC test statistics for each selection strategy and weighting scheme (Table 2), using all 18,281 genes in our WES datasets. We then calculated the 95th percentile for all PDRC results. We selected the PD genes among the top 5% of genes and provided a more detailed description. The top 5% percentile of the PD measurement, from all the genes in the datasets, has often been used for PD detection  \n\nFirstly, we obtained the gene-based summary statistics by using an ‘all variant’ selection strategy. Although the impact of synonymous variants on proteins was not confirmed, we assumed that all the SNPs possessed the potential for phenotypic variation. With the weights based on the inverse of MAF, PD values of all 48 genes were identified (p-value [Bonferroni, n = 48] < 0.05), making it possible to claim that all the VIP genes are highly differentiated (Table 3). On the other hand, considering the 95th percentile of the statistics, 6 genes, ACE, CYP2B6, DPYD, F5, MTHFR, and SCN5A, seemed to be specifically differentiated among the VIP genes. With weights based on the inverse of MAF2, PD values for all 48 genes identified (p-value [Bonferroni, n = 48] < 0.05), and the statistics from four genes, CYP2B6, DPYD, F5, and SCN5A, were larger than the 95th percentile. \n\nSecondly, when the PDRC test uses a ‘rare/less-common’ variant selection strategy, the results are similar to tests using all the variants (Table 3). Due to the fact that the weights, based on the MAFs, enable the PDRC test to put more weight on rare variants, PDRC tests using two different variant selection strategies, ‘all’ and ‘rare/less-common’ yielded the same list of genes.\n\nThirdly, when the PDRC test uses a ‘protein-altering’ variant selection strategy, a different list of genes was obtained (Table 4). In this case, the PDRC test identified PD in 10 and 12 genes with PD, with weights of the inverse of MAF and the inverse of MAF2, respectively (p-value [Bonferroni, n = 48] < 0.05). By the evaluated 95th percentile, one (CYP2E1) and six genes (BRCA1, CYP2B6, DPYD, F5, MTHFR, and EGFR) were selected with weights of the inverse of MAF and inverse of MAF2, respectively. Since the PDRC test combined all the effects of common and rare variants, while up-weighting rare variants, it successfully selected highly differentiated VIP genes that could not be detected by Fst. \n\nGenes identified via PDRC test with supporting evidence\n\nFrom our PDRC test results using an ‘all’ or ‘rare/less-common’ variant selection strategy, PDs for all 48 VIP genes were identified, and supported by known PD values in many SNPs of VIP genes, based on microarray-derived previous research. When we additionally evaluated the 95th percentile of PDRC statistics, with weights based on either inverse of MAF or MAF2 (square of MAF) six genes, BRCA1, CYP2E1, ACE, CYP2B6, SCN5A, and EGFR, were selected, with no variants having Fst values greater than 0.25. Therefore, we propose these six genes to be specifically differentiated pharmacogenes, among other VIP genes. Besides, we found supporting evidence for high PD levels in these six genes, from either ethnic variation at the genetic, or epigenetic, level. The ethnic variations in genetic sequences of six genes have been reported, but the PDs of these genes could not be identified via Fst. Genetic polymorphisms can be combined at the gene level, and their synergic variability could potentially affect the PD of either gene expression or phenotypes. For this reason, the gene-based statistic, PDRC, is advantageous for finding potential PDs at the epigenetic level. In fact, we specifically found evidence for PD at epigenetic level of three genes CYP2B6, ACE, and SCN5A; we will describe them in the following paragraph.\n\nHepatic CYP2B6 expression is variable by ethnicity. Note that the maximum Fst among the SNPs in CYP2B6 was less than 0.08, but the combined effect of the rare variants seemed to affect the variation in gene expression. In fact, there were only two common variants in CYP2B6 from our WES data. This result shows that although a gene does not contain any SNPs, with large Fst values, it can be a gene with a high level of PD having large effects on expression levels. The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios from each pair of ancestry groups are summarized in Table 5. Here, the European ancestry group is used as a baseline ancestry. African Americans tended to have more minor alleles than Europeans in our WES data (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, 2.33; 95% CI, 2.23 to 2.42). If we suppose that the minor allele potentially reduces a gene’s fitness, defined as the availability of a",

If we suppose that the minor allele potentially reduces a gene’s fitness, defined as the availability of a gene to perform a particular function, this may play a role in female African Americans having the lowest CYP2B6 expression. \n\nACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme, yielded the second largest test statistic when ‘all’ variants were used, with the weight of inverse of MAF. The maximum Fst value among the SNPs in ACE was less than 0.2. ACE also was the predominant enzyme for bradykinin metabolism in human, where bradykinin is a potent endogenous, endothelium-dependent vasodilator. Consequently, reduced bradykinin expression could affect hypertension. Since angiotensin is a vasoconstrictor, ACE inhibitors are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, although their efficacy has been reported to vary among different ethnic groups. In addition, another previous study reported an interactive effect of ethnicity and an ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism associated with vascular reactivity, and our current analysis result also showed ethnic sensitivity to ACE inhibitors. In our WES data, African Americans tended to have more minor alleles than Europeans (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio = 1.90; 95% CI, 1.85 to 1.96), which is concordant with the phenotype of significantly attenuated vasodilation in Africans, when compared to Europeans. The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios and their confidence intervals are summarized in Table 5.\n\nSCN5A, the sodium channel (voltage-gated) type V alpha subunit, includes variants with Fst values less than 0.14. However, the rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a SCN5A-related pathological phenotype, is likely related to ethnicity. For instance, the prevalence of CVD is higher in rural southeastern regions of the US, with the largest African American population, compared to other regions. Similarly, Hispanics and African Americans have different genetic backgrounds, and patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD), compared to populations of European descent. Also, it is possible that genetic variation in SCN5A associates with electrocardiography (ECG), and cardiac traits that can vary, depending on the ancestral populations, and this possibility is supported by the results of our analysis. African Americans, South Asians, and East Asians tended to have more minor alleles than Europeans in our WES data (Table 5). For instance, the Mantel-Haenszel odds of SCN5A from African Americans are 2.98 times higher than those from Europeans, at a 95% confidence level between 2.87 times higher and 3.10 times higher. This result also supports that PD of SCN5A potentially affecting ethnic variation of CVD prevalence, which is higher in African Americans than Europeans.",

Of them 750 migraineurs were excluded because of reasons such as nonfulfillment of the inclusion criterial, refusal to participate in a placebo-controlled trial and other reasons. In total, 300 participants were initially enrolled in the trial and were randomly assigned in the ration of 1:2 to either the placebo group or the vitamin- treated group respectively, but seven participants dropped out before the commencement of the trial and 36 participants dropped out at baseline assessment. Two hundred and fifty seven participants received baseline assessment and successfully commenced trial. One hundred and seventy participants were included in the vitamin- treated group and the remaining 87 participants were included in the placebo- treated group. Sixty eight participants were lost to follow-up because of lack of compliance and 189 participants completed the trial (126 Vitamin treated, 63 Placebo treated).\n\nBaseline analysis\n\nTable 1 shows the baseline clinical characteristics of the participant group. The mean folate concentration was 33.7 nmol/l and 35.6 nmol/l for the placebo and the treatment group respectively, which were above the average folate concentration of 13.7 nmol/l in the general Caucasian population. The mean plasma homocysteine concentration was 9.5 μmol/l and 9.4 μmol/l for the placebo and the treatment group respectively, which were slightly above the average plasma homocysteine level of 8.9 μmol/l in the general Caucasian population. The mean B6 and B12 levels at baseline for both the placebo and treatment groups were within the normal range for a general Caucasian population. The percentage of participants with high migraine frequency and high migraine severity did not significantly differ between the placebo and the treatment group at baseline, however the percentage of participants with high migraine disability significantly differed between the placebo and the treatment group (P =0.02). The placebo group had an increased proportion of participants (91 %) with high migraine disability compared to the treatment group (79 %).\n\nValues are mean (SD) or n (%)\n\nFor the blood biochemistries at follow-up (Table 2) - folate, B6 and B12 levels were significantly higher in the treatment group compared to placebo group (P < 0.0001) after 6 months of intervention. Plasma homocysteine levels remained at 9.5 μmol/l for the placebo group while in the treatment group, plasma homocysteine levels decreased from 9.4 to 8.5 μmol/l after the 6 months of intervention. However this decrease was not statistically significant (P = 0.2). This result is in contrast to our previous results testing the effect of 2 mg of folic acid, which showed a statistically significant reduction in mean homocysteine (P < 0.001) in the treatment group. The baseline Hcy plasma levels of the treatment group was lower in the current trial (9.4 μmol/l) compared to the previous trial, this is most likely due to the higher level of baseline folate levels in the current trial (35.6 nmol/l) compared to the previous trial (31.4 nmol/l), which displays a possible floor effect.\n\nFor the migraine clinical outcomes at follow-up (Table 3) the treatment group had a lower percentage of participants with high migraine disability, severity and frequency compared to the placebo group at the end of the 6 month intervention. However, these differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.1).\n\nWhen the treatment group was stratified by the MTHFR C677T genotype, an overall decrease in the percentage of high migraine disability, frequency and severity was observed for all three genotype groups after the 6 months of intervention however the decrease was not statistically significant(P > 0.10).",

Study participants were diagnosed between 1987 and 2001 and treated on various protocols, primarily Pediatric Oncology Group protocols (including POG 9005, POG 9006, POG 9405, POG 9605, POG 8698, and POG 8699). Early MTX-related neurotoxicity occurred in 7 patients (9.7%). Impairment on the DIVERGT battery was observed in 44.3% of the study population. Mean neurocognitive test scores in the overall population demonstrated mild deficits on PEGDH (p=0.02), PEGNDH (p<0.001) and CFL (p<0.001), when compared to the expected means of 100 (Table II). All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nGenotype and Impairment on the DIVERGT Battery\n\nImpairment on the battery was related to two polymorphisms: MTHFR 1298A>C (p=0.03) and MS 2756A>G (p=0.05). Survivors with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes had a 3.0-fold increased risk of impairment (95% CI 1.1-8.1), compared to those with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype. Similarly, those with the MS 2756 AA genotype were 3.8 times as likely to meet criteria for impairment on the battery as those with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes. MTHFR 677C>T, SHMT 1520C>T, MTRR 66A>G, and TSER polymorphisms were not significantly related to general impairment on the DIVERGT battery.\n\nGenotype and Individual Child Performance Measures\n\nSeveral genotypes were related to performance on TMTA (focused attention, processing speed) and TMTB (shifting attention, processing speed), as shown in Table III. Survivors with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes performed on average 7 points lower on TMTA (p=0.11) and 13 points lower on TMTB (p=0.001), compared to those with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype. Survivors with the MS 2756AA genotype scored on average 12.2 points lower on TMTA (p=0.01) and 5.3 points lower on TMTB (p=0.23), compared to survivors with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes. Finally, survivors with TSER 2R/3R and 3R/3R genotypes scored on average 10 points lower on TMTA (p=0.07) and 11.4 points lower on TMTB (p=0.03) than those with the TSER 2R/2R genotype. MTHFR 677C>T, SHMT 1420C>T, and MTRR 66A>G polymorphisms were not associated with performance on TMTA or TMTB. Complete analyses by genotypes for all six performance measures can be found in Supplemental Table I.\n\nThe remaining neurocognitive tests assessed fine motor skills (PEGDH and PEGNDH), working memory (DIG), and executive function (CFL). For survivors with the MS 2756AA genotype, the mean PEGNDH score was 11.7 points lower than that of individuals with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes (p=0.02). Additionally, survivors with the MTRR 66AA genotype scored on average 10.7 points lower on PEGNDH than those with the MTRR 66AG/GG genotypes (p=0.05). Survivors with the MTRR 66AA genotype also scored 10.5 points lower on average on CFL, compared with survivors with the MTRR 66AG/GG genotypes (p=0.01). Performance on the PEGDH and DIG measures were not associated with any genotype.\n\nWe did not observe an association between any child performance measure and any of the following covariates: sex, ethnicity/race, age at diagnosis, leukemia subtype, number of intrathecal MTX doses, and cumulative IV MTX exposure. The associations between genotype and child performance measures that are described above did not change after adjustment for these covariates. Of the 7 survivors with a history of early MTX-related neurotoxicity, 6 (85%) met criteria for long-term neurocognitive impairment on the DIVERGT battery. While early MTX-related neurotoxicity was predictive of long-term neurocognitive impairment (p=0.03), 25 of 63 survivors (40%) without early MTX-related neurotoxicity also went on to develop long-term neurocognitive impairment as determined by the DIVERGT battery. The 7 survivors with a history of early MTX-related neurotoxicity scored on average 15.3 points lower on TMTB than survivors without early neurotoxicity (p=0.03). Early MTX-related neurotoxicity was not predictive of impairment on TMTA, PEGDH, PEGNDH, DIG, or CFL.\n\nComplete genotyping results for all six polymorphisms were available for computation of the GRS in 59 patients.

    "content": "Results\n\nJAK pathway signaling regulates NOD2-induced cytokine secretion and tolerance in multiple myeloid cell types\n\nJAK inhibitors are in clinical trials for IBD. Although they suppress T cell-mediated inflammation, the outcomes in myeloid cells are more controversial. Some studies indicate that JAK inhibition decreases proinflammatory outcomes on exposure to microbial components, whereas others show it increases proinflammatory outcomes under these conditions. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines would likely not be favorable when treating IBD patients given the continual exposure of intestinal myeloid cells to microbial products. We therefore examined how JAK protein reduction regulates pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines during acute and chronic PRR stimulation, as observed with initial entry and prolonged monocyte residence in the intestinal lamina propria, respectively. We effectively knocked down each JAK member (Supplementary Fig. 1B) in human MDMs and ensured cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 1C). JAK knockdown did not decrease PRR levels in MDMs (Supplementary Fig. 1D); such regulation has been reported in human epithelial cells. Moreover, we established that NOD2 stimulation activates JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 (Fig. 1A), and that knockdown of each JAK selectively reduced activation of the targeted JAK (Fig. 1A). Knockdown of each JAK, alone or in combination, increased pro-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-12), but decreased anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL-1ra) cytokine secretion following acute NOD2 stimulation of MDMs and monocytes (Fig. 1B). As JAK inhibition distinctly regulated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, we next examined M1- and M2-polarized macrophages. M1 macrophages secrete increased PRR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, and M2 macrophages secrete increased anti-inflammatory cytokines compared to non-polarized MDMs. We ensured proper differentiation of M1 and M2 macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 1E) as per previously published human markers. Knockdown of each JAK family member further increased the high levels of NOD2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in M1 macrophages, and decreased the anti-inflammatory cytokines in M2 macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 1F).\n\nIL-10, which signals through the JAK pathway and is in turn secreted following JAK signaling, contributes to the anti-inflammatory phenotype observed in intestinal macrophages. Moreover, early autocrine IL-10 regulates the decreased cytokines observed during NOD2-induced tolerance. We therefore hypothesized that JAKs would be required for optimal NOD2-induced tolerance. We found this to be the case for each JAK family member (Fig. 1C & D). Knockdown of all four JAK proteins further reversed the decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion under chronic conditions (Fig. 1D), such that the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels increased from ~10% to ~60% relative to acute NOD2 stimulation. In contrast, and consistent with the requirement we observed for JAK family members in anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, anti-inflammatory cytokines further decreased in these chronically MDP pre-treated cells (Fig. 1D). TLR2- and TLR4-induced cytokine secretion was regulated by JAKs similarly to that observed with NOD2 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Taken together, dramatically decreasing the expression of JAK family members reciprocally regulates pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines; pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased and anti-inflammatory cytokines are decreased following both acute and chronic PRR stimulation in multiple primary human myeloid cell types.\n\nNOD2-induced autocrine inhibitory mediators that signal through the JAK pathway regulate NOD2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines\n\nWe next sought to define mechanisms for the JAK-dependence in NOD2-induced anti-inflammatory cytokines and NOD2-mediated tolerance. PRR-stimulated MDMs secrete autocrine/paracrine IL-10 which signals through the JAK pathway. Autocrine IL-10 decreases PRR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and induces NOD2-mediated tolerance. We hypothesized that additional autocrine/paracrine inhibitory mediators that signal through JAKs would be required for these outcomes. We first examined type I IFNs which signal through JAKs and can decrease PRR-induced cytokine secretion. JAK signaling was required for NOD2-induced IFN-α in MDMs and pDCs, and IFN-α was also decreased following chronic NOD2 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 3A & B). IFN-β secretion was similarly regulated in pDCs (Supplementary Fig. 3B), but was not secreted in MDMs (data not shown). However, effective knockdown of IFNAR, required for both IFN-α and IFN-β signaling, neither altered acute nor chronic NOD2-induced cytokine secretion (Supplementary Fig. 3C & D), indicating that autocrine/paracrine type I IFN signaling in and of itself was not required to regulate cytokine secretion during acute or chronic NOD2 stimulation in MDMs.\n\nWe next examined additional putative inhibitory cytokines that signal through JAKs, with a focus on their role in MDMs. We did not detect IL-3, IL-9, IL-11, IL-13, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) transcripts (data not shown), and did not observe a significant increase in IL-29, IL-30 or leptin mRNA upon NOD2 stimulation (Fig. 2A). However, NOD2 stimulation induced IL-10",

However, NOD2 stimulation induced IL-10, IL-4, IL-22, IL-27, EBI3 and TSLP transcripts (Fig. 2A). We therefore knocked down the receptor for each of these regulated cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 3E) and ensured that the cells were viable (data not shown). Autocrine IL-10 and IL-4 signaling most strongly contributed to the reciprocal regulation of acute NOD2-induced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion as well as to NOD2-induced tolerance (Fig. 2B). IL-22 and TSLP signaling also regulated these outcomes (Fig. 2B). However, neither IL-27 nor EBI3 signaling contributed to acute or chronic NOD2-induced outcomes (data not shown). Importantly, combined IL-10, IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP receptor knockdown even more dramatically increased acute NOD2-induced pro-inflammatory and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion and impaired NOD2-mediated tolerance (Fig. 2B). This indicates cooperation between these factors in MDMs (Fig. 2B) and monocytes (data not shown). We confirmed the importance of these autocrine cytokines through an additional independent approach using neutralizing IL-10, IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP Abs (Fig. 2C). We ensured that in addition to IL-10 (Fig 1B), secretion of the inhibitory proteins IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP was observed following acute NOD2 stimulation, but was decreased following chronic stimulation (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the decreased IL-10 and IL-1ra secretion with JAK pathway inhibition, JAK knockdown led to a significant decrease of IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP secretion upon both acute and chronic NOD2 stimulation (Fig. 2D). We next questioned how these autocrine/paracrine cytokines regulate NOD2-induced JAK pathway activation in human MDMs. Combined IL-10, IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP receptor knockdown significantly decreased acute NOD2-induced activation of each JAK member (Fig. 2E). With chronic NOD2 stimulation, activation of each JAK member was decreased relative to that observed with acute NOD2 stimulation (Fig. 2E), although activation was still increased relative to untreated MDMs. Combined IL-10, IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP receptor knockdown further decreased JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 signaling (Fig. 2E), indicating that these anti-inflammatory cytokines contribute to residual JAK signaling even following chronic NOD2 stimulation. Therefore, upon PRR stimulation, JAKs are both activated in response to the inhibitory autocrine/paracrine cytokines IL-10, IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP (Fig. 2E) and are required for their optimal secretion (Fig. 2D) in a feedforward manner. These cytokines, in turn, cooperate to downregulate proinflammatory and upregulate anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion in myeloid cells following acute NOD2 stimulation, and to the overall downregulation of cytokines observed with NOD2-induced tolerance.\n\nIL-10, IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP reciprocally regulate acute NOD2-induced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and are sufficient for cytokine downregulation under chronic treatment conditions\n\nWe next questioned if IL-10, IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP treatment is sufficient to reciprocally regulate pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines during acute NOD2 stimulation, and to induce cytokine downregulation with chronic treatment of MDMs. IL-10 or IL-4 treatment partially decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines during acute NOD2 stimulation, whereas IL-22 or TSLP treatment effects were less pronounced (Fig. 3A). However, combined IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP treatment, and particularly combined IL-10, IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP treatment, cooperated to suppress acute NOD2-mediated pro-inflammatory and enhance anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion (Fig. 3A). We previously found that autocrine IL-10 is required for the optimal decrease in cytokines following chronic NOD2 stimulation. In this study, we found that chronic IL-10 treatment was also sufficient to decrease subsequent NOD2-induced cytokine secretion (Fig 3B). Although chronic IL-22 or TSLP treatment was not sufficient to significantly decrease cytokine secretion following NOD2 restimulation, treatment with IL-4, combined IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP, and particularly combined IL-10, IL-4, IL-22 or TSLP (Fig. 3B), decreased cytokines to levels similar to those observed after chronic NOD2 stimulation (Fig. 1). Taken together, combined IL-10, IL-4, IL-22 and TSLP are both necessary and sufficient for the reciprocal pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine regulation during acute NOD2 stimulation and for the cytokine decrease during NOD2-induced tolerance.\n\nJAK signaling is required for decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in human intestinal",

We therefore next questioned if the JAK pathway regulated human intestinal myeloid cell responses to microbes. Compared to peripheral MDMs, PRR ligand-treated intestinal macrophages secrete significantly lower levels of cytokines, but can secrete cytokines following S. typhimurium exposure. To investigate JAK signaling in intestinal myeloid cells we used three approaches; we targeted JAK2 with SD-1029, inhibited JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 with JAK inhibitor I, and used tofacitinib, which inhibits multiple JAK members and is in therapeutic trials for IBD. The inhibitors have been commonly used in other studies. We used tofacitinib doses that were within range observed in the plasma of subjects treated with this inhibitor. Following JAK inhibition, S. typhimurium-infected intestinal myeloid cells secreted increased pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-8 levels in a JAK inhibitor dose-dependent manner; a similar increase was observed in peripheral MDMs (Supplementary Fig. 3F). Taken together, JAK inhibitors increase pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in human peripheral and intestinal myeloid cells following live pathogenic bacterial exposure.\n\nMDMs from rs10758669 C disease-risk carriers in the JAK2 region demonstrate increased JAK2 expression and increased NOD2-induced JAK2 phosphorylation and cytokine secretion\n\nWe next sought to define how the IBD-associated rs10758669 polymorphism, located in an intergenic region 3kb from JAK2, regulates JAK2 expression and cytokine secretion in human MDMs. Rs10758669 CC risk-carrier MDMs demonstrated increased JAK2 mRNA (Fig. 5A) and protein (Fig. 5B) expression compared to AA carrier MDMs. In contrast, mRNA expression of other genes in the region was not detected (INSL6, INSL4, RLN2, RLN1, PLGRKT) (data not shown) or was not modulated by rs10758669 genotype (CDC37L1, AK3, RCL1, CD274) (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Consistent with the increased JAK2 expression, NOD2-induced JAK2 phosphorylation was increased in rs10758669 CC carrier MDMs (Fig. 5C). Rs10758669 CA carriers showed an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 5A–C).\n\nWe next questioned how JAK2 genotype regulates cytokines following acute NOD2 stimulation. These acute stimulation conditions simulate myeloid cell entry into the intestinal lamina propria under homeostasis; this entry dramatically increases during acute intestinal injury and inflammation. Rs10758669 CC risk allele-carrier MDMs demonstrated increased pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion relative to AA carriers (Fig 5D). Taken together, rs10758669 CC IBD-risk carrier MDMs in the JAK2 region demonstrate increased JAK2 expression and PRR-induced JAK2 activation and cytokine secretion.\n\nThe threshold of JAK2 signaling determines if NOD2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased or decreased\n\nThe decreased secretion of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines following acute NOD2 stimulation by the lower JAK2-expressing rs10758669 AA carrier MDMs (Fig. 5D) was surprising given that JAK2 knockdown resulted in increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 1). We hypothesized that these differences may reflect distinct outcomes based on the threshold of JAK2 expression and signaling. As such, if JAK2 expression or signaling falls below a particular threshold, NOD2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines would now increase due to greatly reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines. A partial JAK2 expression decrease as is observed in rs10758669 AA carriers could then modulate cytokines differently relative to the more dramatic reduction in JAK2 expression under the knockdown conditions assessed above. To address this hypothesis, we progressively decreased JAK2 expression in high JAK2-expressing rs10758669 CC MDMs through dose-dependent siRNA targeting (Fig. 6A). With mild JAK2 expression reduction, levels of NOD2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines progressively decreased (Fig. 6B). However, once JAK2 expression decreased to less than ~30% of the levels observed in CC carrier MDMs, NOD2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines stopped decreasing, and began to increase (Fig. 6B). In contrast, anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion progressively decreased through the full range of JAK2 expression reduction (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, side-by-side JAK2 expression knock-down in rs10758669 CC carrier MDMs to the levels observed in AA carrier cells (Fig. 6A) resulted in comparable cytokine secretion between the two genotypes (Fig. 6C). This highlights that at the levels of reduced JAK2 expression in rs10758669 AA non-risk carrier MDMs, JAK2 expression is above the threshold of reciprocal regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such that PRR-induced pro",

This highlights that at the levels of reduced JAK2 expression in rs10758669 AA non-risk carrier MDMs, JAK2 expression is above the threshold of reciprocal regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such that PRR-induced pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are both decreased. Taken together, with acute NOD2 stimulation, once JAK2 expression or signaling decreases below a threshold, proinflammatory cytokine secretion progressively increases.\n\nGiven that the threshold of JAK2 expression determines how pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion is regulated, we questioned how JAK inhibition affects cytokine regulation in the context of rs10758669 genotype. Such genotype:inhibitor dose interactions may have implications for JAK inhibitor therapy. At low levels of JAK2 (Fig. 6D) and JAK (tofacitinib, Supplementary Fig. 4B) inhibition, rs10758669 CC carrier MDMs demonstrated decreased NOD2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, with more potent JAK2 and JAK inhibition NOD2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines increased. In contrast, anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion decreased progressively with increasing JAK inhibition (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. 4B). Interestingly, at the lower 0.1 µM JAK2 inhibitor (SD-1029) or tofacitinib dose, NOD2-induced cytokine trends in rs10758669 CC and AA carrier MDMs were reversed. AA carriers expressed higher pro-inflammatory cytokines relative to CC carrier MDMs at that same inhibitor dose (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. 4B), and relative to non-JAK2 inhibitor treated AA MDMs, whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines from CC MDMs were still decreased relative to non-JAK2 inhibitor treated cells. Therefore, the lower JAK2-expressing rs10758669 AA MDMs switch from a decrease to an increase in PRR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines at a lower dose of JAK pharmacological inhibitor treatment than do rs10758669 CC MDMs. Taken together, pro-inflammatory cytokine regulation depends on the level of JAK2 expression and JAK signaling during acute NOD2 stimulation, and JAK inhibition leads to a ‘switch’ from decreased to increased inflammatory cytokines at lower inhibitor doses in the lower JAK2-expressing rs10758669 AA MDMs.\n\nMDMS from rs10758669 CC disease risk carrier ulcerative colitis risk patients demonstrate increased JAK2 expression, and increased NOD2-induced JAK2 phosphorylation and cytokine secretion relative to A allele carriers\n\nParalleling outcomes in healthy control MDMs, rs10758669 CC disease risk carrier cells from ulcerative colitis patients (Supplementary Figure 1A) showed increased JAK2 RNA and protein expression, and increased acute NOD2-induced JAK2 phosphorylation and secretion of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines relative to A carrier MDMs (Fig. 7A–D). MDMs from rs10758669 AA disease carriers similarly required a lower JAK2 inhibitor and tofacitinib dose to switch from decreased to increased NOD2-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines than did C carrier MDMs (Fig. 7E & F). Therefore, PRR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in MDMs is regulated in a JAK2 genotype-dependent manner in both healthy controls and ulcerative colitis patients.",

Energy Intake\n\nThe post-weaning energy intake was estimated based on the daily food and fluid intakes and the caloric values of rat chow (2.8 kcal/g, A03 formula purchased from Safe® (Safe Villemoisson-sur-Orge, France) and fructose (4 kcal/g), and did not differ between the Cit and Ala groups (Figure 2).\n\n3.2. Growth and Body Composition\n\nNo significant difference in body weight was observed between the groups, either during nursing or during fructose supplementation (Figure 3). Neither the fat mass nor the lean body mass differed between groups at the time of sacrifice (Table 1).\n\n3.3. Glucose Metabolism (Figure 4)\n\nDuring OGTT, the baseline blood glucose concentrations were comparable in both groups. Blood glucose rose higher in rats from the Cit group at 15 and 30 min after the glucose load, but returned to values indistinguishable from the Ala group at 60, 90, and 120 min; the area under the curve (AUC) did not differ between groups. The insulin sensitivity index, calculated from the blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations at 0 and 120 min, did not differ.\n\n3.4. Lipid Metabolism\n\nThe plasma TG and HDL cholesterol concentrations were similar in the two groups. In contrast, in adult rats that had received citrulline in early life, the liver TG concentration was higher (p < 0.01), whereas the total cholesterol level was lower (p < 0.001) than in rats that had received alanine (Figure 5). \n\nAccordingly, the transcription of liver Fas and Srebf1, two genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, was elevated, and the transcription of HMGc1, an enzyme involved in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, was lower in the citrulline group, compared with the alanine group (Figure 6). The expression of DGAT1, DGAT2, SCD1, MTTP, HMG-CoA reductase, ACC, CPT1m and CYP 7A1, did not differ between the groups (data not shown).\n\nAn exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) of the LC-MS lipidomics data was performed in positive and negative modes. The score plot of the first two PCs, which expressed almost 41% and 86% of the total variability for LC-MS profiles acquired in the positive (Figure 7A) and negative (Figure 7C) modes, respectively, showed a clear differentiation, particularly in the negative mode, between the Cit and Ala groups, reflected by a high goodness-of-fit and predictability, as indicated by an R2 value of 0.86 and by a Q2 value of 0.79, in the negative mode (Figure 7C). PLS-DA confirmed an equally good clustering of the samples with a high estimated goodness of prediction (Q2 around 85% and 99% for the first 2 components in the positive (Figure 7B) and negative (Figure 7D) mode, respectively, for the effect of early citrulline supplementation on adult lipodomic profiles (Figure 7B,C). The analysis of the corresponding loading plot revealed, among 1073 variables (i.e., (m/z; RT) features), 71 features that could be annotated with our home database, including 42 variables of importance for the clustering (VIP above 1.0) (Table 2). More specifically, among the 42 annotated VIP selected for the discrimination of Cit and Ala groups in PLS-DA, 16 VIP presented a significant mean discrepancy between the two groups, with specificities in several phospholipids (Table 2). Indeed, we observed a significant decrease in the Cit group in phosphatidylcholines containing saturated palmitic acid (i.e., PC (16:0/16:0) and PC (16:0/18:1)), but an increase in PC (18:2/20:3). In addition, the Cit group presented a significant enhancement in several phosphatidylethanolamines rich in arachidonic acid or its precursor, such as PE (16:0/20:4), PE (18:0/18:2), PE (18:0/20:4), and PE (18:2/20:4), but a trend towards a decrease in PE containing DHA as a fatty acid (i.e., PE (16:0/22:6), PE (18:0/22:6) and PE (18:1/22:6)). Furthermore, the Cit group had higher levels of hepatic phosphatidylinositol PI (16:0/18:2) and phosphatidylserine PS (18:0/20:4), but lower levels of one very long-chain sphingomyelin, SM (d18:1/24:1), and one long-chain ceramide, Cer (d(18:1/20:0), whereas no significant change was observed in the total triglycerides and diglycerides that could have been annotated, as compared with the Ala group (Table 2, Figure 7).",

    "content": "Results\n\nThe WGHS sample with BP data and genome-wide genotyping that was eligible for this investigation included 23,019 women of confirmed, self-reported European descent with mean age of 54 ± 7 years. The mean SBP was 125 ± 15 mmHg, DBP was 77 ± 10 mmHg, and 5,699 (25%) had a physician diagnosis of HTN at baseline. Thirteen percent were taking anti-hypertensive medications, 12% were smokers, and 44% were using hormone replacement therapy at baseline.\n\nReplication of GWA-derived SNPs\n\nReplication in the WGHS supported associations with 5 of 7 primary SNPs for SBP (5 of 6 SBP loci due to 2 SNPs within the same locus: SH2B3, ATP2B1, MTHFR, CYP17A1 [rs11191548 and rs1004467, pairwise r2 = 0.42], PLEKHA7) at the pre-specified P-value < 1.2 × 10−3. Similarly, 8 of 11 primary SNPs were associated with DBP in the WGHS (6 of 9 DBP loci, CACNB2, ATP2B1, CYP1A2-CSK-ULK3 [rs1378942 and rs6495122, r2 = 0.59], c10orf107, SH2B3 [rs653178 and rs3184504, r2 = 1.0], ZNF652) (Table 1). Among secondary SNPs, 2 of 8 SNPs were associated with SBP (CACNB2, CASZ1), and 1 of 5 with DBP (PLEKHA7) in the WGHS (Table 2). For beta coefficients, please see Supplemental Digital Content, Tables 1 and 2.\n\nThe association between candidate SNPs and BP was robust across different BP traits, as loci replicating with SBP in the WGHS also showed evidence of association with DBP, and vice versa. There was also significant association between 3 of 12 replicated primary, and 1 of 3 secondary SNPs with hypertension (Supplemental Digital Content, Table 3). Overall, the directional association (sign of beta) in the WGHS matched CHARGE or Global BPgen for 27 of 29 SNPs. Two secondary SNPs that were not associated with BP in WGHS had discordant beta coefficients compared with previous studies (rs13423988, P=0.39, and rs13401889, P=0.40).\n\nReplication of expression-associated SNPs\n\nFour of 12 loci selected for potential functional effects through their association with gene expression met replication thresholds for BP phenotypes within WGHS (Table 3). The validated eSNPs were rs7537765 (CLCN6 near MTHFR, NPPA; expressed gene CLCN6), rs6495126 (MPI, SCAMP2, ULK3; expressed genes ULK3, AK001918, RPP25), rs6601414 (MSRA; expressed gene C8orf5), and rs2898290 (BLK, GATA4; expressed genes C8orf5, FAM167A, BLK).\n\nMeta-analysis of WGHS results and prior studies\n\nTable 4 provides meta-analysis results combining WGHS data with prior study results (for beta coefficients please see Supplemental Digital Content, Table 4). For GWA-derived candidate SNPs, one new genome-wide association emerged for SBP (rs880315; CASZ1), a locus that recently replicated with genome-wide significance in the Japanese population. One additional association was suggestive with P = 9.1 × 10−8 (rs448378; MDS1). One locus previously associated with DBP emerged as newly genome-wide significant in association with SBP (CACNB2), and one locus previously associated with SBP emerged as newly significant in association with DBP (PLEKHA7). In meta-analysis of eSNP results, there were 3 loci that were associated with BP at P < 5.0 × 10−8: CLCN6-MTHFR-NPPA and ULK3 met genome-wide significance in prior studies, whereas the association at BLK-GATA4 was newly significant. Of note, the eSNP near ULK3 (rs6495126), and the GWA-derived SNP at ULK3 (rs6495122) are in modest linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.49), suggesting that SNP-SNP correlation may not fully explain this finding, and that rs6495126 may potentially represent a separate locus of interest. One additional locus was suggestive with P = 2.5 × 10−7 (SEC31A-SCD5).\n\nBlood pressure risk score\n\nWeighted genetic risk scores were evaluated for the association with the deviation of SBP and DBP from the mean, and the odds ratio for prevalent HTN (Figure 1). As expected, there was a dose-response relationship between increasing risk score and higher BP: the range of the SBP risk score was associated with a 6 mmHg spread in SBP, and the odds ratio of HTN ranged from 0.7 for individuals with a risk score < 5 (95% CI 0.4–1.0, P=0.03), to an odds ratio of 1.9 for a risk score > 11 (95% CI 1.4–2.4, P<0.0001) when compared to individuals with a median risk score of 8.

EA cases were more likely to have a first-degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer (P=0.001), but less likely to have a college or post-graduate degree (P<0.001) and to breastfeed (P=0.008), compared to EA controls. Among both cases and controls, AAs were more likely to be obese than EAs (52.1% vs 28.0% in cases, and 53.2% vs 27.0% in controls). For both EAs and AAs, cases were more likely to have history of benign breast disease (P=0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). For AA women, there were a higher proportion of current smokers in controls than cases (P<0.001). The categories of BMI, WHR, and weight gain from age 20 did not differ by case status in either racial group. Among those with known ER status of breast tumors, AA cases had a higher proportion of ER− tumors compared to EA cases (31.5% versus 17.2%).\n\nTable 2 lists associations of SNPs with breast cancer in either EA or AA women. In FRAP1, the variant A allele of rs12125777 was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer in EAs (ORGA/AA vs. GG=1.69, 95% CI=1.08–2.64; nominal P-trend=0.020; PACT=0.17), but not in AAs. In regulatory associated protein of mTOR complex 1 (RPTOR), two SNPs that potentially have regulatory functions were associated with breast cancer risk. The variant G allele of RPTOR rs9900506 (Regulome DB score=3a) was associated with a lower breast cancer risk in EA women (ORGG vs. AA=0.68, 95% CI=0.48–0.95; nominal P-trend=0.042; PACT=0.89), but not in AA women. However, the variant of RPTOR rs3817293 (Regulome DB score=2b) was associated with a lower breast cancer risk in AA women (ORAA/GA vs. GG =0.79, 95% CI=0.63–0.99; nominal P-trend=0.044; PACT=0.97), but not in EA women. Among the other tagSNPs, the variant allele of rs7713645 in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in AA women (ORCC vs. AA=0.56, 95% CI=0.33–0.97; PACT=0.041), while proline rich 5 like (PRR5L) rs3740958 was associated with a higher risk in EA women (ORGG/GA vs. AA=1.71, 95% CI=1.29–2.27 for; PACT=0.005). In addition, CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1) rs9368197 was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer in EA women (ORAA vs. CC=1.66, 95% CI=1.08–2.54; nominal P-trend 0.032; PACT was not applicable because only one SNP was genotyped in this gene). The increased risk was mainly driven by the increase in risk of ER+ tumors, and not of ER− tumors (P-heterogeneity=0.021; Supplementary Table 2). However, the association was reversed in AA women (ORAA/AC vs. CC=0.70, 95% CI=0.51–0.97; nominal P-trend=0.015). The associations with overall breast cancer were significantly different between EA and AA women for PRR5L rs3740958 and CDKAL1 rs9368197 (P-interaction of SNP and race <0.001 and 0.005, respectively)\n\nAmong these SNPs associated with breast cancer risk, significant effect modification of BMI and weight gain was observed for FRAP1 rs12125777 in EA women (Table 3). Our data showed that among EA women, the association of GA/AA vs. GG genotypes and breast cancer risk was stronger among overweight women (25 ≤BMI <30; OR=2.37, 95% CI=0.91–6.13) and obese women (BMI ≥30; OR=7.69, 95% CI=2.11–28.0), compared to normal/underweight women (BMI <25; OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.45–1.61; p-interaction = 0.007). The 95% CIs, however, were wide due to a small number of cases in women with the rare allele. A similar pattern of effect modification was also observed for weight gain since age 20. The association for those carrying the variant A allele of rs12125777 was strengthened among EA women who gained 35 lbs. or more since age 20 (OR=3.34, 95% CI=1.42–7.85), compared to the associations among those with lesser weight gain (P-interaction=0.021).

High carbohydrate diet increases and lipid emulsion attenuates the expression of PNPLA3 in mouse liver\n\nWe first analyzed how a lipogenic diet affects the expression of PNPLA3 in liver of intact mice. Compared to the group fed a stock diet (normal chow, NC), PNPLA3 mRNA was increased 7-fold in the liver of mice fed HC diet (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the inclusion of LE in the HC diet, either as HC-4% LE diet or as HC-13.5% LE diet, prevented the induction of PNPLA3 mRNA dose-dependently (Fig. 1A). Results from western blotting showed that similar changes were evident for PNPLA3 protein (Fig. 1B). Liver total TG content was significantly correlated with PNPLA3 mRNA levels in mice fed HC diet, either with or without LE (Fig. 1C).\n\n3.2. PNPLA3 is correlated with SREBP1c and ACC-1 in mouse liver\n\nTo determine if a similar pattern existed for other genes that are important in the lipogenic pathway, we also examined expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1c), a key transcriptional factor that regulates many genes involved in lipid metabolism, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-1), which is responsible for formation of malonyl-CoA in the process of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Both SREBP1c (Fig. 2A) and ACC-1 (Fig. 2B) showed a similar expression pattern to that of PNPLA3. We observed a correlation between PNPLA3 mRNA and SREBP1c mRNA (Fig. 2C; R2 =0.62; P<0.0001) and ACC-1 mRNA (Fig. 2D; R2 =0.84; P<0.0001). SREBP1c mRNA was also correlated with ACC-1 mRNA (Fig. 2E; R2 =0.85; P<0.0001). By contrast, PNPLA2 (ATGL), which can break down TG, did not differ among diets (Supplementary Fig. 1A). We also measured PNPLA3 gene expression in mouse epididymal tissue. PNPLA3 was not different among diet groups in this tissue (Supplementary Fig. 1B), although, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1C, PNPLA3 expression is highly expressed in murine adipose tissue.\n\n3.3. Hepatic PNPLA3 expression is not elevated in the liver of mice fed HF diet but is suppressed by exercise\n\nNext, we studied how high-fat feeding and physical activity may affect the expression of PNPLA3. In study 2, mice fed HF diet developed fatty liver indicated by the increased level of hepatic TG (Fig. 3A). This increase was attenuated by exercise (Fig. 3A). PNPLA3 expression was not elevated in mice with HF-induced fatty liver, compared to mice fed LF diet (Fig. 3B). Strikingly, voluntary exercise reduced PNPLA3 mRNA levels by 10-fold compared to the LF and HF diet groups (Fig. 3B). The mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Fig. 3C) and SREPB1c (Fig. 3D) did not differ between LF and HF diet groups. By contrast, ACC-1 was lower in the HF compared to the LF diet group (Fig. 3E). Moreover, exercise significantly suppressed both SREBP1c and ACC-1 gene expression (Fig. 3D and E).\n\n3.4. PNPLA3 gene expression was regulated by glucose in HepG2 cells\n\nWe investigated PNPLA3 and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) gene expression in HepG2 cells exposed to “depletion-re-feeding conditions” in which cells were cycled between no glucose (depletion), low, and high glucose media. PNPLA3 gene expression was reduced after 8 h of depletion (P < 0.05), while the level returned to base line 8 h after high glucose refeeding (Fig. 4A). After this, reduction in glucose resulted in a moderate reduction in expression, while high glucose for 8 to 24 h increased the level of expression, which, subsequently, was again completely abrogated after 16 h of starvation. ChREBP exhibited a similar pattern of expression to that of PNPLA3 (Fig. 4B), and correlation analysis showed that PNPLA3 mRNA levels were highly significantly correlated with ChREBP mRNA levels (Fig. 4C).\n\n3.5. PNPLA3 gene expression varies in response to glycolytic intermediates in HepG2 cells\n\nA series of experiments were conducted to determine whether metabolism of glucose was essential for induction of PNPLA3, and whether a specific glycolytic intermediate could be responsible for regulating PNPLA3 expression. These results showed that treatment with the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, did not induce PNPLA3 expression (Fig. 5A). Similarly, SREBP1c gene expression was induced two-fold by high glucose compared to low glucose, but suppressed by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (Fig 5B). Oil Red O staining showed that high glucose resulted in increased lipid accumulation, whereas 2-deoxy-D-glucose led to reduction of lipid content in cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B). Incubation with citrate, a Krebs cycle intermediate downstream of glucose metabolism, increased PNPLA3 levels, whereas pyruvate and acetate were ineffective (Fig. 5C",

Incubation with citrate, a Krebs cycle intermediate downstream of glucose metabolism, increased PNPLA3 levels, whereas pyruvate and acetate were ineffective (Fig. 5C). Expression patterns of FAS and ACC-1 were similar to that of PNPLA3 (Fig. 5D and E). In order to examine the specificity of PNPLA3 to citrate, cells were treated with the isomer isocitrate. The result showed that PNPLA3 was not regulated by isocitrate.\n\n3.6. PNPLA3 gene does not response to insulin and glucagon in HepG2 cells\n\nStudies conducted with 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human adipose tissue have shown that PNPLA3 gene expression is regulated by insulin. In addition, one study showed that insulin increased promoter activity of PNPLA3 gene expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Therefore, we examined whether hepatic PNPLA3 is regulated by insulin in HepG2 cells, which express the insulin receptor protein. Incubation of HepG2 cells with 10 nM insulin for 24 h did not increase PNPLA3 mRNA compare to control cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A). By contrast, the same treatment induced the expression of FAS, a known target of insulin action, by 2-fold (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). Taken together, these data suggest that hepatic PNPLA3 does not response to insulin stimulation in HepG2 human hepatocytes. Because our in vivo data showed that exercise suppressed PNPLA3 expression, we hypothesized that exercise may stimulate glucagon secretion, and thereby decrease PNPLA3 gene expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 100 nM glucagon in low (5.5 mM) glucose medium for 24 hours had no effect on PNPLA3 mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. 3C), whereas glucagon stimulated the expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), a known target of glucagon action (Supplementary Fig. 3D).\n\n3.7. PNPLA3 gene expression is reduced in HepG2 cells by several unsaturated fatty acids\n\nThe major fatty acid components of the LE we employed, Intralipid®, are linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA), and α-linolenic acid (ALA). Since the results of our studies demonstrated that Intralipid completely reversed the induction of PNPLA3 by HC-diet in mouse liver (Fig. 1), we investigated whether certain types of fatty acids affect PNPLA3 gene expression when added directly to HepG2 cells. Interestingly, treatment with either 400 μM OA (Fig. 6A) or LA (Fig. 6B) suppressed PNPLA3 gene expression in both low glucose and high glucose conditions. By contrast, ALA had no effect on PNPLA3 gene expression under either condition (Fig. 6C). We further explored the effects of two long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on PNPLA3 gene expression. Both EPA and DHA suppressed PNPLA3 gene expression under both low and high glucose conditions (Fig. 6D). Moreover, the combination of OA, LA, and ALA (ratio: 6:3:1) significantly suppressed gene expression of PNPLA3 (Fig. 6E), SREBP1c (Fig. 6F), and FAS (Fig. 6G) in both low glucose and high glucose conditions. All of these fatty acids resulted in lipid accumulation as measured by Oil Red O staining (Supplementary Fig. 2A and C).\n\n3.8. PNPLA3 knockdown did not prevent lipid accumulation but increased FAS expression\n\nSince PNPLA3 gene expression is regulated by nutritional signals and our data had implicated PNPLA3 as a lipogenic signal, we investigated whether the knockdown of PNPLA3 in HepG2 cells affects glucose or lipid metabolism. Cells transfected with scrambled siRNA as a non-targeting control were compared to cells transfected with PNPLA3-specific siRNA. Transfection with PNPLA3 siRNA decreased PNPLA3 mRNA and protein by ~65% and ~70%, respectively in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7A, B and C). However, Oil Red O staining showed no difference between cells with knocked down PNPLA3 and controls under either low or high glucose conditions (Fig. 7E). PNPLA3 knockdown also had no effect on lipid content when cells were incubated with exogenous fatty acid (OA) (Fig. 7E). Interestingly, we found that FAS mRNA was increased approximately 2 fold in PNPLA3 siRNA-treated cells compared to control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 7D). By contrast, knockdown of FAS using a strategy similar to that used for PNPLA3 had no effect on the level of PNPLA3 expression (data not shown).",

All of the subjects had fatty liver as defined by an HFF% >5.5%; median HFF% was 14.7% (IQR: 9.10%–22.8%) and median plasma ALT was 33.0 U/L (IQR: 10.0–54.0 U/L). During the study, the mean weight remained stable by study design (Supplemental Figure 2) and there were no statistically significant changes in visceral or subcutaneous abdominal fat, or the visceral/subcutaneous abdominal fat ratio (P > 0.05) (Table 1).\n\nDietary compliance\n\nThe dietitian obtained completed simplified food records from each participant to assess percentage compliance for each week. Of the 17 participants who completed the dietary intervention, 15 participants were compliant (median compliance for the 12-wk intervention: 92.0%; IQR: 87.2%–94.7%). For measures of plasma OXLAM concentrations, there was a significant progressive decline in 9-HODE, 13-HODE, and 9-oxoODE concentrations in the cohort over the 12-wk intervention (P < 0.05) (Supplemental Figure 3). Although there was no clear trend in the plasma concentrations of n–3 PUFAs in the cohort, there was a significant increase in DHA over the 12-wk intervention (P = 0.002) (Supplemental Figure 4).\n\nPhysical activity compliance\n\nNo participant reported the initiation of an exercise regimen or an increase in physical activity. Participants were sedentary at week 0 and throughout the duration of the intervention, and no participants engaged in vigorous daily activity.\n\nSmoking and alcohol compliance\n\nQuestionnaires on smoking and alcohol usage collected at week 0 and week 12 indicated that participants were not smoking or drinking alcohol at the start of the study, as well as throughout the 12-wk intervention.\n\nChanges in liver-related outcomes\n\nIn Figure 1A, we show individual changes in HFF% from before (week 0) to after (week 12) 12 wk of dietary intervention. Median HFF% decreased in the entire group by 25.8% (P = 0.009), from 14.7% (IQR: 9.10%–22.8%) at week 0 to 9.70% (IQR: 2.80%–22.4%) at week 12. Among the 14 participants who reduced HFF% by week 12 of the diet intervention, the median HFF% at week 0 was 12.3% (IQR: 9.00%–18.2%) and the median HFF% at week 12 was 7.15% (IQR: 1.78%–12.1%). Of them, 6 subjects reverted to the normal range, as defined by HFF% <5.5%, in whom the median HFF% at week 0 was 8.90% (IQR: 8.43%–10.6%) and the median HFF% at week 12 was 1.56% (IQR: 0.00%–3.95%). Three subjects showed no change or an increase in HFF% after the diet intervention, in whom the median HFF% at week 0 was 17.8% (IQR: 15.9%–30.9%) and the median HFF% at week 12 was 24.4% (IQR: 20.3%–32.6%). At the end of the 12-wk intervention, a significant drop in median plasma ALT concentrations (P = 0.001) was also observed in the overall cohort (week 0: 33.0 IU/L; IQR: 10.0–54.0 IU/L; week 12: 19.0 IU/L; IQR: 5.00–33.0 IU/L) (Figure 1B).\n\nChanges in glucose- and lipid metabolism–related outcomes\n\nAfter the intervention, there was a 21.9% reduction of median plasma triglyceride concentrations (week 0: 130 mg/dL; IQR: 89.5–236 mg/dL; week 12: 104 mg/dL; IQR: 76.0–155 mg/dL; P = 0.046) (Figure 1C) and a statistical trend toward a reduction of plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol (week 0: 80.0 mg/dL; IQR: 75.5–96.5 mg/dL; week 12: 83.0 mg/dL; IQR: 68.4–90.0 mg/dL; P = 0.071) (Figure 1D). The OGTT glycemic responses at week 0 and at week 12 of the intervention were nearly superimposable (P = 0.207) (Figure 2A); however, OGTT plasma insulin concentrations significantly decreased in the cohort at the end of the intervention (P = 0.045) (Figure 2B). Supplemental Figure 5 shows the total AUCs for OGTT plasma glucose and insulin concentrations at week 0 and week 12 for each subject. Of the 4 subjects that presented with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) at the beginning of the study, 2 subjects reverted to normal glucose tolerance, 1 subject remained with IGT,",

Of the 4 subjects that presented with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) at the beginning of the study, 2 subjects reverted to normal glucose tolerance, 1 subject remained with IGT, and 1 subject progressed to type 2 diabetes by the end of the dietary intervention (HFF% at week 0: 15.9%; HFF% at week 12: 20.3%) (Figure 2C, D).\n\nChanges in n–3 PUFAs and oxidized fatty acids derived from LA (OXLAMs)\n\nWhereas there were no overall changes in the plasma concentrations of LA and AA (P > 0.05) (Supplemental Figure 6), there was a significant progressive decline in plasma concentrations of 9-HODE, 13-HODE, and 9-oxoODE (P < 0.05) and a trend toward a reduction in plasma concentrations of 13-oxoODE (P = 0.053) over the 12-wk intervention (Supplemental Figure 3). For n–3 PUFAs, the plasma concentration of DHA increased significantly (P = 0.002) and there was a trend toward a rise in plasma concentrations of EPA (P = 0.052) over the 12-wk dietary intervention (Supplemental Figure 4).\n\nChanges in liver-related outcomes by PNPLA3 rs738409 genotype\n\nOf the 17 participants, 8 were homozygous for the PNPLA3 rs738409 risk allele (GG), 4 were heterozygous (CG), and 5 subjects were homozygous for the major allele (CC). The CC/CG (3 male, 6 female) and GG (3 male, 5 female) groups had similar age, BMI, and HFF% at week 0 (P > 0.05). Notably, in contrast to the CC/CG group, subjects homozygous for the G allele displayed a significant change in HFF% (P = 0.016) (Figure 3A) and plasma triglycerides (P = 0.016) (Figure 3B) and a trend toward a reduction in plasma ALT (P = 0.055) (Figure 3C) concentrations at the end of the intervention. In Supplemental Figure 7, we show HFF% at week 0 and week 12 stratified by each genotype (CC, CG, GG). Over the 12-wk intervention, OXLAMs decreased in both genotype groups. A significant decline with respect to genotype was found in the OXLAMs 9-HODE (P = 0.023), 9-oxoODE (P = 0.009), and 13-oxoODE (P = 0.003) (Supplemental Figure 8). Plasma concentrations of ALA, EPA, DPA, and DHA (n–3 PUFAs) did not change in a clear pattern during the intervention and were not significantly different among genotypes (P > 0.05) (Supplemental Figure 9). In Supplemental Table 1A, we show week 0 and week 12 characteristics and study outcomes by genotype group and in Supplemental Table 1B, we show mean percentage change from week 0 to week 12 for characteristics and study outcomes by genotype group.",

    "content": "Results\n\nIslet chromatin accessibility and 3D chromatin architecture\n\nWe first defined islet accessible chromatin using ATAC-seq generated from four pancreatic islet samples (Supplementary Table 1). We called sites for each sample separately using MACS2, and merged sites to create a combined set of 105,734 islet accessible chromatin sites. We observed strong correlation in both accessible chromatin signal and peak calls across samples (Supplementary Fig. 1a), as well as concordance with peak calls from the majority of published ATAC-seq data from 19 islet samples and FACS-sorted beta and alpha cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). We collected previously published ChIP-seq data of histone modification and transcription factor binding in primary islets from two studies and utilized these data to call chromatin states with ChromHMM (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Accessible chromatin predominantly mapped within active enhancer (EnhA1) and promoter (TssA) states (Fig. 1a). We functionally annotated islet accessible chromatin peaks using chromatin states to define active enhancers and promoters, as well as other classes of islet accessible chromatin (Supplementary Data 1). We identified 44,860 active enhancers which, in line with previous reports, were distal to promoters (Supplementary Fig. 1e), more tissue-specific (Supplementary Fig. 1f), overlapped islet transcription factor ChIP-seq sites (Supplementary Fig. 1g), and preferentially harbored sequence motifs for FOXA, RFX, NEUROD, and other islet transcription factors (Supplementary Data 2). These results define active enhancers and other classes of accessible chromatin in pancreatic islets.\n\nDefining the target genes of enhancers has been challenging as they frequently control non-adjacent genes over large genomic distances through chromatin looping. To address this, we created a map of 3D chromatin architecture in pancreatic islets at sufficient resolution to identify chromatin loops. We performed genome-wide chromatin conformation capture using in situ Hi-C in three islet samples, two of which were sequenced to a depth of >1 billion reads (Supplementary Table 1). Contact matrices from islet Hi-C assays were strongly correlated across samples (Spearman ρ > 0.80) (Supplementary Fig. 2a). We called chromatin loops at 5, 10, and 25 kb resolution with HICCUPS using reads from each sample individually, as well as with reads pooled from all three samples (Fig. 1b). We merged the resulting four sets of loop calls where both anchors overlapped at 20 kb resolution (see Methods) to create a combined set of 11,924 islet Hi-C loops (Supplementary Data 3). The median distance between loop anchor midpoints was 255 kb, and nearly 10% were over 1 Mb in size (Supplementary Fig. 2b). This established a map of chromatin loops in human pancreatic islets.\n\nWe next determined the relationship between islet accessible chromatin and chromatin looping. Islet accessible chromatin signal was largely localized to islet loop anchors, with the strongest signal at anchor midpoints (Fig. 1c). Nearly half (48.7%) of all islet accessible chromatin sites were within 25 kb of an anchor, and 16.8% directly overlapped an anchor. Sites most enriched (empirical P < 1.5 × 10−4) for direct overlap with chromatin loop anchors were those in a CTCF-binding state (7.5-fold), followed by active promoter (TssA: 3.9-fold; TssFlnk: 3.3-fold), and active enhancer (EnhA1: 2.4-fold) states (Fig. 1d). We further mapped the relationship between pairs of islet accessible chromatin sites directly connected by loop anchors (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The most significantly enriched anchor interactions were between active enhancer and promoter states (EnhA1-TssA OR = 1.28, Fisher’s exact P = 1.53 × 10−37; EnhA1-EnhA1 OR = 1.37, P = 1.87 × 10−38; TssA-TssA OR = 1.42, P = 6.15 × 10−36). We also observed strong enrichment for interactions between sites within the CTCF-binding state (CTCF-CTCF OR = 1.16; Fisher’s exact P = 1.1 × 10−17) (Fig. 1e). These results demonstrate that islet chromatin loops are prominently enriched for CTCF binding, as well as active promoter and enhancer regions.\n\nEnhancer loops and islet-specific gene expression\n\nWe next used chromatin loops to annotate candidate relationships between distal islet enhancers and their potential target genes genome-wide (see Methods). We identified 6278 islet active enhancers that mapped directly in a chromatin loop anchor and, of these, 3022 enhancers were in a loop to a gene promoter (Supplementary Fig. 2d and Supplementary Data 4). Conversely, the promoter regions of 2028 genes had at least one direct loop to an active enhancer element (Supplementary Fig. 2e and Supplementary Data 5). Of these 2028 genes, 952 (47%) had chromatin loops to multiple active enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Genes directly looped to multiple enhancers were enriched for processes related to transcription factor",

Conversely, the promoter regions of 2028 genes had at least one direct loop to an active enhancer element (Supplementary Fig. 2e and Supplementary Data 5). Of these 2028 genes, 952 (47%) had chromatin loops to multiple active enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Genes directly looped to multiple enhancers were enriched for processes related to transcription factor activity and gene regulation, signaling and stimulus response, protein transport and insulin signaling (Supplementary Table 2), and also included genes critical for islet function such as ISL1, FOXA2, NKX6.1, and MAFB (Supplementary Data 5). At many loci enhancers looped to gene promoters over long distances; the average distance between interacting enhancer and gene promoter pairs was 165 kb, with 13.9% (532) over 500 kb and 3.6% (138) over 1 Mb (Fig. 2a). For example, there were four chromatin loops at the MAFB locus, including two direct loops between enhancers and the MAFB promoter region over 1 Mb distal (Fig. 2b). These results define candidate target genes for thousands of distal enhancer elements in islets.\n\nWe examined the relationship between active enhancer looping and target gene expression. We compared our map of islet enhancer candidate target genes defined from islet chromatin loops to gene expression levels in independent RNA-seq data from pancreatic islet samples and 53 tissues in GTEx release v7 data. A significantly higher proportion of genes expressed in islets had at least one enhancer loop compared to non-islet expressed genes (ln(TPM) >1; expr = 0.13, non-expr = 0.05, χ2 P < 2.2 × 10−16). Genes with increasing numbers of enhancer loops had, on average, higher expression level in islets (Spearman ρ = 0.13, P < 2.2 × 10−16), with the highest expression among genes with six or more loops (median = 19.1 TPM) (Fig. 2c). We measured the relative expression level of genes in islets and 53 GTEx tissues normalized across tissues (see Methods), and again observed a significant relationship between enhancer loops and relative islet expression level (Spearman ρ = 0.084, P < 2.2 × 10−16) (Fig. 2d). In addition, the number of islet enhancer interactions was a significant predictor of higher relative gene expression level in islets (linear regression β = 0.14, P < 2.2 × 10−16) but not of relative expression level in the 53 other tissues (Fig. 2d). We observed similar correlations between distal enhancers and islet gene expression when considering sites within a 25 kb region around each loop anchor, suggesting that these relationships extend beyond anchor boundaries (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g). These results suggest that distal islet enhancer chromatin loops are correlated with islet-specific gene expression patterns.\n\nWe next determined the effects of genetic variants in islet enhancers on target gene regulation. We generated expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data from 230 islet RNA-seq samples by combining summary statistics from two published studies through meta-analysis (see Methods). We identified variants overlapping classes of islet regulatory elements genome-wide. We then quantified the eQTL association of these variants to target genes determined by their proximity to nearby genes and from chromatin loops (see Methods). As expected, we observed the strongest eQTL evidence for active promoter and enhancer variants proximal to genes (TssA: median –log10(P) = 0.64; EnhA proximal: median –log10(P) = 0.50) (Fig. 2e). For variants in distal enhancers, we observed significantly stronger evidence for islet eQTL association with genes in direct loops to the enhancer relative to non-loop genes (EnhA loop median = 0.35, EnhA non-loop median = 0.32, Wilcox P = 4.4 × 10−5), even when matching based on gene distance to the enhancer (EnhA non-loop matched, Wilcox P = 0.022) (Fig. 2e). We observed similar eQTL enrichment among enhancer variants looped to gene promoters when considering sites within 25 kb of a loop anchor (Supplementary Fig. 2h). These results suggest that genetic variants in distal islet enhancer elements are preferentially correlated with the expression level of genes in chromatin loops.\n\nFine-mapped T2D risk signals affect islet enhancer activity\n\nGenetic variants in islet regulatory elements are enriched for T2D risk. The effects of variants in regulatory elements on T2D risk in the context of chromatin looping, however, are unknown. We determined the effects of variants in islet regulatory elements and chromatin loops on T2D risk using association data of 6.1 M common (MAF > 0.05) variants from the DIAGRAM consortium with fgwas and LD-score regression. We observed strongest enrichment of variants in active regulatory elements, most notably in active enhancers (EnhA1 fgwas ln(enrich) = 3.9, LD-score Z = 3.1) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3a). The effects of variants in active enhancer and promoter elements on T2D risk were more pronounced among",

We observed strongest enrichment of variants in active regulatory elements, most notably in active enhancers (EnhA1 fgwas ln(enrich) = 3.9, LD-score Z = 3.1) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3a). The effects of variants in active enhancer and promoter elements on T2D risk were more pronounced among those in chromatin loops (EnhA1 fgwas ln(enrich) = 4.38, LD-score Z = 3.1; TssA fgwas ln(enrich) = 3.03, LD-score Z = 0.86) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Conversely, variants in other islet elements such as flanking promoters and weak enhancers were more enriched outside of loops (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). To determine the inter-dependence of these effects, we jointly modeled variants in islet regulatory elements on T2D risk, while also including variants in GENCODE coding exons and UTRs. In a joint model, we observed enrichment of variants in islet active enhancer elements (EnhA1 ln(enrich) = 4.04), in addition to flanking promoters (TssFlnk ln(enrich) = 3.77) and coding exons (CDS ln(enrich) = 2.34) (Supplementary Fig. 3b). These results demonstrate genome-wide enrichment of variants in islet active regulatory elements within chromatin loops for T2D risk.\n\nTo identify T2D risk signals mapping in islet enhancers, we used the effects from the joint enrichment model as priors on the causal evidence (posterior probability of association; PPA) for variants at both known T2D loci and genome-wide (Supplementary Data 6, see Methods). Among 107 known risk signals, variants in islet enhancers accounted for almost a third (29%) of the total probability mass (Fig. 3c). We clustered known risk signals based on annotations at candidate causal variants (see Methods) and identified 30 signals where the causal variant was likely in an islet enhancer (Fig. 3d). The 30 T2D islet enhancer signals were associated with IGTT-based insulin secretion phenotypes significantly more than un-annotated signals (Enh. = 42%, un-annot. = 17%, Chi-square P = 1 × 10−7), supporting a role in islet function (see Methods, Fig. 3e). Fine-mapping including functional priors improved causal variant resolution at these 30 signals, which on average had 3.5 candidate variants overlapping an islet enhancer and an ATAC-seq site from >1 sample (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Data 1, and Supplementary Data 7). The majority of these enhancers were highly reproducible (>50% of samples), active in beta and alpha cells, in low-methylated regions (LMRs), and bound by islet TFs (Supplementary Data 7). At six signals we resolved a single causal enhancer variant, for example rs7732130 (PPA = 98%) at the 5q13 locus near ZBED3/PDE8B (Fig. 3g). Outside of known loci, we identified an additional 127 loci genome-wide where fine-mapping identified a putative T2D risk variant that overlapped an islet enhancer and ATAC-seq site from >1 sample (Supplementary Fig. 3c, Supplementary Data 1, and Supplementary Data 8; see Methods). These results identify known and putative T2D risk signals with causal variants in islet enhancers.\n\nWe next determined allelic effects of variants at these T2D signals on islet enhancer activity. We performed allelic imbalance mapping of enhancer variants using data from 23 islet ATAC-seq samples (four in this study, and 19 from published studies) and three islet Hi-C samples (see Methods). At the 30 T2D enhancer signals, we identified 24 variants with significant allelic imbalance (binomial test; FDR q < 0.1) in islet accessible chromatin (median = 1/signal) (Supplementary Data 7). Supporting the function of these variants, we observed significant evidence for concordant direction of effect on allelic imbalance in islet chromatin conformation (binomial P = 0.022) and the majority (19/24) were predicted to disrupt a TF footprint (Supplementary Data 7). Among putative T2D loci, we identified 20 additional variants with significant allelic imbalance (FDR < 0.1) (Supplementary Data 8). T2D variants with significant imbalance included five with previously reported islet regulatory effects such as rs11257655 at 10p13 (binomial P = 9.1 × 10−7), rs11708067 at 3q21 (binomial P = 2.1 × 10−8) and rs10842991 at 12p11 (binomial P = 2.6 × 10−4); the former two have also been reported to affect DNA methylation.

We validated that the risk allele at rs7732130 increased islet enhancer activity using gene reporter assays in islet cells (t-test Fwd P = 3.7 × 10−3, Rev P = 6.8 × 10−6) (Fig. 3h). These results identify T2D risk variants with allelic effects on islet enhancer activity.\n\nCandidate targets of T2D variants affecting islet enhancers\n\nWhile a large percentage of T2D risk signals affect islet enhancer activity, the gene targets of these enhancers are unknown. In order to identify genes affected by T2D risk variants in enhancers, we used a tiered strategy whereby we first identified candidate target genes of these enhancers using chromatin looping and promoter-proximity, and then further prioritized candidate genes cis-regulated by T2D enhancer variants using eQTL mapping. For each T2D enhancer signal (from Fig. 3d), we identified candidate genes based on whether an enhancer variant was within 25 kb of either a chromatin loop to the gene promoter or the gene promoter itself (see Methods). Based on this definition T2D enhancer signals had on average 2 candidate target genes (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Table 3), a large reduction in candidates compared to using a 1 MB window (median = 18 genes) or topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries (median = 7 genes) around candidate variants (Fig. 4a). At several loci, loops implicated candidate target genes highly distal (>500 kb) to T2D enhancer variants. For example, at the 3q27 locus T2D variants directly looped to the TPRG1 promoter 900 kb distal (Supplementary Fig. 4a), and at the 10p13 locus T2D variants looped to the OPTN and CCDC3 promoters 840 kb distal (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In additional examples, T2D enhancer variants at the 11p15 locus near KCNQ1 looped to the CDKN1C promoter as well as to the INS/IGF2 locus 700 kb distal (Supplementary Fig. 4c), and T2D enhancer variants at the 10q22 locus near ZMIZ1 looped to the POLR3A locus 1 MB distal (Supplementary Fig. 4d). These results define candidate target genes of T2D enhancer signals, including multiple that interact over large genomic distances.\n\nWe next mapped candidate target genes regulated by variants at T2D enhancer signals using islet eQTL data. At each signal, we tested the most likely casual enhancer variant for eQTL association to each candidate gene correcting for the total number of candidate genes for that signal (see Methods). For the resulting genes with eQTL evidence (corrected P < 0.05), we further confirmed the eQTL and T2D signals did not have distinct causal variants using Bayesian co-localization (see Methods). Target genes showed evidence for islet eQTLs with eight known T2D islet enhancer signals (corrected P < 0.05), including CAMK1D, ABCB9, C2CD4B, and IGF2BP2 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4). For example, the known T2D variant rs11257655 mapped in an islet active enhancer element that looped directly to the CAMK1D promoter and was an islet eQTL for CAMK1D expression (Fig. 4c). At the 127 putative T2D enhancer signals, we identified 12 additional target genes with evidence for eQTLs to T2D variants (corrected P < 0.05) such as FADS1, VEGFA, SNX32, and SCRN2 (Supplementary Table 4). Among these 21 cis-regulated genes, nearly a third have not been identified as significant islet eQTLs in previous studies. These results identify candidate target genes, which are cis-regulated by T2D islet enhancer signals.\n\nWe next characterized the biological functions of candidate genes identified at these T2D enhancer signals. Candidate target genes were strongly enriched in gene sets related to protein transport and secretion, potassium ion transport, vesicles and vesicle membranes, and endoplasmic reticulum (FDR q < 0.2) (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 5). Candidate target genes also included six genes involved in MODY and other monogenic and syndromic forms of diabetes (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GCK, INS, GLIS3, WFS1) (Supplementary Table 3). Conversely, non-target genes within 1 Mb of these same 30 signals were enriched for gene sets related to stress–response and other processes (FDR q < 0.2), which may represent regulatory programs activated in other cellular states (Supplementary Table 5, see Methods).

Conversely, non-target genes within 1 Mb of these same 30 signals were enriched for gene sets related to stress–response and other processes (FDR q < 0.2), which may represent regulatory programs activated in other cellular states (Supplementary Table 5, see Methods). Candidate genes with islet eQTLs to known and putative T2D enhancer signals were specifically enriched for genes involved in vesicle-mediated transport (FDR q < 0.2) (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 5). These results demonstrate that candidate target genes of T2D enhancer signals are involved in protein transport and secretion pathways.\n\nImp2 conditional inactivation affects insulin secretion\n\nAt the 3q27 locus, IGF2BP2 is the only candidate target gene based on T2D variant proximity to the gene promoter and eQTL evidence (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 4), and is furthermore the only gene in the entire TAD (Supplementary Fig. 5a and Supplementary Data 9). We sought to determine the mechanism of risk variant activity in islets at this locus. Fine-mapped T2D enhancer variants at 3q27 all mapped within a 6 kb intronic region proximal to the IGF2BP2 promoter (Supplementary Fig. 5a and Supplementary Data 7). We tested these candidate enhancer variants for allelic imbalance in islet accessible chromatin (see Methods). We observed significant evidence (FDR q < 0.1) for allelic imbalance at rs10428126 (binomial P = .001) where the T2D risk (and alternate) allele C had reduced accessibility, and no evidence for imbalance among the other candidate variants at this locus (Supplementary Data 7). This variant has also been reported as a chromatin accessibility QTL in islets. We further validated that the T2D risk allele at rs10428126 reduced islet enhancer activity using gene reporter assays in MIN6 cells (t-test P = 1.0 × 10−3) (Supplementary Fig. 5b). In addition, rs10428126 mapped in a site consistently active across ATAC-seq samples and in ChIP-seq sites for NKX2.2 and PDX1, and the risk allele disrupted PDX1 and NKX motifs (Supplementary Fig. 5c). These results reveal a likely causal risk variant at IGF2BP2 that reduces chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity in islets.\n\nAs T2D risk alleles at the IGF2BP2 locus are correlated with reduced islet chromatin accessibility, enhancer activity and IGF2BP2 expression as well as reduced insulin secretion phenotypes, we hypothesized that reduced activity of IGFBP2 would contribute to a diabetic phenotype in islets. We thus determined the effects of reduced IGF2BP2 (Imp2 in mice) on islet function using a mouse model. Imp2 is widely expressed in adult mouse tissues, including fat, muscle, liver, and pancreas, and in the pancreas Imp2 expression localized to islets and overlapped insulin (Fig. 5a). We inactivated Imp2 in mouse beta cells by recombining the Imp2flox(f) allele with Cre recombinase driven by the rat insulin 2 promoter (RIP2-Cre) (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Immunoblot analysis of extracts from isolated Imp2ff/RIP2-Cre islets confirmed reduced Imp2 abundance compared to Imp2ff islets (Fig. 5b). Imp2ff/RIP2-Cre mice exhibited no overt phenotype and gained weight similar to Imp2ff controls on both a normal chow (NCD) and high-fat diet (HFD) (Supplementary Fig. 6b).\n\nWe assessed the effect of Imp2 deficiency in mouse beta cells on glucose homeostasis. At 10 weeks of age, Imp2ff and Imp2ff/RIP2-Cre mice on NCD exhibited no difference in blood glucose and insulin levels. By contrast, blood insulin and C-peptide levels were reduced in HFD-fed Imp2ff/RIP2-Cre compared to HFD-fed control mice, whereas blood glucose and glucagon levels were similar (Fig. 5c). When challenged with an intraperitoneal glucose injection, HFD-fed, but not NCD-fed, Imp2ff/RIP2-Cre mice exhibited significantly higher glucose and lower insulin levels than Imp2ff mice (Fig. 5d, e). Importantly, this was not due to a difference in insulin sensitivity, as blood glucose levels after an intraperitoneal insulin injection were similar in Imp2ff and Imp2ff/RIP2-Cre mice (Supplementary Fig. 6c). These results indicate that Imp2 deficiency limits the capacity of beta cells to augment insulin secretion in response to increased insulin demand.",

    "content": "Results\n\nTwo hundred and fifty-seven (257) postpartum women were genotyped for 9 polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor. SNP information including call rate, allele frequency and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is listed in Table 3. We first conducted a linkage disequilibrium test and determined that the 9 SNPs defined approximately six haplotype blocks, i.e. three of the SNPs were found to be in high LD with another SNP (Figure 2). This finding enabled us to perform a correction for multiple testing for 6 distinct haplotype blocks. We next examined whether any of the genotyped ESR1 SNPs were associated with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).\n\nEPDS scores from the 156 women who were screened ranged from 2-30 and appeared normally distributed (Supplemental Fig. 1). The association p-values from dominant recessive and additive allele tests conducted using EPDS as the phenotypic variable are shown in Table 4. Both the ESR1 TA-repeat (L allele) and rs2077647 (G allele) were significantly associated with EPDS score in a dominant allele test (p=0.007 and p=0.03), however, only the TA-repeat withstood correction for multiple testing for the number of ESR1 haplotype blocks (p=0.04).\n\nWe next conducted an analysis using a second outcome: postpartum depression case control in a partially overlapping group of 84 subjects (52 with confirmed PPD and 32 control postpartum women) using the same tests. Of the 84, 56 subjects overlapped. The other 28 subjects (17 PPD and 11 controls) did not have EPDS data and therefore had not been included in the EPDS association test. In the dominant allele test, both the TA repeat and rs2077647 were significantly associated with PPD, with OR=3.05 (p=0.02) and 2.58 (p=0.04), respectively (Table 5). However, these associations did not survive correction for multiple testing.\n\nOur next goal was to examine the effect of other candidate genes and gene-gene interactions with ESR1. For this purpose, we selected 11 functional polymorphisms in seven candidate genes for depression and other mental disorders. Table S1 lists the genes included in the analysis, including ESR1, while Table S3 contains information for each SNP genotyped. The majority of these SNPs were tested because they have previously been found to have regulatory effects. These include catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) and dopamine transporter (SLC6A3 or DAT). Additional variants from monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and serotonin transporter (SLC6A4 or SERT) have been proposed to be functional.\n\nAs with the ESR1 analysis, single variant models were built using additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models. Age was examined as a possible confounding factor, but no evidence was found, and it itself is not significantly associated with EPDS scores. As we have prior knowledge guiding our targeted selection of these functional variants, we did not perform corrections for multiple testing. In addition to the ESR1 TA-repeat, three SNPs were significant at an unadjusted level of 0.10 under at least two genetic models and level 0.05 significant under at least one genetic model (Table S4). In the additive model the following polymorphisms were statistically significant at p<0.05: COMT rs4680 p=0.03 and MAOA rs1137070 p=0.05. In the recessive model COMT rs4680 was p=0.025 and HTR2A rs6314 was p=0.02.\n\nTwo-variant main effect and interaction models were thoroughly investigated only for the univariate SNP with the lowest p value (the ESR1 TA-repeat). For the gene-gene interaction models, both the ESR1 TA-repeat and the 2nd SNP were considered in the additive genetic mode. Each of the 11 SNPs were considered for the interaction with ESR1 TA-repeat. Table 6A shows the list of interaction p-values (Wald p-value) in ascending order. Three interaction models were significant at the 0.05 level and are highlighted with a box. These include interaction with one SNP in the dopamine transporter DAT, and two genes that are involved in serotonergic signaling: SLC6A4 (SERT) and the serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A). The ESR1 TA-repeat interacted most significantly with SERTLPR. Since these data were unadjusted for multiple comparisons, only the most significant model was further examined.\n\nIn the best scoring interaction model, the interaction p-value was 0.007 for ESR1 TA-repeat – SERTLPR (Table 6B). The model p-value was 0.013, with R-squared 7%, which increased from 2.4% when only ESR1 was included in the model. The risk alleles in this interaction appear to be between the S allele of the SERTLPR and the L allele of the ESR1-TA repeat. Interpretations of the model are depicted in the 3×3 table (Table 6C), which includes means and standard deviations of EPDS and subject counts stratified by genotype. For clarity, SERTLPR genotypes are indicated with an underscore. The Total row shows that, ignoring the ESR1 TA-repeat, the mean EPDS is 14.9, 15.0, and 14.9 respectively for each SERTLPR genotype (“LL”, “LS”, and “SS”);",

The Total row shows that, ignoring the ESR1 TA-repeat, the mean EPDS is 14.9, 15.0, and 14.9 respectively for each SERTLPR genotype (“LL”, “LS”, and “SS”); reinforcing the fact that SERTLPR is not associated with EPDS by itself. However, among the ESR1 TA-repeat “LL” subjects (those homozygous for the minor L allele), the trend increases with SERTLPR genotype, from “LL” to “SS” (11.8, 16.3, 19.0), and for ESR1 TA-repeat “SS” subjects, the trend decreases from “LL” to “SS” (15.0, 12.1, 11.8). The subjects with the highest EPDS occur with SERT “SS” and ESR1 TA-repeat “LL” (value of 19.0 – though only 4 subjects had this genotype combination).\n\nBecause the ESR1 TA-repeat interaction with the SERTLPR was significant for EPDS score, we also examined the same interaction in the occurrence of postpartum depression: PPD versus control (n=84). These two variants were chosen as they scored the highest in a two variant interaction model in the first outcome. We employed three methods to examine a gene interaction (Table 7). The first method used logistic regression to model the association between PPD status and the ESR1 TA-repeat and the SERT-LPR in a 2-variant main effect model and interaction model. While there was no statistical interaction between these two variants using the dominant genetic models (to account for the smaller sample size and fewer minor alleles), the main effects model indicates a relationship. In the main effects model, the OR for ESR1 TA-repeat L allele increased from 3.8 to 4.3 (p=0.007) when adjusted for SERTLPR genotype (Table 7A). In a second method, after dividing the cohort into cases and controls, all of the subjects that had at least one copy of the minor allele for both the TA-repeat (L) and the LPR(S) were summed. These numbers were inserted into a two by two contingency table. The remaining subjects, those lacking at least one minor allele in both variants, in each case/control category were summed for the other half of the table (Table 7B). Genotypes for both variant were available for 47 PPD subjects and 28 controls. For the other 9 subjects, complete genotype data were not available. We found that the combination of the minor alleles in SERTLPR (S allele) and ESR1 TA-repeat (L allele) was significantly elevated in PPD cases, 27 out of 47 compared to 5 out of 28 controls (Fisher's p=0.0008). The third method was a logistic regression of specific allele combination frequencies of case subjects compared to controls (Table 7C). The L,S diplotype representing the ESR1 TA L allele and the SERTLPRS allele, differed significantly (p=0.002) between the cases (21%) and controls (6%)",

    "content": "Results\n\nWe performed a GWA analysis of morbidly obese cases and controls that have a lifelong history of leanness. The distribution of p-values for all SNPs that were analyzed for association with obesity is shown in the additional file 1, Figure S1 (Q-Q plot) and S2 (Manhattan plot). No SNP displayed genome-wide significant association with obesity in the GWA, that is P< 10-7. The SNPs showing the strongest association in the GWA were analyzed in additional case-control cohorts 700 SNPs were successfully genotyped in cohort 2. Of these, 23 were nominally associated with obesity with consistent effect direction as observed for the GWA (additional file 1, Table S2). 21 of these SNPs (one SNP assay failed and another SNP had already been investigated as a candidate gene) were subsequently analyzed in Swedish cohort 3 and French cohort 4. Two of the 21 SNPs displayed consistent effect direction and nominal significant association with obesity in these cohorts, rs2116830, and rs988712 (additional file 1, Table S2, Table 3). These two SNPs were subject to further confirmation.\n\nThe G-allele of rs2116830, located in intron 28 of the gene Potassium channel, calcium activated, large conductance, subfamily M, alpha member (KCNMA1) on chromosome 10, showed consistent effect direction and significant allelic association with obesity in the French cohort 5 comprising morbidly obese adults and population-based adult control subjects (P = 0.0017), but not in the German cohort 6 comprising morbidly obese youth and adult lean controls (P = 0.35) (Table 3, Figure 2A). The overall meta-analysis p-value for cases vs controls showed genome-wide significance (P = 2.82 × 10-10) with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.26 [95% C.I. 1.12-1.41], with no statistical evidence for heterogeneity in impact on obesity between cohorts (Figure 2A). The impact of the G-allele of rs2116830 on obesity under different genetic models was tested in a joint analysis of all case-control cohorts. The recessive, P = 2.5 × 10 -9 (OR 1.30 [95% C.I. 1.19-1.42]), but not the additive or dominant genetic model reached genome-wide significance (Table 4).\n\nrs988712*G, which is located 113,058 base pairs downstream of the established obesity locus BDNF on chromosome 11, showed consistent effect direction and was significantly associated with obesity in the French cohort 5 (P = 0.0020), but not in the German cohort 6 (P = 0.135). The overall meta-analysis p-value for association with obesity showed genome-wide significance (P = 5.2 × 10-17) with an OR of 1.36 [95% C.I. 1.20-1.55] (Figure 2B). There was statistical evidence for heterogeneity in impact on obesity between cohorts for rs988712 (P = 0.027). Additive, dominant and recessive genetic models reached genome-wide significance and the G-allele of rs988712 was associated with obesity in both men and women (Table 4). Only two of seven obesity-associated SNPs in the BDNF region in, rs6265 and rs10501087, were genotyped in our GWA cohort. Neither showed strong LD with rs988712 in our cohort, r2 0.57-0.59.\n\nFor the new obesity susceptibility locus rs2116830 (KCNMA1) we performed quantitative trait analysis of BMI in three adult population-based samples, n = 4133 in total (Table 1). One of these cohorts (controls in French cohort 5) was also used in the case-control studies described above. For BMI we could detect 1.0 kg/m2 difference between genotypes with 93% power with nominal P of 0.001. There was neither significant association with BMI in any population alone, nor in joint analysis of all three populations (additional file 1, Table S3). (The same results were obtained when we included gender, age, and ethnicity in the analysis (results not shown). When we compared allele frequencies between obese cases and non-obese controls in the population based samples we observed consistent effect direction (additional file 1, Table S3) as in the case-control analysis of obesity in cohorts 1-5 described above (Table 2). The results were non-significant; however, this was expected as the total number of obese cases in the population-based samples was small. 48 subjects had BMI > 35 kg/m2 and 267 subjects had BMI > 30 kg/m2.\n\nWe investigated to what extent our GWA replicated published obesity or BMI loci that had been identified by GWA analysis. For each of the more than 30 published loci, we selected one, or sometimes two, SNPs for which the strongest association with obesity or BMI had been reported. 13 of these SNPs, which represented eleven loci, were analyzed for association with obesity in cohort 1. The remaining SNPs were not represented on the Affymetrix 500K Gene chip arrays used for the GWA or the SNP did not pass our quality control. Besides BDNF, our GWA study confirmed allelic association for MC4R with nominal P< 0.05 (additional file 1, Table S4).\n\nAdipose tissue expression of KCNMA1 is increased in obesity\n\nTo elucidate potential mechanisms of action of KCNMA1 rs211",

    "content": "Results\n\nAll SNPs passed quality control guidelines. Associations between SNPs and clinical variables were analysed in the non-diabetic participants only. Results of association with FPG levels were comparable to those reported in the literature (all p ≤ 0.001), except for GCKR, for which we could not detect a significant effect on FPG levels (p = 0.23; results shown in Table 1). However, GCKR showed nominal evidence for decreased 2 h glucose, but did not reach a formally significant p value (p = 0.008; see Electronic supplementary material [ESM] Table 1). Furthermore, GCK and G6PC2 showed increased HbA1c levels (p = 5 × 10−8 and 3 × 10−5; ESM Table 1). In line with our FPG results, GCKR was not associated with HbA1c levels (p = 0.50). However, we did confirm the previously reported association of the T allele of rs1260326 (GCKR) with increased triacylglycerol levels (p = 9 × 10−7; ESM Table 1). Other clinical variables were not associated with any of the analysed variants (ESM Table 1). We analysed the combined effect of all SNPs by calculating the risk allele score for each individual. We observed a combined effect of the risk alleles on FPG levels. The increase in FPG level per additional risk allele was 0.05 (0.04–0.07) mmol/l, p = 2 × 10−13 (Fig. 1a). A similar result was observed for HbA1c: 0.03% (0.02–0.04%) increase per additional risk allele, p = 5 × 10−10 (Fig. 1b). We also analysed whether the rate of the age-related increase in FPG was affected by the number of risk alleles. However, we did not observe any divergence in these rates between the different risk allele scores in our cross-sectional data set (ESM Fig. 1). Separate analysis of only the participants with normal glucose tolerance (n = 2,041) did not alter any of the results (data not shown). \n\nNext, we analysed the association of the single gene variants and the risk allele score with type 2 diabetes susceptibility. Only rs10830963 (MTNR1B) and rs1799884 (GCK) showed weak evidence for association with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.02 and p = 0.06 respectively; Table 1 and ESM Table 2). Risk allele scores were calculated for the participants with normal glucose tolerance and those with type 2 diabetes and all risk allele groups were compared with the reference group having four risk alleles, since this was the most common group (31%). The lower risk allele groups showed a protective effect on type 2 diabetes, while the risk allele groups with more than four risk alleles showed an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (Table 2). Those with fewer than three risk alleles had a significantly reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (OR 0.77 [0.65–0.93], p = 0.005) whereas those with more than five had a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with the reference group (OR 2.05 [1.50–2.80], p = 4 × 10−6). Adjustment for age, sex and BMI did not alter the results. \n\nWe also noted a significant correlation with the age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in our study sample. We observed a per allele effect of −0.46 (−0.80 to −0.11) years in age at diagnosis per additional risk allele (p = 0.009; Table 2). At the extremes of the distribution, i.e. zero or one vs six to eight risk alleles, there was a difference of almost 4.5 years in age at diagnosis between the two groups (p = 0.002; Table 2).",

Further mutual adjustment for other lipids subtypes did not alter the findings. HbA1c concentration was lower with an increasing rMED. After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, each of the concentrations of TAG, HDL-C and HbA1c remained significantly associated with the rMED. \n\nEach two-point increment in the rMED was significantly inversely associated with TAG (β − 0·005, 95 % CI − 0·007, − 0·002), LDL-C (β − 0·001, 95 % CI − 0·003, 0·000), apoB:apoA-1 ratio (β − 0·002, 95 % CI − 0·005, 0·000) and HbA1c (β − 0·001, 95 % CI − 0·002, 0·000), while it was directly associated with HDL-C (β 0·004, 95 % CI 0·002, 0·005) and apoA-1 (β 0·006, 95 % CI 0·002, 0·009) (β coefficients for log-transformed variables). The rMED was inversely associated with hypertriacylglycerolaemia (TAG>1·7 mmol/l), with OR 0·89, 95 % CI 0·81, 0·98; model 3. Sensitivity analyses did not alter the main findings.\n\nAssociation between glucokinase regulatory protein SNP and metabolic markers\n\nBaseline characteristics according to the GCKR rs780094 SNP showed that no significant differences were observed in relation to age, sex, BMI, WC, social class and physical activity. Significant differences were found for educational level and lipid medication (see online Supplementary Table S1). The AA genotype (frequency 15·6 %) was associated with 0·16 mmol/l higher TAG concentrations compared with GG individuals in adjusted analyses (Table 3). The AA genotype was also significantly positively associated with TC and apoB, but no significant differences were found for other lipid parameters (HDL-C and apoA-1) by genotype (Table 3). We found a tendency towards lower HbA1c concentration for the A allele, but this was not statistically significant. Application of the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons did not alter these findings. Both GA and AA genotypes v. GG genotype were associated with a greater risk of hypertriacylglycerolaemia in adjusted analyses (GA: OR 1·23, 95 % CI 1·15, 1·33; AA: OR 1·47, 95 % CI 1·33, 1·62). \n\nJoint results of genotype and Mediterranean diet adherence on metabolic markers\n\n Table 4 demonstrates the joint results of genotype and MD adherence on metabolic parameters. Participants with the highest risk (AA genotype and with the lowest rMED) had 12·5 % higher TAG concentrations (mean 1·68 (95 % CI 1·63, 1·73) mmol/l) than those who had the lowest risk (mean 1·47 (95 % CI 1·45, 1·50) mmol/l; GG genotype with the highest rMED; Table 4). Similar results were found for TC concentrations (2·3 % higher) and apoB (3·1 % higher), respectively (Table 4). For HbA1c, the converse was the case with those who were GG homozygous with the lowest rMED having 3·3 % higher HbA1c concentration (Table 4). However, the association of MD adherence and metabolic markers did not differ significantly by genotype, with no significant gene–diet interactions for lipids or for HbA1c (TAG, P= 0·770; TC, P= 0·761; apoB, P= 0·860; HbA1c, P= 0·481). These findings were unchanged with correction for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. \n\nSimilar results were found when we analysed the rs1260326 SNP (in high linkage disequilibrium with the rs780094 SNP, r 2 0·94) in a small sample (n 7273; data not shown). Furthermore, we performed a subgroup analysis stratified by age ( < 59·1 years old v. >59·1 years old; cut-off points selected by median), physical activity (inactive or moderately inactive v. active or moderately active) and smoking status (smoker v. non-smoker) for the outcomes analysed in order to examine whether in any of these strata, a significant gene–diet interaction was obtained.

    "content": "Results\n\nA total of 65 patients (47 males and 18 females) with a diagnosis of CHI were included in the study. Age at diagnosis ranged from immediately following birth to seven years old. Twenty-three patients (35.4%) were macrosomic and their mean birth weight was 3,690 g. Sixty-two patients were born at term. The CHI symptoms were first noted during the neonatal period in 29 patients (44.6%), during the infancy period (1-12 months) in 26 patients (40%) and during childhood (>12 months) in 10 patients (15.4%).\n\nOf the 65 patients, 13 were diazoxide-unresponsive, 40 patients were diazoxide-responsive and 12 received dietary treatment only. Patients were divided into two groups based on diazoxide responsiveness; Group 1, diazoxide-unresponsive and Group 2, responsive to diazoxide or dietary treatment. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of the patients in the two groups are presented in Table 1. Age at onset of CHI was significantly different between these two groups. The neonatal form comprised 92.3% of Group 1, but only 32.7% of Group 2. There was a significantly higher incidence of epilepsy in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p<0.05). The time between symptom manifestation and diagnosis ranged from one day to six years, and the duration was again significantly longer in Group 2. A patient (Case 61) in Group 2 was six years old and was initially misdiagnosed as having a seizure disorder before the hypoglycemia was detected.\n\nIn our study, ABCC8 mutations were identified in 16 children (25% of the cohort), and no KCNJ11 mutations were identified on KATP channel gene mutation analysis. Five patients with persistent HA had mutations in GLUD1 (Figure 1). No variants were found in the GCK gene. Fifteen different ABCC8 mutations were discovered, five mutations were compound heterozygous, 11 were heterozygous and none were homozygous (Table 2). Among the children who carried compound heterozygous mutations, diazoxide treatment was effective in three children. Treatment was not effective in one child and one child was regulated with diet.\n\nThe most common mutation was a deletion/insertion mutation c.3224-3226delACC ins CAGCCAGGAACTG (p.Thr1042GlnfsX75) found in five unrelated patients, which possibly represents a relatively common mutation in southern China. Five novel ABCC8 mutations (p.Phe5SerfsX72, p.Gln273ArgfsX85, p.Leu724del, p.Asp1447Gly and IVS 25-1G>T) were identified. Of the novel mutations, two were frameshift mutations, one was a deletion mutation, one was a missense mutation and one was a splice site mutation. In accordance with the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), two variants were perceived as “pathogenic” and three variants were predicted as “likely pathogenic”. A novel heterozygous variant in ABCC8 gene was identified in case 22. The patient has now been on therapy with diazoxide for more than one year at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day with normal growth and development. In one case (patient 59), two novel mutations were identified. This girl was macrosomic at birth. Hypoglycemia was first detected on day three after birth at a local hospital, and improved with frequent feedings. However, her parents did not monitor her blood glucose. She was admitted to our hospital at age 14 months for brief generalized convulsive periods. Laboratory tests revealed hypoglycemia (blood glucose: 2.5 mmol/L) HI (plasma insulin level: 5.9 µIU/mL) when she had an episode. Four hourly daytime feeds (solids and cow’s milk) and four hourly uncooked cornstarch (1.6 g/kg) could maintain the blood glucose above 3.5 mmol/L. During six months follow-up, there was no episodes of hypoglycemia. However, she had sustained hypoglycaemic brain injury with global developmental delay.\n\nIn this study, 16 parents underwent genetic analysis. Five patients (patients 1, 5, 10, 14 and 18) had paternally inherited monoallelic mutations. Of the five patients, three were diazoxide-unresponsive and two were diazoxide-responsive. In the three diazoxide-unresponsive patients (patients 1, 5 and 10), diffuse pancreatic disease was confirmed following surgery. One patient (patient 3) had two heterozygous mutations: one missense mutation c.314A>C (p.His105Pro) in exon 3, inherited from his father and a nonsense mutation c.2800C>T (p.Gln934X) in exon 23 inherited from his mother. He was diazoxide-unresponsive, which had been previously reported. The 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan indicated a focal lesion in the head of the pancreas, whereas the histology of the resected pancreas showed atypical form. The enlargement of pancreatic β-cell nuclei were distributed mainly in the head but included the body and tail of the pancreas. The abnormal active endocrine cells were not restricted to a focal lesion nor were they present throughout the entire pancreas.\n\nThe GLUD1 gene was detected in patients with hypoglycaemia, HI and mild HA. Three different heterozygous mutations in the GLUD1 gene were identified in five patients. The p.Arg322 His mutation was found in patients 54, 55 and 56. Patients 55 and 56",

The abnormal active endocrine cells were not restricted to a focal lesion nor were they present throughout the entire pancreas.\n\nThe GLUD1 gene was detected in patients with hypoglycaemia, HI and mild HA. Three different heterozygous mutations in the GLUD1 gene were identified in five patients. The p.Arg322 His mutation was found in patients 54, 55 and 56. Patients 55 and 56 were sisters. The mutation was autosomal and dominantly inherited from their father, who was an asymptomatic carrier. The p.Ser498Leu mutation was found in patient 52 and the p.Asn463Asp mutation in patient 53. All mutations have been previously reported in patients with HI/HA. The serum ammonia concentration of this group of patients was 85-184 µmol/l. After a confirmation of the diagnosis of HI/HA syndrome due to a GLUD1 genetic defect, the patients were started on a low-protein diet (1.5 g/kg/day of natural protein intake). Three patients (patients 54, 55 and 56) were successfully managed by diet alone. They have had no further hypoglycaemic episodes. The other two patients were responsive to diazoxide treatment.\n\nOf 65 patients, 40 (61.5%) achieved long-term stable glycaemic control by diazoxide alone. Octreotide was administered to three children who were not responsive to diazoxide. Among these three patients, two were unresponsive to octreotide, and one patient discontinued this drug due to severe diarrhoea. Side effects of the diazoxide treatment were observed in 32 (80%) patients. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, severe gastrointestinal upset and poor appetite occurred in 69%. Six patients were fed through a nasogastric tube because of severe gastrointestinal reactions and their blood glucose levels were kept relatively stable. Different degrees of hypertrichosis occurred in 55% (22/40) of patients during clinical follow-up. In one case (patient 43), effective diazoxide therapy had to be stopped because of thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nPancreatectomy was performed in 10 patients who were unresponsive to drugs. Nine patients were treated with subtotal pancreatectomy, and one patient underwent pancreatectomy twice. In patient 3, a second resection of the pancreas was required because of sustained hypoglycaemia. Histological examination of the resected pancreatic tissue confirmed diffuse disease in nine patients and atypical form in one patient. One patient (patient 7) who underwent surgery at two months of age developed diabetes mellitus at five years of age and was treated with insulin. Case 8 developed diabetes mellitus immediately after surgery and required insulin treatment. Two cases still had mild hypoglycaemia after surgery; one (patient 4) was successfully managed with regular daytime and overnight feedings and the other (patient 9) was treated with diazoxide. Only one case had symptoms of malabsorption.\n\nDiazoxide treatment was stopped in 14 of patients (35%), between the ages of six months and four years, and no recurrence of hypoglycaemia was observed. Eight patients with subtotal resection were able to maintain normal blood glucose and HbA1c levels during the duration of follow-up. There were three diazoxide-unresponsive patients: one patient died of multiorgan failure and two patients abandoned the treatment and died of severe hypoglycemia after three to seven days at home.",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nLevels of KBs across the categories of glucose tolerance.\n\nWe evaluated the association of AcAc and BHB in nondiabetic individuals and individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG) categories (Fig. 1). FPG ≤5.4 mmol/L and 2hPG ≤5.9 mmol/L were set as the reference categories. In the FPG category, AcAc levels decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in individuals with IFG by −2% (95% CI −4 to −0) and increased significantly (P < 0.01) in individuals with newly detected diabetes by +64% (+16 to +109), as compared with the reference category. BHB level decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in subjects with IFG by −5% (−7 to −3) and increased significantly (P < 0.01) in the diabetic range by +99% (+6 to +186). In the 2hPG category, AcAc level increased significantly (P < 0.01) in subjects with IGT by +21% (+13 to +28) as well as in newly diagnosed diabetes by +29% (+16 to +42), as compared with the reference category. BHB level increased nominally in IGT (P < 0.05) by +12% (+4 to +20) and in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (P < 0.01) by +52% (+23 to +79), as compared with the reference category. Fasting AcAc and BHB levels correlated significantly with FPG (r = −0.051, P = 1.9 × 10−6, and r = −0.065, P = 1.4 × 10−9, respectively) and 2hPG levels (r = 0.079, P = 1.4 × 10−13, and r = 0.042, P = 9.2 × 10−5, respectively).\n\nKBs and the risk of hyperglycemia and incident diabetes.\n\nFollow-up data of 4,335 participants were available from the ongoing prospective METSIM 5-year follow-up study. A total of 276 participants developed incident diabetes between the baseline and follow-up studies (follow-up of 5 years). Most of the participants who developed new diabetes on the basis of FPG level (62 of 70 participants) had their FPG in the range of 7.0–7.5 mmol/L, and most of the participants who developed new diabetes on the basis of 2hPG had their 2hPG level (52 of 80 participants) in the range of 11.1–12.0 mmol/L. AcAc and BHB levels adjusted for confounding factors known to increase the risk of diabetes (age, BMI, smoking, and physical activity) predicted an increase in glucose AUC evaluated as a continuous variable at follow-up (P = 2.3 × 10−4 and P = 5.7 × 10−6, respectively), and quite similar results were obtained for the comparison of the highest quartile of glucose AUC versus the three lowest quartiles of glucose AUC (P = 7.9 × 10−8 and P = 3.4 × 10−6, respectively) (Table 1). After further adjustment for baseline glucose AUC, the associations lost their statistical significance. The highest quartile of AcAc adjusted for age, BMI, smoking, and physical activity predicted conversion to type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.32 [95% CI 1.00–1.74], P = 0.047) (Table 2), and also after further adjustment for FPG (OR 1.41 [1.06–1.89], P = 0.019). Adjustment for 2hPG, instead of FPG, abolished statistical significance (P = 0.423). When analyzed in glucose tolerance categories, AcAc predicted incident diabetes in individuals with IFG (OR 1.49 [1.12–1.99], P = 0.007) after the adjustment for confounding factors.\n\nAdditional adjustment for insulin sensitivity strengthened the association of KBs with development of hyperglycemia and conversion to type 2 diabetes, whereas insulin secretion weakened/abolished these associations (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nLevels of KBs across the quintiles of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.\n\nTo study the mechanisms by which KBs could be linked to hyperglycemia, we investigated their association with insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. The levels of AcAc and BHB increased significantly (P < 0.01) in the highest quintile of Matsuda ISI up to 29 and 41%, respectively (Fig. 2). AcAc and BHB levels decreased significantly (P < 0.01) by −23 and −29%, respectively, in the highest quintile of insulin secretion (adjusted for insulin sensitivity) compared with the lowest quintile. In a multivariate linear regression model including insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion as independent variables, insulin sensitivity remained inversely associated with AcAc (P < 1.0 × 10−19) and BHB levels (P < 1.0 × 10−22).\n\nAssociation of risk SNPs for type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia with the levels of KBs.\n\nAssociations of 62 risk SNPs for type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia with KB levels are shown in Table 3.

After correction for multiple testing (threshold of statistical significance, P < 4.0 × 10−4), the glucose-increasing C allele of rs780094 of GCKR showed a significant association with elevated levels of BHB (effect size +5.6% per the C allele, P = 3.7 × 10−6 after adjusting for age and BMI) and a nominally significant association with AcAc (+3.9%, P = 0.003). Additionally, there were nominally significant associations for SNPs of FADS1, ANK1, GIPR, HMGA2, and SLC2A2 with the levels of AcAc or BHB or both (Table 3).\n\nGene expression of genes involved in KB metabolism.\n\nCorrelations of adipose tissue mRNA expression with the most important genes regulating FFA oxidation, ketogenesis, and ketolysis are shown in Table 4. Pearson correlation of fasting FFAs with AcAc was 0.483 (P < 0.001) and with BHB was 0.443 (P < 0.001) in nondiabetic METSIM participants, and therefore genes regulating FFA metabolism were included in statistical analyses. Adipose tissue mRNA expression of the gene encoding CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) was positively correlated with glucose AUC and inversely with Matsuda ISI. This enzyme regulates the binding of carnitine to long-chain fatty acids, allowing them to be transported to the mitochondria for FFA oxidation. Expression of genes regulating ketogenesis, HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1, soluble) and HMGCS2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2, mitochondrial), did not correlate significantly with glucose AUC, insulin sensitivity, or insulin secretion. In contrast, significant correlations were found with adipose tissue mRNA expression levels of several genes associated with ketolysis with glucose metabolism parameters. Of these genes, ACAT1 expression had the most significant correlations with glucose AUC (r = −0.314, P = 6.1 × 10−6), Matsuda ISI (r = 0.479, P = 7.1 × 10−13), and insulin secretion (r = −0.444, P = 7.0 × 10−11). ACAT1 encodes acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1, an enzyme responsible for the last step in KB breakdown where two molecules of acetyl-CoA are generated from acetoacetyl-CoA (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, expression of other genes regulating ketolysis, BDH1 (BHB dehydrogenase, type 1), OXCT1 (3-oxoacid CoA transferase 1), and ACSS2 (acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2), was inversely correlated with glucose AUC and insulin secretion and positively correlated with Matsuda ISI. Adipose tissue mRNA expression of ketolysis genes did not correlate with the levels of KBs (all correlations <0.10, P = NS).",

    "content": "Results\n\nOne hundred and thirty‐three men were recruited and randomised into lycopene and green tea intervention groups (Fig. 2). One hundred and thirty‐two men attended the six‐month follow‐up appointment. Not all participants had sufficient blood available for metabolic profiling in the current study; metabolic measures were available for 119 men at baseline and 128 men at follow‐up.\n\nBaseline characteristics\n\nSupporting Information Tables 1 and 2 show the baseline characteristics of the men stratified by lycopene and green tea treatment groups, respectively. Men were a mean age of 64.5 years (SD 5.0), had a mean BMI of 27.0 kg/m2 and had a median baseline PSA level of 2.6 ng/mL. There were no apparent differences across intervention arms with respect to any of the sociodemographic or lifestyle variables considered. Two of the men, randomised to lycopene and green tea supplement arms had diabetes.\n\nAmong the 116 men with complete baseline metabolic measures data, there were no clear differences in metabolic traits between the lycopene randomisation arms pre‐intervention (Supporting Information Table 3). At baseline, there was evidence of by‐arm differences in glycine, phenylalanine, alanine, glycoprotein acetyls and a number of fatty acid metabolic measures in the green tea group (Supporting Information Table 3).\n\nDifference in metabolite levels between intervention groups at six‐month follow‐up\n\nCorrelation between metabolic profiles from lycopene dietary advice and supplement arms\n\nThere was a strong correlation between the effects of supplements compared to the effects of the dietary advice interventions on 6‐month metabolic measures (slope = 1.07 ± 0.06; R 2 = 0.65) (Fig. 3), which remained when regression models were adjusted for baseline serum metabolite levels (Supporting Information Fig. 1). Forest plots comparing the metabolic profile of supplemental and dietary advice interventions provide further confirmation that they have broadly comparable effects on the measured metabolic traits (Fig. 3). There were consistent decreases in the glycolysis‐related metabolites glucose, lactate and pyruvate after lycopene supplement and dietary advice interventions, as well as decreases in branched‐chain amino acid measures isoleucine, leucine and valine.\n\nLycopene effects\n\nThere was strong evidence of a reduction in valine in both supplement and dietary advice arms compared to placebo (β = −0.62; 95% CI = −1.03, −0.20; p = 0.004) and β = −0.65; 95% CI = −1.04, −0.26; p = 0.001 respectively, whereby β represents the standard deviation (SD) change in metabolic measures), as well as increased levels of acetate in the lycopene supplement group (β = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.24, 1.15; p = 0.003) (Table 1). There was some evidence that serum pyruvate and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were lower in the lycopene supplement group compared to placebo (β = −0.56; 95% CI = −0.95, −0.16; p = 0.006 and β = −0.50; 95% CI = −085, −0.14; p = 0.006 respectively), although effects did not reach our strict threshold for multiple testing (p = 0.004). Serum diacylglycerol levels were lower in the lycopene dietary advice group compared to placebo (β = −0.59; 95% CI = −1.01, −0.18; p = 0.006). See Supporting Information Table 4 for full results, including associations, expressed as magnitudes in absolute concentration units (e.g. mmol/L metabolite difference between diet or supplement vs. placebo).\n\nThe trends for decreased valine, increased acetate and decreased pyruvate, were largely robust to adjustment for baseline metabolites (Supporting Information Table 5).\n\nCorrelation between metabolic profiles from green tea diet and supplement arms\n\nOverall, the effects of green tea drinking and supplement interventions at follow‐up on serum metabolome were similar (slope = 0.57 ± 0.03, R 2 = 0.76) (Fig. 3).\n\nGreen tea effects\n\nThere was no strong evidence of an effect of green tea supplementation on serum metabolic profile. In the group advised to drink green tea, there was evidence of a reduction in the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids relative to total fatty acids (PUFA: FA) (vs. placebo), which survived correction for multiple testing (β = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.273, 1.049; p = 0.001) (Table 1). There was weaker evidence of a change in the proportions of omega‐6 and monounsaturated fatty acids relative to total fatty acids (β = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.19, 1.00; p = 0.005 and β = −0.58; 95% CI = −0.99, −0.17; p = 0.006, respectively). Post green‐tea drinking intervention levels of glycine were also lower compared to placebo (β = −0.58; 95% CI = −0.98, −0.18; p = 0.005) (full results in Supporting Information Table 6). The trends for increased PUFA: FA and reduced glycine, which were observed in the unadjusted green tea analyses, were not present in the adjusted analyses (Supporting Information Table",

Post green‐tea drinking intervention levels of glycine were also lower compared to placebo (β = −0.58; 95% CI = −0.98, −0.18; p = 0.005) (full results in Supporting Information Table 6). The trends for increased PUFA: FA and reduced glycine, which were observed in the unadjusted green tea analyses, were not present in the adjusted analyses (Supporting Information Table 5).\n\nIV estimates\n\nResults of the lycopene IV regression were broadly consistent with those of the intention to treat analysis (Supporting Information Table 7). There was an increase in acetate (β = 2.13; p = 0.006) and decreases in pyruvate (β = −1.90; p = 0.009), valine (β = −1.79; p = 0.023), diacylglycerol (β = −1.81; p = 0.026) and DHA (p = 0.097). Alanine was also lower (β = −1.55; p = 0.015). The IV analysis provided no strong evidence that green tea altered circulating metabolite levels (Supporting Information Table 7).\n\nMendelian randomisation\n\nCausal effects of metabolites on prostate cancer\n\nAcetate, pyruvate, valine, diacylglycerol and DHA were taken forward for MR analysis because both the intention‐to‐treat and the IV analysis indicated they were modified in response to lycopene dietary intervention, although not all metabolic traits met our strict threshold for multiple testing. Glycine was also taken forward, since increased green tea intake was associated with altered glycine levels in the intention‐to‐treat analysis.\n\nWe identified 17 genetic variants associated with our metabolites of interest at genome‐wide significance (p < 5 × 10−8 for the allelic effect of each SNP on the exposure) in the MR Base GWAS database (http://www.mrbase.org/) (Table 2). The genetic variants comprised five sets of candidate genetic instruments corresponding to acetate, valine, pyruvate, DHA and glycine. Diacylglycerol was not available in the GWAS summary statistics from Kettunen et al., 27 therefore this metabolite could not be instrumented.\n\nThe MR analysis provided some evidence that genetically raised pyruvate increased the odds of prostate cancer by 1.29 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.62; p = 0.027 (Bonferroni corrected p value = 0.05/4 = 0.0125)), using 2 SNPs (Table 3). There was no evidence that acetate, valine DHA, or glycine were causal in prostate cancer. Given evidence of a causal effect of pyruvate on prostate cancer risk, we further investigated functionality of the SNPs used to instrument pyruvate to identify potential pleiotropy. rs1260326 is located within GCKR, coding for the glucokinase regulatory protein which has a widespread effect on metabolite levels and is therefore likely to be highly pleiotropic (Supporting Information Fig. 2) rs74249229 is not consistently associated with other metabolites apart from pyruvate, alanine and lactate, which are all very closely related metabolites. However, as the variant is located within the PDPR (pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase regulatory) gene, this suggests the SNP primarily influences pyruvate, and therefore alanine and lactate through vertical (rather than horizontal) pleiotropy, suggesting that this SNP is likely to be a valid instrument for the MR analysis of pyruvate. Using only this SNP as an instrument, the causal effect of pyruvate on prostate cancer was found to be 1.31 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.93, p = 0.154), consistent with a positive causal effect of pyruvate on prostate cancer risk, albeit with a wider confidence interval.",

While 118 (85%) cases were in the prepubertal period, 21 (15%) cases were in the pubertal period. Age of obesity onset was found as 3.2 ± 2.1 years in the study group. Mean birth weight was 3546 ± 746 g.\n\nSeven different variants in 12 patients were identified by giving a variant detection rate of 8.6%. Of these, 5 were previously identified missense variants p.N274S, p.S136F, p.V166I, p.R165W, and p.I291SfsX10. Previously identified p.N274S variant was the most common detected variant and was found in 4 cases from different families. Two novel variants were found: p.M200del and p.S188L. By using the in silico analysis software, these novel variants were predicted to be disease causing (Table 1).\n\nAge of obesity onset was found to be lower in the variant carrier cases (2.2 ± 1.1 vs 4.7 ± 2.9 years, p = 0.01). No statistically significant difference was found between the cases with and without variant in terms of age, height SDS, BMI, BMI SDS, blood pressure, serum fasting glucose, and lipid values. HOMA-IR value was higher in variant carrier group (5.4 ± 1.8 vs 3.9 ± 2.6, p = 0.04) (Table 2). No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of blood pressure and serum lipid levels.\n\nIn variant carrier group, mean BMI SDS was found as 3.8 ± 1.5 SDS. While insulin resistance was found in 11 (91.6%) cases, acanthosis nigricans was found in 3 (25%) cases, liver steatosis in 5 (41.6%) cases, psychiatric disorder in 2 (16.6%) cases, and TSH elevation in 2 (16.6%) cases. High blood pressure was observed in only one case. Diabetes was not detected in any patient.\n\nHomozygous p.I291Sfs*10 variant causing the formation of stop codon resulting in frameshift was detected in a 2-year-old male patient (patient 5), and he had increased appetite and weight increase from the sixth month of his life. BMI SDS value of this case was 7.3 SD (severe obesity). The patient’s mother was shown to have a heterozygous variant (mother’s BMI SDS, 1.5 SD), and no sample could be taken from the father. It was decided that the variant was pathological because variant caused the stop codon and had a correlation with the disease in in silico programs.\n\nOne patient (patient 12) admitted to us with severe obesity had p.N274S variant, and he had also hepatosteatosis, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) elevation (5.19 mIU/L), systolic and diastolic non-dipper hypertension, and insulin resistance. During follow-up due to rapid weight gain and major depressive disorder, sleeve gastrectomy operation was performed in 16 years old (175 kg + 5.64 SDS; 194 cm + 3.15 SDS; BMI, 46.5 + 3.76 SDS).

Description of Identified Variants \n\nMutation screen of the coding region of MC4R identified a total of four variants, three known nonsynonymous variants, rs776051881 (Glu42Lys), rs766665118 (Thr150Ile), and rs775382722 (Arg305Gln), and one nonsynonymous polymorphism rs52820871 (Ile251Leu) (Table 1). First, we classified variants as leading to reduced receptor function or similar to the wild type MC4R function. Three previously reported variants (Glu42Lys, Thr150Ileu, and Arg305Gln) lead to a reduced MC4R function as classified by in-silico predictors that claim them to be disease causing. Furthermore, some in-vitro analyses had described reduced function for the mutations Thr150Ileu and Arg305Gln. Our study shows a frequency of 2.52% of MC4R mutations leading to a reduced function in our sample of Spanish of children with abdominal obesity.\n\nThe mutation screen of the coding region of LCN2 identified a total of twelve variants, eleven are located in intronic regions (rs2232632, rs202024127, rs11794980, rs2232629, rs2232625, rs2232626, rs116745581, rs2232628, rs568419305, rs2232631, rs2232632) and one is a known nonsynonymous variant: rs79993583 (Thr124Met). The analysis of all detected variants by in-silico predictors show that three of them could be disease causing (Supplementary Table S1). \n\n3.2. Phenotypic Description of Mutation Carriers\n\nIn Table 2 phenotypic characteristics of participants with mutations at MC4R and LCN2 genes at baseline are described in detail. We also provide data from obese participants of IGENOI study without mutations in the coding regions of these genes. \n\nFor 103 children (37.8% males) with a mean age of 11.32 years no mutations in MC4R and LCN2 genes were found, they are wild type carriers. Mutated subjects are compared with them in the subsequent analyses. All wild type carriers were also obese (BMI-SDS: 2.92 ± 1.10) and 41.7% showed clinical evidence for insulin resistance in the presence of Acanthosis Nigricans that was accompanied by a HOMA-IR of 4.03 ± 3.17. \n\nA 14 year-old girl was heterozygous for the Glu42Lys mutation at the MC4R gene. She suffers from severe-obesity (BMI-SDS:4.04) reflected in a fat mass of 40.8%. The main clinical features of this participant were leptin levels higher than expected for the BMI, and the presence of insulin resistance observed as hyperinsulinemia, increased HOMA-IR (4.23), and Acanthosis Nigricans. \n\nMutation Thr150Ileu at the MC4R gene was observed in an eight year-old boy with a BMI-SDS of +3.5. Biochemical parameters were normal and the participant was physically active (50.65 min/day). One participant carries two variants at the MC4R gene: Arg305Gln and the polymorphism Ile251Leu. She is a 12 year-old girl with a BMI-SDS of 2.91, and a fat mass of 43.2% (measured by bioimpedance). Five independent children also carried the polymorphism Ile251Leu. They had a mean age of nine years and a mean BMI-SDS of 2.69. In comparison with the participants with the wild type receptor, none of the participants carrying this polymorphism showed Acanthosis Nigricans. \n\nThe polymorphism Ile251Leu of MC4R was observed in five participants with a mean age of nine years old. We found increased levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in comparison to participants without MC4R mutation (p = 0.004 and p = 0.013; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). These differences persist when subjects with the Ile251Leu MC4R mutation were compared to age and sex matched subjects without MC4R mutation (Supplementary Table S2). \n\nOne male 15 year-old heterozygously carried the mutation Thr124Met at the LCN2 gene. Clinical characteristics of this participant included severe obesity (BMI-SDS = +4.01) accompanied by an elevated percentage of fat mass (38.7%). Also, a remarkable difference of higher levels of MVPA was detected in comparison with the wild type population. The carrier of this mutation was much more active than the wild-type controls (120.92 min/day vs. 44.82 min/day, p = 0.088). We also evaluated the siblings (three girls) of the index patient, all of them were obese. Two of them were also carriers of Thr124Met (BMI-SDS: 3.47 and BMI-SDS: 3.76). The MAF for this variant in the LCN2 gene in the study population is 0.44%.\n\n3.3. Children Eating Behavior\n\nThe eating behavior scores with four dimension charts of children with abdominal obesity at baseline is described in Figure 1.

Change in BMI-SDS and Mutations in MC4R and LCN2 After 8-Week and 1-Year of Follow Up\n\nCarriers of mutations that lead to a reduced function in MC4R and LCN2 genes showed a disparity of responses to the lifestyle intervention (Table 3). Changes in BMI-SDS of the five subject carriers of the Ile251Leu polymorphism are quite variable with two of them not showing any improvement at 1 year. Moreover, no significant differences in BMI-SDS changes were found after eight weeks or one-year of follow up in mutated carriers vs. non carriers subjects in analysis conducted in matched age and sex subjects with and without a functional mutation in MC4R (Supplementary Table S3).",

The mean age for the cancer patients and the controls were 53.88 ± 9.1 and 51.61 ± 9.7 years, respectively. No significant differences were observed in age, gender, ethnicity and smoking status. Among the cancer subjects, 36.25 per cent had family history with cancers. This included first and second degree relatives; 13.75 per cent of the cases had early stages of CRC; and 50 per cent of the overall CRC cases had advanced stages of CRC. Red meat, fruits and vegetable consumption and exercise were significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk relative to controls (P<0.05, data not shown). Conditional logistic regression model showed that a diet with red meat comprising > 50 per cent of total daily dietary intake increased the risk of CRC development [OR=6.52, 95% CI : 93-2.04, P=0.003; meanwhile, high fruits and vegetables intake (at least 50% daily food intake) and physical exercise at least once a week served as protective factors against CRC.\n\nGenotyping was successful for all the 160 samples. For each SNP, the average call rate was 99.4 per cent. SNPs that departed from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<0.05) were excluded from the analysis. Based on dominant and recessive models, 12 SNPs were found to increase the risk of CRC, and 11 SNPs reduced the risk of CRC (Tables II, III, P<0.01). Among these, a SNP located in genes of cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily, rs2069521 of CYP1A2 has been shown to yield the highest significant value with adjusted P value (q-value) 0.00011. rs10046 in CYP19A1 was found to be protective against CRC risk among Malaysian population [OR=0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-0.21), q<0.001].\n\nThe potential gene-environment interaction of the aforementioned SNPs with red meat consumption and CRC susceptibility was investigated. In Table IV, the association of rs2069521 and rs10046 with CRC risk was stratified according to red meat intake. A significant association (P<0.05) was found between the SNP rs2069521 of CYP1A2 and red meat intake. Among the subjects with low red meat consumption (<50% daily dietary intake), AA and AG genotypes of rs2069521 conferred cancer risk to the Malaysian population (OR=3.10 versus 3.61). However, the genotypes conferred an increased risk of CRC by four-fold among subjects with a high red meat consumption diet (≥ 50% daily dietary intake; OR=13.2; Table IV). This demonstrated that the allele A of rs2069521 might allow CYP1A2 to functionally increase the activation of oxidizing carcinogens, resulting in an increased rate of carcinogenic DNA damage. This effect was further compounded by unhealthy high red meat diet, the source of CYP1A2 substrates.",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nCharacteristics of the study populations and IRS1 variants\n\nIn both GOLDN and BPRHS populations, men had a significantly higher physical activity score, total energy and MUFA intake, SFA-to-carbohydrate ratio, dietary GL, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure than women, whereas HDL-C and dietary carbohydrate intake were lower in men than women (Table 1). Minor allele frequencies of the two IRS1 variants, rs7578326 (G allele) and rs2943641 (T allele), were 0.328 and 0.355 in GOLDN and 0.364 and 0.328 in the BPRHS. Neither IRS1 variant deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectation in either population (P > 0.05). This pair of IRS1 variants was in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) in both GOLDN (r2 = 0.714) and the BPRHS (r2 = 0.458).\n\nMeta-analysis of IRS1 variants with HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, IFG/T2D, and MetS\n\nFor SNP rs7578326, G-allele carriers had significantly lower HOMA-IR (z = −3.102, P = 0.002) and fasting insulin (z = −3.648, P = 0.0003) than A-allele homozygotes (Supplementary Table 1). For SNP rs2943641, T-allele carriers had a significantly lower HOMA-IR (z = −3.08, P = 0.002) and fasting insulin (z = −2.932, P = 0.003) than C-allele homozygotes. No significant heterogeneity was observed (P heterogeneity >0.1).\n\nThe pooled odds ratios (ORs) of type 2 diabetes (pooled OR 1.83 [95% CI 1.18–2.85], P = 0.007) and MetS (1.47 [1.06–2.05], P = 0.023) were both statistically significant for the rs7578326 A-allele carriers compared with G-allele homozygotes (Table 2). For SNP rs2943641, C-allele carriers had a higher risk of IFG/T2D (1.69 [1.16–2.45], P = 0.006) and MetS (1.60 [1.13–2.26], P = 0.008), compared with T-allele homozygotes. No significant heterogeneity was observed (P heterogeneity >0.1).\n\nInteraction of IRS1 variants with diet for HOMA-IR and fasting insulin\n\nAll dietary factors were dichotomized based on the median intake of each population for the interaction analysis. Meta-analysis was not performed for the gene-diet interaction between the two populations, as the food frequency questionnaires used and dietary intake ranges were different between the two populations. In GOLDN, both rs7578326 and rs2943641 significantly interacted with dietary MUFA (rs7578326: P = 0.024; rs2943641: P = 0.008) (Fig. 1), SFA (rs7578326: P = 0.019; rs2943641: P = 0.01), total fat (rs7578326: P = 0.038; rs2943641: P = 0.01), carbohydrate (rs7578326: P = 0.009; rs2943641: P = 0.002), and SFA-to-carbohydrate ratio (rs7578326: P = 0.003; rs2943641: P = 0.003) for HOMA-IR (Table 3). SNP rs7578326 G-allele carriers and rs2943641 T-allele carriers, compared with noncarriers, had significantly lower HOMA-IR when consuming low MUFA, low total fat, or low SFA-to-carbohydrate ratio. SNP rs7578326 also interacted with dietary carbohydrate (P = 0.027) and SFA-to-carbohydrate ratio (P = 0.017) for fasting insulin, whereas rs2943641 interacted with MUFA (P = 0.033), carbohydrate (P = 0.004), and SFA-to-carbohydrate ratio (P = 0.014) for fasting insulin (data not shown). To further explore the potential influence of carbohydrate quality, we examined the interactions of IRS1 variants with dietary GL and GI for HOMA-IR and fasting insulin, but with no significant results (data not shown).\n\nIn the BPRHS, rs7578326 tended to interact with dietary MUFA for HOMA-IR (P = 0.07) (Fig. 1), and rs7578326 G-allele carriers showed lower HOMA-IR compared with A-allele homozygotes only when MUFA intake was low (≤11.0% energy, P = 0.011), but not when it was high (>11.0% energy). In addition, this SNP significantly interacted with dietary GL on HOMA-IR (P = 0.038) and fasting insulin (P = 0.014). HOMA-IR for G-allele carriers of rs7578326 was significantly lower than noncarriers when dietary GL was low (≤141.2, P = 0.007), but not for high GL (>141.2). No significant interactions with GI or other dietary factors were observed for rs7578326. For rs2943641, no significant gene-diet interaction was observed",

For rs2943641, no significant gene-diet interaction was observed (data not shown).\n\nInteraction of IRS1 variants with diet for type 2 diabetes, IFG/T2D, and MetS\n\nIn the GOLDN population, no significant interaction between IRS1 variants and dietary factors for the risk of type 2 diabetes or IFG/T2D was observed, whereas both rs7578326 and rs2943641 significantly interacted with dietary total fat, carbohydrate, and SFA-to-carbohydrate ratio to modulate risk of MetS (Table 3). Only when dietary SFA-to-carbohydrate ratio was low (≤0.24) did subjects with rs7578326 G allele have a lower risk of MetS compared with AA carriers (OR 0.52 [95% CI 0.34–0.80]), and only when the ratio was low (≤0.24) did rs2943641 T-allele carriers, compared with the CC carriers, have a lower risk of MetS (0.63 [0.41–0.99]). There was no significant interaction for dietary GL or GI for these outcomes in GOLDN. For the BPRHS population, no significant interaction was observed for IRS1 variants and dietary factors for type 2 diabetes, IFG/T2D, or MetS.\n\nHaplotype analyses for IRS1 variants\n\nMain genetic associations.\n\nFor rs7578326 and rs2943641, four haplotypes were observed in both GOLDN and the BPRHS, with the frequencies ranging from 0.016 to 0.629 in GOLDN, and from 0.056 to 0.581 in the BPRHS (Supplementary Table 2). Meta-analysis indicated that haplotype G-T carriers had lower HOMA-IR (z = 2.817, P = 0.005) and fasting insulin (z = 3.072, P = 0.002) than noncarriers (Supplementary Table 3). Haplotype A-C carriers had a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (pooled OR 1.62 [95% CI 1.10–2.38], P = 0.014), IFG/T2D (1.46 [1.06–2.01], P = 0.02), and MetS (1.46 [1.09–1.96], P = 0.012), compared with noncarriers (Supplementary Table 2). No significant heterogeneity was observed for the meta-analysis (Pheterogeneity > 0.1).\n\nHaplotype-diet interaction.\n\nFor GOLDN, haplotype G-T significantly interacted with SFA (P = 0.031), carbohydrate (P = 0.007), and the SFA-to-carbohydrate ratio (P = 0.005) on HOMA-IR (Supplementary Table 4). Haplotype G-T also significantly interacted with dietary total fat (P = 0.032), carbohydrate (P = 0.008), and the SFA-to-carbohydrate ratio (P = 0.002), influencing the risk of MetS. Haplotype A-C interacted with total fat intake (P = 0.048) and GL (P = 0.006) for risk for MetS (P = 0.048). Subjects not carrying haplotype A-C had a lower risk of MetS compared with A-C carriers when dietary GL was low (≤111.5, OR 0.38 [95% CI 0.18–0.63]), but not with high GL (>111.5, 1.36 [0.10–2.84]) (Supplementary Table 5). No interaction for type 2 diabetes or IFG/T2D was observed.\n\nFor the BPRHS, haplotype A-C marginally interacted with dietary GL for HOMA-IR (P = 0.065) and fasting insulin (P = 0.065) (data not shown). Subjects not carrying haplotype A-C had lower HOMA-IR than carriers only when dietary GL was low (≤141.2, P = 0.007), but not for high dietary GL. Haplotype A-C also interacted with dietary GI for MetS risk (P = 0.034) (Supplementary Table 4). Subjects not carrying haplotype A-C had a lower risk of MetS than A-C carriers only with low dietary GI (≤57.1, OR 0.50 [95% CI 0.28–0.87]). In addition, haplotype G-T had a marginally significant interaction with dietary carbohydrate (P = 0.051) for type 2 diabetes risk. Haplotype G-T carriers had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with noncarriers when consuming high carbohydrate (>51.5, 0.65 [0.43–1.00]), but not when consuming low carbohydrate (≤ 51.5, 1.22 [0.80–1.87]).

    "content": "Main findings of Qi et al.\n\nQi et al. found that the MetS reversion rate (proportion of subjects with MetS at baseline but reverted at 6 months or 2 years) was higher in the high-fat diet group compared with the low-fat group over the 2-year intervention in A-allele carriers at rs1522813 (P = 0.002), while no differences were found between the low- and high-fat diet groups among the GG genotype. The age-, sex-, ethnicity-, and body weight changes–adjusted odds ratio for 2-year MetS reversion for the high-fat compared with low-fat group was 2.88 (95% CI 1.25–6.67; P = 0.01) for A-allele carriers (P = 0.04 for genotype–diet interaction). These results did not change after adjustment for physical activity or changes in insulin resistance. The authors concluded that their findings provide supportive evidence for the notion of personalized dietary intervention in the management of MetS.\n\nThe study appears to be the first to examine gene–diet interactions on changes in MetS status in a large, long-term randomized dietary intervention. It represents an example of how trait responses to an intervention may be conditioned by genotype, emphasizing the importance of individual-level compared with population-level data when examining responses to standardized interventions. However, despite the positive findings and strengths of the POUNDS LOST trial, several limitations of the current study warrant further discussion.\n\nPower and sample size\n\nStatistical power and multiple testing are important considerations when evaluating genetic association studies. The authors acknowledged that they likely lacked the statistical power to detect the modest genetic associations and interactions they found for MetS reversion. In the current study, only 342 subjects had MetS at baseline and thus were eligible for analyses involving MetS reversion. Furthermore, they had a maximum sample size of 185 for the GG genotype and 157 for A-allele carriers. There was also an approximately 24% dropout from baseline to 2 years, further reducing the sample size.\n\nThe authors tested associations at two variants near IRS1 but did not account for multiple testing, as a P value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Correcting for the fact that two variants were tested would result in a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P = 0.025 for statistical significance. Furthermore, the authors conducted numerous statistical tests across many traits. The results in Table 2 show that 22 statistical tests were performed for the association of rs1522813 genotype with various traits, while Supplementary Table 1 shows 24 additional tests. It can be assumed these tests were also performed for the rs2943641 genotype, resulting in approximately 100 total statistical tests and a Bonferroni multiple testing corrected threshold of about P = 0.0005. Using this threshold, none of the reported associations in the study would be considered statistically significant.\n\nAssociation of IRS1 with metabolic traits\n\nVariants in or near the IRS1 gene have been associated with MetS and several of its components. Furthermore, several studies have reported significant genotype–diet interactions between variants in or near IRS1 and dietary factors on metabolic traits, including the POUNDS LOST study. The rs2943641 and rs1522813 variants tested by Qi et al. are located approximately 500 kb and 660 kb from IRS1, respectively, which is quite remote from the associated gene transcript. It is not clear whether these variants are in linkage disequilibrium with IRS1 variants and/or related to IRS1 function. Teslovich et al. noted that variation at rs2972146, a variant associated with metabolic traits in recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), correlated with IRS1 expression in omental fat, despite being located 495 kb away from the IRS1 gene.\n\nRecent GWAS reports have identified over 20 loci associated with MetS at the genome-wide level, a list that does not include IRS1. Although loci identified in observational GWAS are not always associated with trait responses to interventions, the inclusion of only variants near IRS1 and the modest effect sizes reported in the current study should be viewed with healthy skepticism. Furthermore, the POUNDS LOST group itself has reported elsewhere that variation in at least six different genes modulates the association between dietary composition and changes in metabolic traits. Thus, it is clear that no single gene or variant is likely responsible for interindividual differences in the response of MetS and its components to dietary interventions.\n\nOutlook for nutrigenetic studies\n\nThe article by Qi et al. represents an opportunity to discuss the conditions necessary to identify genotype–nutrition interaction effects on metabolic traits. Multiple challenges have to be met for nutrigenetic studies to be successful. First, the true magnitude of a gene–nutrition interaction effect is not likely to be revealed by observational studies. Only intervention studies in which compliance with the experimental dietary exposure is not in doubt have the potential to uncover the complex relationships between DNA sequence variants in critical genes and a given nutrient or combination of nutrients and their effects on metabolic traits of interest. Second, in studies dealing with differential exposures to macronutrients, it is a major challenge to isolate the macronutrient truly responsible for the nutrigenetic effects, particularly for fat and carbohydrates as they tend to be manipulated in such a way that one is compensated by the other. The problem is thought to be greatly diminished when the dietary exposure pertains to other nutrients. Third, the challenge relating to sample size and statistical power as emphasized above. Based on this issue alone, it is likely that the vast majority of the nutrigenetic findings reported to date are false (see reference for a discussion). It is a challenge to design large-scale human nutrigenetic experiments and an even more daunting task to get them adequately funded in the current environment, but unfortunately there is no true substitute.\n\nIn brief, it is possible that calor",

From these findings, we considered that HVDRR in this patient was caused by a homozygous nonsense mutation in the VDR.\n\nAnalysis of the genesis of homozygosity\n\nMost cases of homozygosity among rare mutations are caused by consanguinity, but the parents in this case denied consanguinity; therefore, we performed a genetic analysis of the parents. The mutation was heterozygous in the mother only, and was not present in the father (Fig 2A).\n\nTo assess the possibility of a gross deletion around the mutation in the father’s allele, we sequence-analyzed several common target SNPs in the VDR, in other genes on chromosome 12, and in other chromosomes studied in our laboratory. Table 1 shows the results of the SNPs which identify the parental origin of the proband’s allele. Two SNPs in the VDR, one near the mutation (rs10735810) and another within approximately 20 kb (rs7975232) (Fig 2B), demonstrated homozygous alleles in the proband that were derived only from the mother (Table 1). Moreover, another 2 SNPs located at the opposite end of the long arm of chromosome 12 (rs2259820, rs2464196) (Fig 2B) were also homozygous and derived only from the mother. However, SNPs on chromosomes 4 and 11 showed a normal pattern of allele inheritance from the parents. These results indicated that at least the long arm of chromosome 12 consists of alleles derived only from the mother. G-banding karyotype analysis of the proband revealed a normal 46,XX karyotype without monosomy of 12q. These findings suggested that gross deletion of the father’s allele was unlikely.\n\nNext, we assessed the biological paternity by conventional STR analysis. STRs located on chromosomes other than 12 confirmed that the father was the biological father. Interestingly, the STR of a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (vWA; 12p12-pter) showed a homozygous maternal allele (proband 19; father 14, 16; mother 16, 19). Taken together, these findings eliminated the possibility of a gross deletion and paternal discordance, and suggested that de novo mutation was unlikely. Finally, maternal UPD of the entire chromosome 12 was suggested.\n\nDetection of UPD by genome-wide SNP array\n\nFor the evaluation of UPD, we conducted a genome-wide SNP array of the proband and the parents. The overall call rates were 99.47%, 99.64%, and 99.57% for the proband, the father, and the mother, respectively. All chromosomes other than chromosome 12 showed a normal homo/heterozygous pattern. There were 29,197 SNPs on chromosome 12 on the array, of which 13,940 SNPs showed multiple genotypes among the trio of samples (proband, mother, and father). The proband was called homozygous for 13,848 SNPs and heterozygous for 92 SNPs; however, we found that these heterozygous SNPs were miss-calls caused by the genotype calling algorithms, and the proband was considered homozygous for all SNPs on chromosome 12. After linkage disequilibrium pruning (LD pruning) with 474 samples, a total of 8,933 SNPs remained, except for bad clusters. Fig 3 shows the B allele frequencies for chromosome 12, which represents the distribution of each proband, maternal, and paternal allele. On chromosome 12, the allele segregation revealed to be composed of only homozygous AA and BB combinations, and no AB combinations (loss of heterozygosity). Allele segregation of chromosome 12 showed a heterozygous pattern in her parents. In the proband’s diagram, the pink spots represent the maternal SNPs (1,514 SNPs) and the blue spots, paternal (none) (Fig 3). It was obvious that all of the homozygous SNPs on chromosome 12 derived from the mother. Moreover, the 2 alleles in the proband were 100% identical to those in the mother by identical-by-descent analysis, whereas none were identical to those in the father. The signal intensity of chromosome 12 was sufficient to conclude that the chromosome was diploid, compared with other chromosomes. Thus, we concluded that the proband had complete maternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 12 with a nonsense mutation.\n\nClinical course\n\nInitial treatment with increasing amounts of alfacalcidol up to 5 μgkg/day with oral calcium 60 mg/kg/day failed to improve her symptoms. After detecting the VDR mutation, she was admitted to another hospital for further treatment. After increasing her oral elemental calcium (calcium lactate) dose to 300 mg/kg/day (divided 3 times), her serum calcium and PTH levels improved (Fig 4A). The oral calcium was subsequently reduced to 240 mg/kg/day when high urinary calcium excretion started; the alfacalcidol dose was stopped because it was considered ineffective based on the genetic analysis. After 12 months of therapy, her laboratory data, including alkaline phosphatase levels, had normalized, her height gain improved, she started to run, and a repeat bone roent",

    "content": "Results\n\nOverall analysis strategy\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, we first gathered all T2D case-control GWAS individual-level data that were available through the EGA and dbGaP databases (i.e., Gene Environment-Association Studies [GENEVA], Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium [WTCCC], Finland–United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics [FUSION], Resource for Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging [GERA], and Northwestern NuGENE project [NuGENE]). We harmonized these cohorts, applied standardized quality control procedures, and filtered out low-quality variants and samples (Methods and Supplementary Notes). After this process, a total of 70,127 subjects (70KforT2D, 12,931 cases, and 57,196 controls, Supplementary Data 1) were retained for downstream analysis. Each of these cohorts was then imputed to the 1000G and UK10K reference panels using an integrative method, which selected the results from the reference panel that provided the highest accuracy for each variant, according to IMPUTE2 info score (Methods). Finally, the results from each of these cohorts were meta-analyzed (Fig. 1), obtaining a total of 15,115,281 variants with good imputation quality (IMPUTE2 info score ≥ 0.7, MAF ≥ 0.001, and I2 heterogeneity score < 0.75), across 12,931 T2D cases and 57,196 controls. Of these, 6,845,408 variants were common (MAF ≥ 0.05), 3,100,848 were low-frequency (0.01 ≤ MAF < 0.05), and 5,169,025 were rare (0.001 ≤ MAF < 0.01). Merging the imputation results derived from the two reference panels substantially improved the number of good-quality imputed variants, particularly within the low-frequency and rare spectrum, compared to the imputation results obtained with each of the panels separately. For example, a set of 5,169,025 rare variants with good quality was obtained after integrating 1000G and UK10K results, while only 2,878,263 rare variants were imputed with 1000G and 4,066,210 with UK10K (Supplementary Fig. 1A). This strategy also allowed us to impute 1,357,753 indels with good quality (Supplementary Fig. 1B).\n\nTo take full advantage of publicly available genetic data, we used three main meta-analytic approaches to adapt to the three most common strategies for genetic data sharing: individual-level genotypes, summary statistics, and single-case queries through the Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal (T2D Portal) (http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/). We first meta-analyzed all summary statistics results from the DIAGRAM trans-ancestry meta-analysis (26,488 cases and 83,964 controls), selecting 1,918,233 common variants (MAF ≥ 0.05), mostly imputed from HapMap, with the corresponding fraction of non-overlapping samples in our 70KforT2D set, i.e. the GERA and the NuGENE cohorts, comprising a total of 7,522 cases and 50,446 controls (Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 1). Second, the remaining variants (13,197,048), which included mainly non-HapMap variants (MAF < 0.05) or variants not tested above, were meta-analyzed using all five cohorts from the 70KforT2D resource (Supplementary Data 1). Finally, low-frequency variants located in coding regions and with p ≤ 1 × 10−4 were meta-analyzed using the non-overlapping fraction of samples with the data from the T2D Portal through the interrogation of exome array and whole-exome sequence data from ~80,000 and ~17,000 individuals, respectively.\n\nPathway and functional enrichment analysis\n\nTo explore whether our results recapitulate the pathophysiology of T2D, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis with all the variants with p ≤ 1 × 10−5 using DEPICT (Methods). This analysis showed enrichment of genes expressed in pancreas (ranked first in tissue enrichment analysis, p = 7.8 × 10−4, FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Data 2) and cellular response to insulin stimulus (ranked second in gene-set enrichment analysis, p = 3.9 × 10−8, FDR = 0.05, Supplementary Data 3, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 3), in concordance with the current knowledge of the molecular basis of T2D.\n\nIn addition, variant set enrichment analysis of the T2D-associated credible sets across regulatory elements defined in isolated human pancreatic islets showed a significant enrichment for active regulatory enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that causal SNPs within associated regions have a regulatory function, as previously reported.\n\nFine-mapping and functional characterization of T2D loci\n\nThe three association strategies allowed us to identify 57 genome-wide significant associated loci (p ≤ 5 × 10−8), of which seven were not previously reported as associated with T2D (Table 1). The remaining 50 loci have been previously reported and included, for example, two low-frequency variants recently discovered in Europeans, one located within one of the CCND2 introns (rs76895963), and a missense variant within the PAM gene. Furthermore, we confirmed that the",

The remaining 50 loci have been previously reported and included, for example, two low-frequency variants recently discovered in Europeans, one located within one of the CCND2 introns (rs76895963), and a missense variant within the PAM gene. Furthermore, we confirmed that the magnitude and direction of the effect of all the associated variants (p ≤ 0.001) were highly consistent with those reported previously (ρ = 0.92, p = 1 × 10−248, Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, the direction of effect was consistent with all 139 previously reported variants, except three that were discovered in east and south Asian populations (Supplementary Data 4).\n\nThe high coverage of genetic variation ascertained in this study allowed us to fine-map known and novel loci, providing more candidate causal variants for downstream functional interpretations. We constructed 99% credible variant sets for each of these loci, i.e. the subset of variants that have, in aggregate, 99% probability of containing the true causal variant for all 57 loci (Supplementary Data 5). As an important improvement over previous T2D genetic studies, we identified small structural variants within the credible sets, consisting mostly of insertions and deletions between 1 and 1,975 nucleotides. In fact, out of the 8,348 variants included within the credible sets for these loci, 927 (11.1%) were indels, of which 105 were genome-wide significant (Supplementary Data 6). Interestingly, by integrating imputed results from 1000G and UK10K reference panels, we gained up to 41% of indels, which were only identified by either one of the two reference panels, confirming the advantage of integrating the results from both reference panels. Interestingly, 15 of the 71 previously reported loci that we replicated (p ≤ 5.3 × 10−4 after correcting for multiple testing) have an indel as the top variant, highlighting the potential role of this type of variation in the susceptibility for T2D. For example, within the IGF2BP2 intron, a well-established and functionally validated locus for T2D, we found that 12 of the 57 variants within its 99% credible set correspond to indels with genome-wide significance (5.6 × 10−16 < p < 2.4 × 10−15), which collectively represented 18.4% posterior probability of being causal.\n\nTo prioritize causal variants within all the identified associated loci, we annotated their corresponding credible sets using the Variant Effector Predictor (VEP) for coding variants (Supplementary Data 7), and the Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) and LINSIGHT tools for non-coding variation (Supplementary Data 8 and 9). In addition, we tested the effect of all variants on expression across multiple tissues by interrogating GTEx and RNA-sequencing gene expression data from pancreatic islets.\n\nNovel T2D-associated loci driven by common variants\n\nBeyond the detailed characterization of the known T2D-associated regions, we also identified seven novel loci, among which, five were driven by common variants with modest effect sizes (1.06 < OR < 1.12; Table 1, Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 6 and 7).\n\nWithin the first novel T2D-associated locus in chromosome 1q41 (LYPLAL1-ZC3H11B, rs2820443, OR = 1.07 [1.04–1.09], p = 2.6 × 10−8), several variants have been previously associated with waist-to-hip ratio, height, visceral adipose fat in females, adiponectin levels, fasting insulin, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Among the genes in this locus, LYPLAL1, which encodes for lysophospholypase-like 1, appears to be the most likely effector gene, as it has been found to be downregulated in mouse models of diet-induced obesity and upregulated during adipogenesis.\n\nSecond, a novel locus at chromosome 9q34.2 region (ABO, rs505922, OR = 1.06 [1.04–1.09], p = 4.9 × 10−8) includes several variants that have been previously associated with other metabolic traits. For example, the variant rs651007, in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs505922 (r2 = 0.507), has been shown to be associated with fasting glucose, and rs514659 (r2 with top = 1) is associated with an increased risk for cardiometabolic disorders. One of the variants within the credible set was the single base-pair frame-shift deletion defining the blood group O. In concordance with previous results that linked O blood type with a lower risk of developing T2D, the frame-shift deletion determining the blood group type O was associated with a protective effect for T2D in our study (rs8176719, p = 3.4 × 10−4, OR = 0.95 [0.91–0.98]). In addition, several variants within this credible set are associated with the expression of the ABO gene in multiple tissues including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and pancreatic islets (Supplementary Data 9, Supplementary Data 10).\n\nThird, a novel locus at",

In addition, several variants within this credible set are associated with the expression of the ABO gene in multiple tissues including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and pancreatic islets (Supplementary Data 9, Supplementary Data 10).\n\nThird, a novel locus at chromosome 10q22.1 locus (NEUROG3/COL13A1/RPL5P26, rs2642587, OR = 1.12 [1.08–1.16], p = 8.4 × 10−9) includes NEUROG3 (Neurogenin3), which is an essential regulator of pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation. Mutations in this gene have been reported to cause permanent neonatal diabetes, but a role of this gene in T2D has not been yet reported.\n\nThe lead common variant of the fourth novel locus at chromosome 12q24.31 (rs3794205, OR = 1.07 [1.04–1.10], p = 4.1 × 10−8) lies within an intron of the CAMKK2 gene, previously implicated in cytokine-induced beta-cell death. However, other variants within the corresponding credible set could also be causal, such as a missense variant within the P2RX7, a gene previously associated with glucose homeostasis in humans and mice, or another variant (rs11065504, r2 with lead variant = 0.81) found to be associated with the regulation of the P2RX4 gene in tibial artery and in whole blood, according to GTEx (Supplementary Data 9).\n\nThe fifth novel locus driven by common variants is located within 17q21.32 (rs12453394, OR = 1.07 [1.05–1.10], p = 3.23 × 10−8). It includes three missense variants located within the CALCOCO2, SNF8, and GIP genes. GIP encodes for glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, a hormonal mediator of enteral regulation of insulin secretion. Variants in the GIP receptor (GIPR) have been previously associated with insulin response to oral glucose challenge and beta-cell function, proposing GIP as a plausible candidate effector gene of this locus.\n\nA new T2D signal driven by a low-frequency variant\n\nFurthermore, we selected all low-frequency (0.01 ≤ MAF < 0.05) variants with p ≤ 1 × 10−4 in the 70KforT2D meta-analysis that were annotated as altering protein sequences, according to VEP. This resulted in 15 coding variants that were meta-analyzed with exome array and whole-exome sequencing data from a total of ~97,000 individuals after excluding the overlapping cohorts between the different data sets. This analysis highlighted a novel genome-wide association driven by a low-frequency missense variant (Ser58Phe) within the EHMT2 gene at chromosome 6p21.33 (rs115884658, OR = 1.21 [1.14–1.29], p = 3.00 × 10−10; Fig. 2, Supplementary Figures 6 and 7). EHMT2 is involved in the mediation of FOXO1 translocation induced by insulin. Since this variant is less than 1 Mb away from HLA-DQA1, a locus reported to be associated with T2D, we performed a series of reciprocal conditional analyses and excluded the possibility that our analysis was capturing previously reported T2D or T1D signals (Supplementary Data 11). Beyond this missense EHMT2 variant, other low-frequency variants within the corresponding credible set may also be causal. For example, rs115333512 (r2 with lead variant = 0.28) is associated with the expression of CLIC1 in several tissues according to GTEx (multitissue meta-analysis p = 8.9 × 10−16, Supplementary Data 9). In addition, this same variant is associated with the expression of the first and second exon of the CLIC1 mRNA in pancreatic islet donors (p(exon 1) = 1.4 × 10−19, p(exon 2) = 1.9 × 10−13, Supplementary Data 10). Interestingly, CLIC1 has been reported as a direct target of metformin by mediating the antiproliferative effect of this drug in human glioblastoma. All these findings support CLIC1, as an additional possible effector transcript, likely driven by rs115333512.\n\nA novel rare X chromosome variant associated with T2D\n\nSimilar to other complex diseases, the majority of published large-scale T2D GWAS studies have omitted the analysis of the X chromosome, with the notable exception of the identification of a T2D-associated region near the DUSP9 gene in 2010. To fill this gap, we tested the X chromosome genetic variation for association with T2D. To account for heterogeneity of the effects and for the differences in imputation performance between males and females, the association was stratified by sex and tested separately, and then meta-analyzed. This analysis was able to replicate the DUSP9 locus, not only through the known rs5945326 variant (OR = 1.15, p = 0.049), but also through a three-nucleotide deletion located within a region with several promoter marks",

Conditional analyses showed that the originally reported variant was no longer significant (OR = 1.01, p = 0.94) when conditioning on the newly identified variant, rs61503151. On the other hand, when conditioning on the previously reported variant, rs5945326, the effect of the newly identified indel remained significant and with a larger effect size (OR = 1.33, p = 0.003), placing this deletion, as a more likely candidate causal variant for this locus (Supplementary Data 14).\n\nIn addition, we identified a novel genome-wide significant signal in males at the Xq23 locus driven by a rare variant (rs146662075, MAF = 0.008, OR = 2.94 [2.00–4.31], p = 3.5 × 10−8; Fig. 3a). Two other variants in LD with the top variant, rs139246371 (chrX:115329804, OR = 1.65, p = 3.5 × 10−5, r2 = 0.37 with the top variant) and rs6603744 (chrX:115823966, OR = 1.28, p = 1.7 × 10−4, r2 = 0.1 with the top variant), comprised the 99% credible set and supported the association. We tested in detail the accuracy of the imputation for the rs146662075 variant by comparing the imputed results from the same individuals genotyped by two different platforms (Methods) and found that the imputation was highly accurate in males only when using UK10K, but not in females, nor when using 1000G (R2[UK10K,males] = 0.94, R2[UK10K,females] = 0.66, R2[1000G,males] = 0.62, and R2[1000G,females] = 0.43; Supplementary Fig. 8). Whether this association is specific to men, or whether it also affects female carriers, remains to be clarified with datasets that allow accurate imputation on females, or with direct genotyping or sequencing.\n\nTo further validate and replicate this association, we next analyzed four independent data sets (SIGMA, INTERACT, Partners Biobank, and UK Biobank), by performing imputation with the UK10K reference panel. In addition, a fifth cohort was genotyped de novo for the rs146662075 variant in several Danish sample sets. The initial meta-analysis, including the five replication data sets did not reach genome-wide significance (OR = 1.57, p = 1.2 × 10−5; Supplementary Fig. 9A), and revealed a strong degree of heterogeneity (heterogeneity phet = 0.004), which appeared to be driven by the replication cohorts.\n\nAs a complementary replication analysis, within one of the case-control studies, there was a nested prospective cohort study, the Inter99, which consisted of 1,652 nondiabetic male subjects genotyped for rs146662075, of which 158 developed T2D after 11 years of follow-up. Analysis of incident diabetes in this cohort confirmed the association with the same allele, as previously seen in the case-control studies, with carriers of the rare T allele having increased risk of developing incident diabetes, compared to the C carriers (Cox-proportional hazards ratio (HR) = 3.17 [1.3–7.7], p = 0.011, Fig. 3b). Nearly 30% of carriers of the T risk allele developed incident T2D during 11 years of follow-up, compared to only 10% of noncarriers.\n\nTo understand the strong degree of heterogeneity observed after adding the replication datasets, we compared the clinical and demographic characteristics of the discovery and replication cohorts, and found that the majority of the replication datasets contained control subjects that were significantly younger than 55 years, the average age at the onset of T2D reported in this study and in Caucasian populations. This was particularly clear for the Danish cohort (age controls [95%CI] = 46.9 [46.6–47.2] vs. age cases [95%CI] = 60.7 [60.4–61.0]) and for INTERACT (age controls [95%CI] = 51.7 [51.4–52.1] vs. age cases [95%CI] = 54.8 [54.6–55.1]; Supplementary Fig. 10).

Given the supporting results with the Inter99 prospective cohort, we performed an additional analysis using a stricter definition of controls, to minimize the presence of prediabetics or individuals that may further develop diabetes after reaching the average age at the onset. For this, we applied two additional exclusion criteria: (i) subjects younger than 55 years and (ii), when possible, excluding individuals with measured 2- h plasma glucose values during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) above 7.8 mmol l−1, a threshold employed to identify impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes), or controls with family history of T2D, both being strong risk factors for developing T2D. While the application of the first filter alone did not yield genome-wide significant results (Supplementary Fig. 9B), upon excluding individuals with prediabetes or a family history of T2D, the replication results were significant and consistent with the initial discovery results (OR = 1.57 [1.19–2.07], p = 0.0014). The combined analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts resulted in genome-wide significance, confirming the association of rs146662075 with T2D (OR = 1.95 [1.56–2.45], p = 7.8 × 10−9, Fig. 3c).\n\nAllele-specific enhancer activity of the rs146662075 variant\n\nWe next explored the possible molecular mechanism behind this association, by using different genomic resources and experimental approaches. The credible set of this region contained three variants, with the leading SNP alone (rs146662075), showing 78% posterior probability of being causal (Supplementary Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 5), as well as the highest CADD (scaled C-score = 15.68; Supplementary Data 8), and LINSIGHT score (Supplementary Data 9). rs146662075 lies within a chromosomal region enriched in regulatory (DNase I) and active enhancer (H3K27ac) marks, between the AGTR2 (at 103 kb) and the SLC6A14 (at 150 kb) genes. The closest gene AGTR2, which encodes for the angiotensin II receptor type 2, has been previously associated with insulin secretion and resistance. From the analysis of available epigenomic data sets, we found no evidences of H3K27ac or other enhancer regulatory marks in human pancreatic islets; whereas a significant association was observed between the presence of H3K27ac enhancer marks and the expression of AGTR2 across multiple tissues (Fisher test p = 4.45 × 10−3), showing the highest signal of both H3K27ac and AGTR2 RNA-seq expression, but not with other genes from the same topologically associated domain (TAD), in fetal muscle (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Figure 11).\n\nWe next studied whether the region encompassing the rs146662075 variant could act as a transcriptional enhancer and whether its activity was allele-specific. For this, we linked the DNA region with either the T (risk) or the C (non-risk) allele, to a minimal promoter and performed luciferase assays in a mouse myoblast cell line. The luciferase analysis showed an average 4.4-fold increased activity for the disease-associated T allele, compared to the expression measured with the common C allele, suggesting an activating function of the T allele, or a repressive function of the C allele (Fig. 4b). Consistent with these findings, electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear protein extracts from mouse myoblast cell lines, differentiated myotubes, and human fetal muscle cell line, revealed sequence-specific binding activity of the C allele, but not the rare T allele (Fig. 4c). Overall, these data indicate that the risk T allele prevents the binding of a nuclear protein that is associated with decreased activity of an AGTR2-linked enhancer.",

    "content": "Results\n\nStrategy used to benchmark predictions of gene essentiality in cancer metabolism\n\nFlux balance analysis (FBA) is possibly the only modelling approach that has the potential to predict gene essentiality in cancer metabolism at the genome scale. In this study, we sought to systematically validate whether FBA can be used to determine gene essentiality in cancer cell metabolism by comparing predictions with large-scale experimental datasets (Fig. 1). Therefore, the FBA problem was formulated to scan for a feasible flux distribution that enables the simultaneous biosynthesis of all human biomass components, the so-called biomass equation, in cancers growing in defined serum-containing medium. In these conditions, the metabolic network is free to absorb any medium or serum metabolites (at any rate), which include sugars, amino acids, several metabolic intermediates and short chain fatty acids. In FBA, the emergence of a feasible flux distribution that can support biomass formation is generally limited by the introduction of constraints that can represent molecular or environmental limitations (e.g., the absence of a given enzyme in a cancer type or the unavailability of a nutrient in the microenvironment).\n\nHere, we considered two typical sets of constraints: A) the topology of the cancer specific-metabolic network; and B) a profile of experimentally measured fluxes for a number of exchange metabolites (i.e., exchange fluxes) in a panel of cancer-specific cell lines (generally more than one cell line for each type of cancer). Using either of these two constraints we predicted gene essentiality using FBA by introducing a constraint that disables flux in the univocally encoded reaction(s). This constraint is commonly referred to as in silico single-gene knockout, and the gene is essential if the in silico single-gene knockout ablates biomass production. A gene knockout ablates biomass production if there is no flux distribution that allows the biomass equation to carry a flux, or if the knockout results in a substantial flux reduction. However, a gene knockout consents biomass production if there is no change in the flux through the biomass equation. Single-gene knockout resulting in no change in biomass production is mostly explained due to one of the following reasons: 1) gene redundancy, i.e., more than one gene encodes for the reaction(s) associated with the knockout; 2) pathway redundancy, i.e., there is an alternative pathway with the same overall stoichiometry that can compensate for the knockout; or 3) the reaction(s) encoded by the knocked-out gene are not active (dead end) at the studied condition. Depending on this outcome, a gene is declared essential or nonessential in silico for a certain cancer. If constraint B) is implemented, an in silico single-gene knockout may ablate or consent biomass production, depending on which profile of exchange fluxes is used as a constraint. In this case, the corresponding gene is declared essential in silico for the cancer type only if biomass production is ablated using exchange flux profiles from at least 70% of its corresponding cancer cell lines.\n\nIn principle, the proposed approach should capture all metabolic liabilities related to biomass formation induced by the network topology and to the activation of metabolic pathways induced by the exchange flux profile of a certain cancer. At the same time, it is noteworthy that the FBA problem formulated herein will not uncover other metabolic liabilities known to be associated with cancer survival, for example, maintenance of anti-oxidant pools. To evaluate the gene essentiality predictions, we compared these to large-scale experimental data in vitro: in this case, a panel of cancer-specific cell lines derived from prostate adenocarcinoma (PC) or clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), both cultured in defined serum-containing medium. The cells were transfected with a library of siRNA oligonucleotides that target approximately 230 metabolic genes. In the PC screen, induction of caspase activity was quantified after 96 h following transfection, whereas in the ccRCC screen, reduction in cell number was monitored. If at least 70% of the cancer cell lines passed a given threshold for caspase activity or cell number reduction, then the gene was declared essential in vitro for this cancer type (or nonessential in vitro if vice versa). The accuracy of the predictions was calculated using the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and the related Fisher’s exact test statistics.\n\nAccuracy of flux balance analysis for gene essentiality in clear cell renal cell carcinoma metabolism\n\nWe decided to assess in vitro gene essentiality in the metabolism of ccRCC, as this is the most common form of kidney cancer and it exhibits a strong regulation and dependence on a reprogrammed metabolism following transformation. Additionally, we have recently shown that it features a characteristically compromised metabolic network. The reliance on specific metabolic reactions for survival suggests that this cancer may be particularly susceptible to disruptions in the metabolic network. A panel of 5 ccRCC cell lines (786-O, A498, 769-P, RCC4, and UMRC2) was transfected with a custom library of siRNA oligonucleotides targeting 230 different metabolic enzymes, transporters, and regulators involved in central carbon metabolism. For each siRNA, loss of viability was quantified by determining the mean cell number reduction relative to a negative control (non-targeting RISC-free) and a positive control (siRNA targeting ubiquitin B). The number of genes declared essential in vitro depends on the threshold chosen for the mean cell number reduction. We selected a 30% reduction for benchmarking purposes because the quantity of essential genes appears to reach a plateau at this value; note that no siRNA caused a cell number reduction greater than 50% (Supplementary Fig. 1). With this threshold, of the 217 tested siRNAs that overlap with the human metabolic network, 20 gene knockdowns caused death in at least 70% (4 of 5) of the ccRCC cell lines and were thus deemed",

With this threshold, of the 217 tested siRNAs that overlap with the human metabolic network, 20 gene knockdowns caused death in at least 70% (4 of 5) of the ccRCC cell lines and were thus deemed essential in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 2). In contrast, 136 tested siRNAs did not significantly affect cell number in at least 70% of the ccRCC cell lines and were conversely deemed nonessential in vitro (Supplementary Data 1). The remaining 61 genes were not classified, as their knockdowns had mixed effects across cell lines and therefore were not directly attributable to the ccRCC phenotype.\n\nNext, we predicted in silico gene essentiality using as the sole constraint the topology of the ccRCC metabolic network, as defined by a ccRCC genome-scale metabolic network. We identified 28 essential genes and 1,383 nonessential genes (Fig. 2A). Topology-driven gene essentiality was found to be accurate at a statistically significant level (MCC = 0.226, p = 0.043, Fig. 2B). This approach detected two true positives (i.e., candidates essential both in silico and in vitro), namely AGPAT6 and GALT (Fig. 2A); the expected number of true positives by chance is close to approximately zero ([TP] = 0.174). In this sense, we can assume that AGPAT6 and GALT represent bona fide pivotal metabolic nodes in ccRCC, regardless of the exchange fluxes, which suggests that their essentiality is due to a loss of alternative redundant metabolic pathways or genes in ccRCC. Interestingly, siRNAs corresponding to genes predicted to be essential in silico result overall in a mean cell number reduction significantly higher than that for siRNAs corresponding to genes predicted not to be essential (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig. 2C).\n\nNext, we also implemented exchange fluxes from a panel of seven ccRCC cell lines (786-O, A498, ACHN, CAK1-1, TK-10, RXF-393, and UO-31) as constraints. Using this approach, eighty-seven genes were predicted to be essential in at least 70% (5 of 7) of the cell lines (Fig. 3A). When exchange fluxes were considered, the gene essentiality prediction was found to have an increased accuracy, when compared to the in vitro data (MCC = 0.235, p = 0.010, Fig. 3B). Additionally, in this case we observed a substantial mean cell number reduction for the group of siRNAs targeting genes predicted to be essential in silico compared to those predicted to be nonessential (p < 0.001, Fig. 3C). In particular, four additional genes were identified as true positives using this approach, namely CAD, DHCR24, FDFT1, and ODC1 (Fig. 3A). It is likely that the essentiality of these genes is attributable to common metabolic requirements among ccRCC cell lines (e.g., a high lactate secretion to glucose uptake ratio or secretion of secondary metabolites), which induces dependence on the expression of enzymes that activate the related metabolic pathways. Interestingly, the accuracy of these predictions was not preserved if only exchange fluxes were considered, but the topology of the ccRCC metabolic network was neglected: we observed no significant predictive ability when the generic human metabolic network was used (MCC = 0.086, p = 0.339, Supplementary Fig. 3). The results of the accuracy achieved by FBA in these scenarios are reported in Table 1.\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that in ccRCC metabolism, FBA is able to predict gene essentiality, although to a limited degree. Gene essentiality as exposed by FBA is in turn attributable to a rewiring of the metabolic network and exchange fluxes that contribute to biomass production. Conversely, it is conceivable that the 14 genes that were found to be essential in vitro but were not captured by FBA are essential because the gene products carry out metabolic tasks that are not ascribable to the biomass production simulated here. Alternatively, it also possible that redundant pathways available in the metabolic network are not active due to the presence of regulation in vitro or in vivo that is not considered in the FBA simulations, as suggested by studies of gene deletion in yeast.\n\nAccuracy of flux balance analysis for gene essentiality in prostate adenocarcinoma metabolism\n\nWe next sought to define whether the accuracy of FBA predictions is cancer type-dependent. To this end, we used a published dataset that applied the same custom siRNA library in a panel of three prostate adenocarcinoma (PC) cell lines (LNcaP, PC3, DU145). Cell death was defined by induction of caspase activity, and we declared a gene essential in vitro if the corresponding siRNA caused apoptosis with a caspase activity z-score ≥ 2.5 (i.e., number of standard deviations from control) in at least 2 of the 3 cell lines, as adopted in the original study. Using these criteria, 14 metabolic genes were found to be essential in the PC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 4). The topology of a PC specific metabolic network was reconstructed using the same pipeline followed to generate the previously employed ccRCC genome-scale metabolic model and was used as the sole constraint to perform FBA to predict in silico gene",

The topology of a PC specific metabolic network was reconstructed using the same pipeline followed to generate the previously employed ccRCC genome-scale metabolic model and was used as the sole constraint to perform FBA to predict in silico gene essentiality. We identified 37 essential genes, whereas 1,638 genes were classified as nonessential (Supplementary Fig. 5A). We also implemented exchange fluxes from a panel of two PC cell lines, PC3 and DU145, as constraints, which resulted in the classification of 35 additional genes as essential in both these cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 5B).\n\nContrary to the results obtained for ccRCC, the accuracy of FBA predictions in PC was considerably lower when using metabolic network topology as the sole constraint (MCC = 0.082, p = 0.233, Supplementary Fig. 6A), and even worsened with the implementation of exchange fluxes (MCC = 0.039, p = 0.635, Supplementary Fig. 6C). However, when only topology was used, we observed a slightly higher mean caspase activity for the group of siRNAs targeting genes predicted to be essential in silico (p = 0.011, Supplementary Fig. 6B); this did not hold when exchange fluxes were also used as constraints (p = 0.152, Supplementary Fig. 6D). The results of the accuracy achieved by FBA in these scenarios are reported in Table 1. Interestingly, most genes predicted to be essential in silico participate in the biosynthesis of steroids. In particular, the two true positive genes detected by FBA, MVD and NSDHL, belong to this pathway. The inefficacy of exchange fluxes to unveil additional liabilities may be due to the low number of flux profiles available as constraints for PC (only 2 cell lines), as opposed to ccRCC (7 cell lines). However, it is also possible that the altered exchange fluxes in PC cells fuel pathways other than those required for biomass production and are therefore not captured by the FBA model used here. One of these pathways could indeed involve the synthesis of cholesterol for the production of steroid hormones, which play a major role in the development of PC.\n\nThese results suggest that contrary to ccRCC, FBA fails to accomplish acceptable predictions of gene essentiality in PC metabolism. This may reflect the fact that PC cells are more robust in the task of synthesising biomass components. In support of this, Ros and colleagues identified a metabolic liability in PC that does not relate to biomass formation, but is involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, ccRCC metabolism could represent an ideal situation for the identification of metabolic liabilities using FBA because of its highly compromised metabolic network.\n\nEffect of the medium metabolites on the accuracy of flux balance analysis predictions\n\nIn FBA, the definition of metabolites available for uptake is a decisive constraint for the prediction of gene essentiality. In simulations with microorganisms, the list of metabolites available for uptake mirrors the medium composition used in the controlled experimental setup. Because human cancer cell lines are normally cultured in serum-containing medium, the list of 150 metabolites adopted so far may potentially contain a large number of compounds that can be utilised in silico even though they are not utilised in any metabolic reactions by cells in vitro (e.g., bilirubin). To explore the extent to which the medium composition affects the accuracy of FBA predictions, we repeated all simulations using Ham’s medium, a nutrient poor medium adopted in previous studies to predict in silico gene essentiality of cancer cells. This less permissive medium decreases the availability of alternative pathways. Thus, the number of essential genes predicted in silico increases for both ccRCC (Supplementary Fig. 7) and PC (Supplementary Fig. 8), when only the topology is used as a constraint and when exchange fluxes are also considered. However, these genes were mostly not found to be essential in vitro, and therefore the accuracy of the FBA predictions was lower for all four scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 9). We conclude that a broader definition of the medium improves FBA simulations in human systems and reduces the number of false negatives (i.e., genes essential in silico but not in vitro) induced by incorrect assumptions regarding the unavailability of certain metabolites to the cells. The results of the accuracy achieved by FBA in these scenarios are reported in Table 1.\n\nEffect of the choice for the cell death threshold in vitro on the accuracy of flux balance analysis predictions\n\nGiven that the definition of gene essentiality in vitro depends on the threshold selected for cell death (namely the mean cell number reduction in the ccRCC screen and the caspase activity z-score in the PC screen), we performed a sensitivity analysis on these thresholds for all tested scenarios (implemented constraints, cancer types, and medium definition). In the case of ccRCC, we observed a positive relationship between the accuracy of FBA predictions and the strictness of the definition of the threshold for cell death, at least up to the point where the number of essential genes in vitro is less than 10, which occurs for mean cell number reduction >40% (Supplementary Fig. 10). This trend was conserved in all scenarios, with the highest accuracy being achieved when using the topology of the ccRCC metabolic network in a serum-containing medium as the sole constraint to perform FBA; the lowest accuracy was observed when constraining the exchange fluxes in Ham’s medium. In the case of PC, the above trend was",

In the case of PC, the above trend was not observed for any scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 11). In particular, the accuracy of predictions was not noticeably different from a random predictor. Taken together, this indicates that the accuracy of in silico predictions is significant in ccRCC (but not in PC) for a reasonable range of thresholds upon which a gene is declared essential in vitro.\n\nEffect of cancer cell line exchange fluxes on the inference of gene essentiality in a certain cancer\n\nBecause FBA proved powerful in exposing the metabolic liabilities of ccRCC, we decided to validate some of the in silico predictions of gene essentiality. In particular, we tested the extent to which exchange fluxes from ccRCC cell lines can be used to infer gene essentiality attributable to the ccRCC phenotype. To this end, we selected some genes that were differentially classified as essential depending on the cell line flux profile, but still classified as essential in ccRCC according to a consensus outcome, i.e., essential in >70% of cell lines. We chose to test the predictions for GCLC, GSS, SLC7A9 (considered essential in silico for ccRCC because they were classified as such in 5 of the 7 cell lines), and PNP (considered nonessential in silico for ccRCC because it was classified as such in 3 of the 7 cell lines). In addition, we tested UMPS and RRM2B, which were deemed essential in silico for all ccRCC cell lines upon implementation of every exchange flux profile. Next, the corresponding genes were silenced in five of the seven cell lines whose exchange fluxes were used to constrain the FBA predictions (786-O, A498, CAKI-1, TK10, and UO31). In accordance with the threshold for cell death adopted above, a gene was declared essential in vitro for ccRCC if more than 70% of cell lines tested (e.g., at least 4 of 5) exhibited at least 30% mean cell number reduction compared to control (Fig. 4).\n\nAt the level of gene essentiality in ccRCC, the consensus predictions for RRM2B, GCLC, UMPS, and GSS were confirmed in vitro. However, PNP and SLC7A9 knockouts showed mixed effects across cell lines in vitro. Hence, the essentiality of these genes in ccRCC could not be inferred from this experiment. Overall, this result suggests that ccRCC cell line exchange fluxes can entail some common metabolic requirements associated with the ccRCC phenotype, which can be exploited to predict gene essentiality in ccRCC metabolism. However, the exchange flux measurements appear to be insufficient per se to achieve reliable predictions for a specific cell line. Indeed, we observe that only 17 of the 30 individual predictions were replicated in vitro if the cell-line-specific exchange fluxes were used for the prediction of essentiality for the corresponding cell line.\n\nCharacterisation of gene essentiality in ccRCC metabolism\n\nFBA exposed some metabolic liabilities in ccRCC that are unlikely to have been predicted by chance. Therefore, we sought to characterise those genes that were classified in this study as essential in silico and validated in vitro. This list includes ten metabolic genes: AGPAT6, CAD, DHCR24, FDFT1, GALT, GCLC, GSS, ODC1, RRM2B, and UMPS. First, we predicted whether these gene knockouts would be toxic for the execution of essential metabolic functions, i.e., whether the in silico gene knockouts compromise the metabolism of normal cell types. As previously described, we simulated the essentiality of these genes in 83 normal cell types by checking whether 56 primary metabolic tasks (e.g., synthesis of cholesterol or oxidative phosphorylation) could be carried out in silico upon application of the corresponding in silico gene knockout. In all normal cell types, the simulation revealed that knockout of CAD or UMPS ablates the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines, while FDFT1 and DHCR24 knockouts impede the production of cholesterol in normal human cell types (Fig. 5A). However, the remaining 6 genes had only minor toxic effects (in < 50% of cell types), and can thus be regarded as nontoxic to normal cells.\n\nNext, we specifically checked the toxicity of these gene knockouts in tubular kidney cells, where ccRCC is thought to originate from. In this case, the in silico knockout of ODC1 was found to be toxic because it impaired seven essential metabolic tasks in normal kidney cells. On the contrary, AGPAT6, GALT, GCLC, GSS, and RRM2B knockouts did not compromise any metabolic task and can thus be considered as selectively essential in ccRCC (Fig. 5B). To test the quality of these predictions, we ablated GCLC, GSS, RRM2B, and UMPS in an immortalised, non-tumourigenic kidney epithelial cell line (HK-2) using RNAi. These four genes were not part of the siRNA screening library but were predicted by FBA to be essential both in silico and in vitro. In accordance with the in silico predictions of toxicity, we observed cell death when UMPS was knocked out in HK",

In accordance with the in silico predictions of toxicity, we observed cell death when UMPS was knocked out in HK-2 cells, while GCLC, GSS, and RRM2B knockouts caused a minor cell number reduction, above the adopted threshold for cell death (Fig. 5C).\n\nSubsequently, we attempted to elucidate the putative mechanisms at the flux level underlying the essentiality of the AGPAT6, GALT, GCLC, GSS, and RRM2B genes, which were predicted to be toxic to none or only to a few of the normal human cell types, and in particular were predicted to be nontoxic to tubular kidney cells. AGPAT6 and GALT were found to be essential when using the topology of the ccRCC metabolic network as the sole constraint for FBA, which is indicative of a loss of pathway redundancy in key steps involved in biomass synthesis. In the human metabolic network, the AGPAT6-encoded reaction, i.e., the conversion of glycerol-3-phosphate to 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate, is associated with additional isoenzymes, AGPAT9, GPAT2, and GPAM. However, according to the Human Protein Atlas, which supported the reconstruction of the ccRCC metabolic network, AGPAT6 is the only member of the family of lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase genes appreciably expressed in ccRCC. Therefore, when AGPAT6 is knocked out, the production of glycerolipids, which is required for biomass production, becomes unfeasible (Fig. 6A), making AGPAT6 an essential gene in ccRCC.\n\nRegarding GALT, this enzyme is pivotal in the ccRCC metabolic network because it catalyses the second step of the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism (conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose). Examination of the flux space in ccRCC revealed that this reaction fuels the production of UDP-glucose, which is needed for the biosynthesis of glycogen. Knockout of GALT thus results in growth ablation due to the inability to produce glycogen, here considered to be an essential biomass component. This pathway can be bypassed via UGP2, which condenses glucose-1-phosphate with UTP to yield UDP-glucose, but UGP2 is not expressed in ccRCC (Fig. 6B). The essentiality of GALT in ccRCC is determined by the inactivity of this parallel pathway; this represents an example of loss of redundancy within the topology of the metabolic network.\n\nThe three additional genes, GCLC, GSS, and RRM2B, were classified as essential only when constraints on exchange fluxes were implemented. Their essentiality is likely to be due to a loss of redundancy in the ccRCC network when metabolite fluxes are constrained by measured uptake and secretion rates. To explore how the fluxes were distributed before the implementation of the exchange fluxes, we relieved each of these constraints one at the time until biomass production was restored, thereby allowing us to associate gene essentiality with a particular exchange flux. We found that RRM2B is associated with the flux of 3-ureidopropionate, a product of the uracil degradation pathway, which is secreted by all ccRCC cell lines (range: 0.016 to 0.102 fmol cell−1 h−1) (Fig. 6C, left). This secretion rate is not matched by the uptake rate of either of its two precursors, uracil and deoxyuridine (range: 0.003 to 0.016 and 0.010 to 0.041 fmol cell−1 h−1, respectively). Thus, it is necessary for cells to activate a flux to degrade UDP to sustain the given 3-ureidopropionate secretion rate, and one of these steps is catalysed by RRM2B. According to the Human Protein Atlas, the two other genes associated with this step (namely RRM1 and RRM2) are not expressed in ccRCC, and thus they cannot compensate for this flux if RRM2B is knocked out, making RRM2B essential.\n\nIn the case of GCLC and GSS, the essentiality is associated with the secretion of glutamate, which occurs at remarkably high rates (approximately 4 to 50 fmol cell−1 h−1) in ccRCC cell lines. The analysis of the ccRCC flux space unveiled that elevated rates of extracellular glutamate accumulation derive from the catabolism of extracellular glutathione (GSH) carried out by different gamma-glutamyl transferases. Indeed, the reconstructed ccRCC metabolic network does not include alternative pathways that support the secretion of glutamate, such as the xC– system. Despite the evidence that the xC– system, an antiporter responsible for cystine uptake via a 1:1 exchange with glutamate, is expressed in the kidney, no evidence for the encoding gene, SLC7A11, is reported at the protein level by the Human Protein Atlas; it was therefore not included in the reconstructed network. In the absence of alternative pathways, the only flux distribution returned by FBA that fits glutamate secretion requires the cleavage of extracellular GSH. This is in turn dependent on the secretion of de novo synthesised intracellular GSH, which",

    "content": "ine uptake via a 1:1 exchange with glutamate, is expressed in the kidney, no evidence for the encoding gene, SLC7A11, is reported at the protein level by the Human Protein Atlas; it was therefore not included in the reconstructed network. In the absence of alternative pathways, the only flux distribution returned by FBA that fits glutamate secretion requires the cleavage of extracellular GSH. This is in turn dependent on the secretion of de novo synthesised intracellular GSH, which is catalysed by GSS and GCLC (Fig. 6D, right). The genes are therefore classified as essential to support this flux distribution. At the same time, GSH is also utilised to reduce peroxides/reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this process, GSH is oxidised and dimerises with another moiety to form GSSG, which can be catalytically recycled to GSH. Therefore, this flux distribution also includes the expected role of GSH in ROS detoxification. Overall, FBA was able to predict a model that associates the essentiality of GSS and GCLC to the observed secretion of glutamate. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that model incompleteness (attributable to a lack of functional gene annotation in the metabolic network, as in the case of SLC7A11 in ccRCC) may be a factor that affects the reliability of this prediction, as recognised in earlier works on FBA predicted gene essentiality.",

Those having ED were older (48.2 yrs vs. 43.5 yrs, p<0.001), and more likely to smoke (24.8% vs. 16.6%, p=0.040). Those with ED had higher hemoglobin A1c at DCCT baseline (9.0 vs. 8.6, p=0.016) and higher DCCT/EDIC mean hemoglobin A1c (8.6 vs. 8.0, p<0.001).\n\nMultiple models were generated based on previous work and tested for trend and genotypic models, M1 and M2 (Table 2,3). The univariate trend model had the most statistically significant values.\n\nBoth the unadjusted trend model and the M1 model implicated a novel SNP associated with ED pathogenesis in men with type 1 diabetes, in or near Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (ALCAM) on chromosome 3 (Table 3). The G allele of rs1920201 with minor allele frequency (MAF)=0.245 was associated with increased risk of ED in the univariate trend model (p=8.6e-07). Similar borderline significant results were obtained for rs9810233, ~25 kb away, (p=6.98e-07). Further, the G risk allele was also implicated in the multivariate model for SNPs rs1920201 (OR=2.26, 95% CI 1.63–3.14, p=9.4 × 10−7 and SNP rs9810233 (OR=2.32, 95% CI 1.67–3.22, p=5.9 × 10−7). Although no SNPs achieved genome-wide significance (p <1×10−8), the Manhattan Plot (Figure 2) revealed several signals of interest, such as ALCAM.\n\nWe also performed a candidate gene approach according to the a priori derived candidate genes highlighted in supplemental Table 1 (url: https://edic.bsc.gwu.edu/).

In both cohorts, comparison between T2D patients with and without DN revealed a significant difference in male-to-female ratio, smoking and obesity parameters. Interestingly, when patients from cohort-I were compared to patients from cohort-II, a male-to-female ratio, religion status, diet, alcohol intake, smoking, obesity, education, occupation economic and habitat statuses were found significantly different for T2D without DN cases (Table 1). Overall, patients with Hindu and Muslim religions, non-vegetarian diet, non-obese, educated (graduate or above), salaried job and living in urban areas were significantly more in cohort-II than cohort-I (Table 1).\n\nGenotype frequencies of all eNOS and MCP-1 variants in control participants were in agreement with HWE. The power of the study was more than 80% for all the studied variants in two cohorts.\n\nAssociation of eNOS variants in T2D with DN\n\nThe minor allele frequency of all the three eNOS variants was higher in T2D with DN cases compared to controls in both cohorts (Table 2 and Table 3). The rs2070744 TC + CC genotypes conferred 1.7–2.0-fold risk for DN in both the studied cohorts. The rs1799983 GT + TT and GT genotypes were significantly associated with the risk of DN (1.5–1.7-fold) in both cohorts. For rs869109213, genotypes aa and ba conferred 4.2 and 1.8-fold risk towards DN in cohort-I and cohort-II, respectively (Table 3).\n\nAssociation of eNOS Variants in T2D Without DN\n\nAmong T2D cases except for rs869109213, minor allele frequency of rs1799983 and rs2070744 was higher in cases as compared to controls (Tables 2 and 3). In cohort-I, rs2070744 TC + CC and TC genotypes were significantly associated with 1.5-fold T2D risk. No significant association of rs2070744 genotypes was observed in cohort-II. The rs1799983 GT + TT and GT genotypes were significantly associated with T2D (1.6-fold) risk in cohort-II, while in cohort-I no association was observed. For rs869109213, no significant association was observed with T2D in both cohorts (Table 3).\n\nAssociation of MCP-1 Variants in T2D with DN\n\nFrequency of rs1024611 G allele was higher in T2D with DN cases from both cohorts compared to T2D without DN and controls (Tables 2 and 4). MCP-1 rs1024611 G allele provided a risk towards DN in both cohorts. In cohort-I, rs1024611 genotypes AG + GG and GG conferred approximately 1.5–2.6-fold risk for DN. In cohort-II, rs1024611 AG + GG genotypes provided 1.7-fold risk towards DN. For rs3917887, ID + DD genotypes conferred 1.8–2.0-fold risk for DN in both cohorts (Table 4).\n\nAssociation of MCP-1 Variants in T2D Without DN\n\nMCP-1 rs1024611 G allele provided a protection for T2D development in cohort-I. However, no significant association was observed in cohort-II. In the case of MCP-1 rs3917887, ID + DD and ID genotypes provided 1.5–1.7-fold risk towards T2D development in both cohorts (Table 4).\n\nAssociation of eNOS Haplotypes\n\nThe frequency of haplotype T-b-G was significantly higher in controls in comparison to DN cases and provided 1.6-fold protection towards DN in both cohorts. In cohort-I, C-b-T haplotype gave 2.9-fold risk for DN progression. In cohort-II, haplotype C-a-T (with all variant alleles) conferred 3.3–3.9-fold risk towards T2D and DN (Table 5). Based on the measure of LD, no significant results were observed between the eNOS variants in both cohorts (D′ < 0.5).\n\nAssociation of MCP-1 Haplotypes\n\nIn MCP-1 haplotype distribution, the frequency of haplotype G-D (containing variant alleles) was significantly higher in DN group compared to other groups. G-D haplotype provided 2.0–3.8-fold risk for DN and 1.6–2.7-fold risk for T2D progression in both cohorts. Haplotype A-I conferred a protection against DN in cohort-II, while haplotype G-I provided a protection towards T2D development in cohort-I (Table 5). The selected variants of MCP-1 were not in LD in both cohorts (D′ < 0.5).\n\nGenotype–Phenotype Interactions\n\nThe phenotype–genotype interaction was carried out to understand the effect of observed genotypes of eNOS and MCP-1 genetic variants on the different covariates presented previously (Raina et al.) and in this paper. Among all the variants tested in this study, the eNOS rs1799983 (TT) genotype was associated with lower and higher median of BMI and creatinine levels, respectively, compared to GG and GT genotypes of rs1799983 variant (Fig. 1). eNOS rs2070744 (CC) genotype was associated with higher median",

However, in the case of MCP-1 rs3917887, II genotype was significantly associated with lower median of random sugar levels compared to DD and ID genotypes of the rs3917887 variant (Fig. 1). \n\nMeta-Analysis\n\nThe results of the meta-analysis for the associations of eNOS and MCP-1 variants with T2D and DN susceptibility are depicted in Fig. 2. Due to the fact that MCP-1 rs3917887 had a limited number of studies, it was excluded from the meta-analysis. In T2D with DN cases, all eNOS variants conferred risk towards DN progression under the allele contrast model (Fig. 2, Table 6). In T2D without DN cases, eNOS rs2070744 and rs869109213 increased risk for T2D (Fig. 3, Table 6). For MCP-1 rs1024611 variant, no significant association was observed for both T2D and DN. The significant heterogeneity was observed only in the case of MCP-1 rs1024611, which could be due to less number of studies included in the meta-analysis. No publication bias was observed for any variant in the allele contrast model. The studies included in the meta-analysis are given in Supplementary Table 2.",

    "content": "Results\n\nBaseline Characteristics and Genotyping\n\nThe overall study consisted of 108 study participants after exclusions for lack of genotyping consent (n=9) and incomplete genotype data (n=3). Genotyping success rate of the 4 SNPs chosen to define the FADS1/2 haplotype as described in Methods, was between 96.7% and 98.3%. Minor allele frequencies were in the range of 25.0% to 32.9%. The genotype distribution for each SNP did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p >0.05).\n\nBaseline characteristics for the Healthy Eating diet group (n = 54) and the Mediterranean diet group (n = 54) were summarized in Table 1. No significant differences were found in minor allele frequency of any SNP, gender, race, age, or BMI between the two diet groups at baseline. Likewise, baseline measurements of AA, EPA, and long chain n-3 fatty acids (the sum of EPA and DHA) did not differ significantly in the serum or the colonic mucosa between the two diet groups (Table 1).\n\nBaseline measures\n\nLinear regression analysis indicated that the number of minor alleles was a significant predictor of baseline serum AA concentration (p < 0.001) and almost significant for colonic AA concentration (p = 0.058). A greater number of minor alleles was significantly associated with lower AA concentration in serum. Dietary AA intakes were not a significant predictor of either serum of colon concentrations. For long chain n-3 fatty acids, however, the situation was the reverse. Dietary intake of long chain n-3 fatty acids was a significant predictor of baseline serum long chain n-3 concentration (p < 0.001) and colonic long chain n-3 concentration (p = 0.044) while the number of minor alleles was not a significant predictor of either.\n\nSubsequent analyses were done categorizing subjects into two groups by presence or absence of any minor alleles in the FADS gene cluster. The only dietary or demographic factor to differ by genotype at baseline was BMI, which was lower in carriers of any minor alleles (mean of 27.8, SD 3.7, in all major allele carriers and mean of 26.1, SD 3.6, in carriers of any minor alleles, p=0.02 by the 2-sided t-test). Age was not significantly different (p=0.11) but was retained as a covariate. No significant difference was found for other demographic characteristics (race, gender, smoking, common medication use) between minor allele and all major allele carriers. Results were similar when using any one SNP individually versus all minor SNPS (not shown).\n\nSerum and colon fatty acid concentrations at baseline by genotype group are shown in Table 2. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate differences between genotype groups. The presence of any minor alleles was highly significantly associated with baseline serum 20:4, n-6 concentrations (p<0.0001) and 18:3, n-3 concentration (p=0.01), and marginally significant for colonic 20:4, n-6 concentration (p = 0.07), with adjustment for age, BMI, and dietary intakes of n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA and/or long chain n-3 PUFA as a percentage of energy. Specifically, mean serum 20:4, n-6 concentration (% of total fatty acids) for minor allele carriers were estimated to be 2% (95% CI = [1%, 3%]) lower, whereas mean serum 18:3, n-3 concentration for minor allele carriers were estimated to be 21% (95% CI = [4%, 41%]) higher, compared to those individuals with all major alleles in the four SNPs in FADS. There was no significant association of genotype with EPA nor with long chain n-3 fatty acids (the sum of EPA and DHA). Genotype group also had no significant effects on total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, insulin, glucose, and CRP with p>0.11 in each case (not shown).\n\nEffects of Dietary Intervention on Fatty Acid Intakes and Fatty Acid Concentrations in Serum and Colon\n\nWe first evaluated changes in fatty acids by diet group assignment alone without considering the genotype groups. Table 3 displays dietary intakes, serum, and colon fatty acid concentrations for the two diet arms at baseline and after 6 months of intervention. Based on data from food records and 24-hour recalls, dietary intakes of saturated fats (SFA) and monounsaturated fats (MUFA) were significantly reduced (p<0.0001) and long chain n-3 PUFA was significantly increased (p=0.004) in the Healthy Eating group after 6 months. The decrease in mean SFA resulted in an increased polyunsaturated fat: saturated fat ratio from 0.60 to 0.92 in the Healthy Eating group (p=0.008 from mixed linear regression models controlling for age). In the Mediterranean group, dietary intakes of SFA and n-6 PUFA both significantly decreased (p<0.0001), while MUFA and long chain n-3 PUFA significantly increased (p<0.0001), in accord with the counseling goals. The mean polyunsaturated fat: saturated fat ratio increased non-significantly from 0.72 to 0.77 in the Mediterranean group.\n\nSerum 18:2 n-6 significantly decreased (p=0.02), and both MUFA and n-3 PUFA significantly increased (p=0.0005 and p=0.01, respectively) in the Mediterranean arm only (Table 3).

There was little change in colon fatty acid concentrations. The only significant change was for long chain n-3 PUFA that significantly increased in both Healthy Eating (p=0.01) and Mediterranean groups (p=0.01).\n\nInteractions of Genotype and Diet Intervention\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show the raw means in each group over time. Table 4 shows the linear mixed model results for the analysis of the genotype by diet interaction. There was a significant interaction of genotype by diet for 20:4, n-6 (AA) concentrations in the colon (p=0.004). No significant genotype-by-diet interactions were found for AA in serum nor for EPA. Among subjects with no minor alleles, mean colon AA concentrations were estimated to be 16% (95% CI = [5%, 26%]) lower for the Mediterranean arm than the Healthy Eating arm at 6 months. These results indicate that after adjusting for baseline AA concentrations, mean colon AA concentrations at 6 months were significantly different between diet arms only in persons with no minor alleles in the FADS1/2 gene cluster. This was mainly due to an increase in colon AA in the Healthy Eating diet arm while colon AA concentrations remained fairly constant in the Mediterranean group.",

In addition, a number of men (n = 783) in ULSAM also had data available on genotype and desaturase activity assessed in adipose tissue. The correlation between the estimated enzyme activity in CE and AT was low to moderate for D5D (r = 0.36, p < 0.0001), D6D (r = 0.10, p = 0.098) and SCD (r = 0.40, p < 0.0001).\n\n3.1. GWAS of Desaturase Activity\n\nQuantile-quantile plots of p-values from the single variant association test of the enzyme activities showed no systematic deviation from the null (data not shown). Variation in one locus (fatty acid desaturase 1, FADS1) was associated with D5D and variants in or near three loci were associated with D6D (fatty acid desaturase 2, FADS2; pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase domain containing 1, PDXDC1/N-terminal asparagine amidase, NTAN1; and near melanocortin 4 receptor, MC4R) (Figures S1 and S2). The significant lead variant for CE-D5D was also significant when analyzed in AT (Figure 1), unlike D6D, where no signal could be seen in AT (Table 2). No locus was significantly associated with CE-SCD (Figure S3) but one variant close to SCD, in polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1 (PKD2L1), was significantly associated with AT-SCD, which was analyzed in ULSAM (Table 2). The same direction of effect was seen for CE-SCD, though the association was weaker (P = 1.6 × 10−4). \n\nBy conditional association tests of the FADS1-FADS2-FADS3 region, in a forward selection approach, two SNPs (rs174549, rs968567) were independently associated with CE-D5D and two SNPs (rs138194593, rs2072113) were independently associated with CE-D6D (Table S2). The four SNPs were not in strong LD (R2 ≤ 0.40) with each other.\n\n3.2. SNP Lookup\n\nDatabase searches revealed that the variants independently associated with D5D activity are located in transcription factor binding regions (cited in RegulomeDB) and have been associated with expression of FADS1 and FADS2 in diverse tissues (cited in GTEx). In previous GWAS, the two SNPs independently associated with D5D (or variants in full LD) have been linked to circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids. In studies utilizing candidate SNP approaches, the same SNPs have been associated with FA and ratios thereof in circulation and tissue.\n\nThe lead variant associated with estimated D6D activity, rs138194593, is located in an intronic region of the FADS2 gene and has been associated with FADS2 expression in blood from Estonian coronary artery disease patients. The second independent D6D-associated SNP in the FADS2 gene, rs2072113, or proxies in full LD have been associated to FADS expression (as cited in GTEx) and been linked to circulating PUFA in previous GWAS. Another variant linked with D6D activity, rs6498540, is located in PDXDC1 and has been associated with circulating PUFA and FA ratios.\n\nIn addition, rs6498540 is in perfect LD with rs4500751, a SNP in a transcription binding region (as cited in RegulomeDB) close to PDXDC1 and NTAN1 that has been associated with circulating PUFA and ratios thereof in previous GWAS. This SNP is also located 300 kb from PLAG10, a gene involved in phospholipid metabolism, possibly with a fatty-acid specific mechanism. The top SNP of the third locus associated with D6D activity, rs9957425, is not in strong LD with other SNPs (r2 < 0.32) and is not likely in a transcript factor binding region but may affect epigenetic modifications (as cited in RegulomeDB). It has not yet been associated with circulating FA or FA ratios and has not been strongly associated (p ≥ 0.02) with any traits in the GWAS included in the Metabolomic GWAS scanner or PhenoScanner. The variant is located 576 kb downstream of MC4R, in close proximity to a region strongly associated with diabetes and related traits.\n\nThe variant associated with AT-SCD, rs603424 in the PKLD1 gene, is located 31 kb from the SCD gene and has previously been associated with adipose SCD expression and circulating saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and ratios thereof.\n\n3.3. Associations of Identified Loci with Metabolic Traits\n\nAfter correcting for multiple testing, the lead SNP at one of the loci significantly associated with estimated D6D activity, rs9957425, was associated with BMI (p = 7.4 × 10−4) and plasma triglycerides (p = 2.1 × 10−3) in a meta-analysis of ULSAM and PIVUS data (Table 3).

The pairwise linkage disequilibrium maps of GIP and GIPR variants are shown in Supplementary Figure 1, and the subject characteristics are shown in Table 1.\n\nAs shown in Table 2, we observed that SNPs in GIP exhibited only borderline associations with fat distribution indices, including VFA, SFA and the VFA/SFA ratio. Specifically, rs11650936 was associated with the VFA/SFA ratio before adjusting for BMI (P=0.048), whereas the C allele of rs4794008 also tended to be associated with an increased VFA and VFA/SFA ratio after adjusting for BMI (P=0.050 and P=0.054, respectively). In contrast, minor associations between rs11671664 in GIPR were observed for VFA and SFA before adjusting for BMI (P=0.018 and P=0.020, respectively). The previously reported GIPR SNP rs11671664 was related to BMI and WC as expected, whereas rs12941604 of GIP showed a slight association with WC (P range, 0.0043–0.0184).\n\nBecause of the heterogeneity in adiposity function and adipose deposits between males and females, we also performed a subgroup analysis stratified by gender (shown in Table 3). rs4794008 of GIP was associated with the VFA/SFA ratio without or with adjustment of the BMI in male subjects (P=0.040 and P=0.041, respectively). The other two SNPs, rs9904288 and rs2291725, of GIP were associated with SFA after adjustment of the BMI in males (P=0.004 and P=0.029, respectively). Regarding the GIPR SNPs, rs11671664 was associated with VFA before BMI adjustment in males (P=0.030). In contrast, only rs11671664 of GIPR showed a slight association with SFA in female subjects (P=0.049). However, we failed to identify any gender interaction of these variants for distribution traits.\n\nAssociation with glucose metabolism traits\n\nIn terms of glucose-related traits, rs9904288 of GIP was the most significant SNP among GIP variants and was associated with a range of glucose metabolism traits (shown in Table 4). The SFA-increasing allele rs9904288 was associated with decreased 2 h glucose and 2 h insulin levels and an elevated insulinogenic index and insulin sensitivity (assessed with the Gutt index) (P range, 0.014–0.049), whereas the rs4794008 SNP of GIP showed a nominal association with VFA in males and no association with glucose-related traits. Compared to the tag SNPs of GIP, rs2287019 and rs11671664 of GIPR were associated with the glucose and insulin levels, the insulinogenic index and the Gutt index (P range, 9.46 × 10−5–0.028).\n\nGene–gene epistasis\n\nTo avoid overlooking the heritability of obesity traits due to unknown interactions between GIP and GIPR variants, we performed gene–gene interaction (epistasis) analyses. The results showed that rs4794008 of GIP and rs2287019 of GIPR exhibited significant epistatic effects on SFA in all subjects and in female subjects using the genotypic model (P=0.0313 and P=0.0178, respectively) (Figure 1).",

Analysis of a gene gain/loss tree of 70 animal species through the Ensembl Compara utility indicated that a single G6PC gene is present in the Drosophila genome, whereas lamprey (Petromyzon marinus, Cyclostomata) displays two genes and most bony fishes, birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals have at least three paralogs. Possibly due to gene loss, no G6PC gene is described in the two Tunicata genomes included in the Ensembl Compara dataset.\n\nOverall, these observations suggest that the first duplication of an ancestral G6PC gene occurred during the vertebrate/invertebrate split and a second duplication took place either in the ancestor of all Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates) or in the ancestor of bony vertebrates (i.e. after the split of bony and cartilaginous fishes). To more precisely map these duplication events, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using protein sequence information for the animal species included in the Ensembl database plus additional organisms selected to resolve the timing of the duplication events (Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S1). Results indicated that arthropods, mollusks, and echinoderms display one single G6PC gene, with the only exception of Limulus polyphemus, which has two highly similar genes suggesting a recent duplication event in this lineage. One G6PC gene is also observed in the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii. No G6PC gene was identified in the genomes of tunicates and cephalochordates, suggesting lineage-specific losses. \n\nAnalysis of the G6PC phylogeny indicated that an initial duplication event in the lineage basal to all vertebrates originated G6PC3 and the G6PC/G6PC2 ancestor. In lamprey, one of the two G6PC sequences clusters with G6PC3 proteins, whereas the other is basal to G6PC2 and G6PC (Fig. 1), suggesting that the duplication events that originated G6PC and G6PC2 occurred after the split of gnathostomes and cyclostomes but before the divergence of cartilaginous and bony fishes, as the three Callorhinchus milii sequences (the elephant shark) indicate (Fig. 1).\n\nEvolutionary analysis of the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) catalytic subunit gene family in mammals\n\nWe next analyzed in detail the evolutionary history of the three genes encoding G6Pases in eutherian mammals. To this aim, coding sequence information for ~64 species were retrieved (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). Specifically, all available sequences with good coverage were retrieved for the study. The rat sequence was not included for G6PC2, as the gene is non functional in this rodent species. GARD (genetic algorithm recombination detection) detected no recombination breakpoint in any alignment. To obtain an estimate of the extent of functional constraint acting on these genes, we calculated the average non-synonymous substitution/synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS, also referred to as ω) using the single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) method. As is the case for most mammalian genes, dN/dS was always lower than 1 (Table 1), indicating that purifying selection is the major force shaping diversity at mammalian G6Pase genes. Indeed, analysis based on the fixed effects likelihood (FEL) method detected a considerable proportion of negatively selected sites in all three genes (Table 1). The protein products of the three genes share a common topological structure, display considerable sequence identity, and perform the same molecular function, albeit in different cell types. To test whether structural/functional constraints represent major drivers of molecular evolution, we used FEL to calculate the normalized dN-dS value at each site and we correlated this parameter across corresponding sites (on the basis of the pairwise protein alignments). Although a significant correlation between dN-dS values was detected for G6PC and G6PC2 (Spearman’s rank correlation, p = 0.0062), as well as for G6PC and G6PC3 (Spearman’s rank correlation, p = 0.0025), the correlation coefficients were small (ρ = 0.15 and 0.16, respectively). No significant correlation was detected for the G6PC2-G6PC3 pair (Spearman’s rank correlation, p = 0.123, ρ = 0.08). \n\nA common expectation is that mutations at highly constrained codons are more likely to disrupt protein structure/function and, therefore, to cause disease. To date, 57 independent GSD1A missense mutations involving 47 unique codons have been reported. We observed that codons that carry at least one missense mutation are significantly more likely to show statistical evidence of negative selection (FEL p value < 0.1) than codons where no mutation has been described (Fisher’s Exact Test, two tailed, p = 0.044, odds ratio = 2.19, 95% confidence intervals: 0.99–5.34). The same calculation was not performed for G6PC3 mutations, as too few of such mutations are actually known (number of mutated codons = 9, seven of which negatively selected).\n\nPositive selection at the mammalian G6PC2 gene\n\nPositive selection may act on specific sites in a protein that is otherwise selectively constrained; to test for evidence of positive selection in the three G6",

The total tree length for eutherian mammals sequences varied between 6.44 and 8.65 (Table 1); these values are within an optimal accuracy range for codeml sites models. codeml was applied to compare models of gene evolution that allow (NSsite model M8 and M2a, positive selection models) or disallow (NSsite models M1a, M8a and M7, null models) a class of codons to evolve with dN/dS > 1. As reported in Table 2, all null models were rejected in favor of the positive selection models for G6PC2; the same result was obtained using different codon frequency models (F3x4 and F61) (Table 2). Conversely, no evidence of positive selection was obtained for G6PC and G6PC3 (Additional file 1: Table S3). These results indicate that G6PC2 alone evolved adaptively in mammals. The Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis (from model M8) identified 5 codons showing strong evidence of positive selection (posterior probability > 0.95); most of these were also detected by FEL or REL (Table 2). With the exclusion of codon 137, selected sites were located in the C-terminal portion of the protein, often within highly constrained regions (Fig. 2a). Human coding polymorphisms that modulate glycemic traits are mainly located in this C-terminal highly constrained region (Fig. 2a); most of these variants affect codons that were targeted by negative selection during mammalian evolution (Fig. 2a).  \n\nEvolutionary analysis of G6Pase genes in humans and great apes\n\nWe next applied a population genetics-phylogenetics approach to study the evolution of G6Pase genes in the human, chimpanzee, and gorilla lineages. Specifically, we ran the gammaMap program that jointly uses intra-specific variation and inter-specific diversity to estimate the distribution of fitness effects (i.e. population-scaled selection coefficients, γ) along coding regions. gammaMap categorizes codons into 12 classes of γ, ranging from strongly beneficial (γ = 100) to inviable (γ = −500); a γ equal to 0 indicates neutrality. The overall distribution of selection coefficients indicated that G6PC evolved under strong purifying selection in all lineages (median γ < −10, Fig. 2b). This was also the case for G6PC2 in non-human primates (median γ = −100), whereas the human gene showed weaker constraint (Fig. 2b). Finally, the distribution of fitness effects for G6PC3 was very different in distinct lineages. In fact, the codon distribution was almost homogeneous across the range of γ values in humans and chimpanzees, although the median remained below 0. In contrast, the gorilla lineage showed evidence of strong purifying selection (Fig. 2b). We thus assessed whether this pattern may derive from a relaxation of constraint in humans and chimpanzees. To test this possibility we applied the RELAX methodology to the G6PC3 primate phylogeny (Fig. 2c). Results were consistent with relaxed selection on the human/chimpanzee branches (p = 0.037, k = 0), but not on the gorilla lineage (p = 0.958, k = 1.05) (Fig. 2c). The same analysis for the human G6PC2 branch revealed no relaxation of selective pressure (p = 0.866, k = 1.21). gammaMap also identified two positively selected codons (cumulative probability > 0.80 of γ ≥ 1) for human G6PC2 (Fig. 2, Additional file 1: Table S4). One selected codon was also identified for human G6PC3 (site 243), whereas no positively selected sites were detected for G6PC in any lineage.\n\nEvolutionary analysis in human populations\n\nWe finally investigated whether positive selection acted on G6Pase genes during the recent evolutionary history of human populations. Using the 1000 Genomes Phase 1 data for Yoruba, European, and Chinese we calculated pairwise FST, an estimate of population genetic differentiation. We also performed the DIND (Derived Intra-allelic Nucleotide Diversity) and iHS (integrated haplotype score) tests for all SNPs mapping to these genes. Statistical significance (in terms of percentile rank) for the FST statistic and for the DIND test was obtained by deriving empirical distributions. For the iHS test, absolute values higher than 2 were considered as significant. No SNP in any G6Pase gene reached statistical significance (rank > 0.95) for both FST and for the DIND tests, and none had an |iHS| higher than 2. Overall, these results indicate that no variant/haplotype can be confidently called as positively selected. Likewise, nucleotide diversity (calculated as θW and π) for the entire gene regions was unexceptional if compared to those",

Likewise, nucleotide diversity (calculated as θW and π) for the entire gene regions was unexceptional if compared to those calculated for a reference set of 2000 genes. We conclude that G6Pase genes did not represent selection targets in recent human history.\n\nAssociation of G6PC2 variants with T2D\n\nSeveral genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a functional non-coding variant (rs560887) in G6PC2 that is associated with fasting glucose (FG) levels. More recently, multiple rare and common coding variants in this gene were shown to influence FG. As mentioned above, all these coding variants are located in the two terminal exons of G6PC2, where most sites that are positively selected in mammals also map (Fig. 2a). The best characterized variants (H177Y, Y207S, V219L, and R283X) exert an effect independent of each other and of the GWAS SNP, indicating that haplotype analysis rather than single variant association is better suited to assess the contribution of G6PC2 variants to metabolic traits. Despite their replicated effect on FG, the contribution of rare and common G6PC2 variants to T2D susceptibility has remained controversial. We thus investigated a possible role for G6PC2 variants in modulating the susceptibility to T2D in subjects from Saudi Arabia, a region with a high prevalence of metabolic disorders, including T2D. Specifically, we resequenced the two terminal exons of G6PC2 (Fig. 3) in 562 subjects from Saudi Arabia, 185 of whom suffering from T2D (Additional file 1: Table S5). To limit phenotype heterogeneity only non-obese individuals (BMI < 30) were included. The rs560887 GWAS variant was also genotyped. \n\nNo novel missense or nonsense variant was detected in either T2D subjects or healthy controls (HC) and the frequency of known rare missense and nonsense variants was not significantly different in T2D and HC (Additional file 1: Table S6). Two common missense variants were nevertheless detected in the last G6PC2 exon: rs492594 (V219L) and rs2232328 (S342C). The two variants display very limited linkage disequilibrium (LD) (Fig. 3). To address their contribution to T2D risk, logistic regression using age, sex, and BMI as covariates were used. After FDR correction for multiple tests, no association with T2D was observed (Table 3); conditioning on the GWAS variant, though, revealed a significant association for the two missense variants (Table 3). Haplotype analysis using the same covariates indicated above detected two haplotypes significantly associated with T2D (Table 4). Both the predisposing and the protective haplotype carry the glucose-raising allele at rs560887. The predisposing haplotype also includes the loss-of-function L219 allele (glucose-lowering) and the minor allele (C342) at rs2232328 (Table 4). These results should be regarded as preliminary due to the small sample size.  \n\nFinally, to assess the effect of rare and common G6PC2 variants on T2D risk, we applied a SNP-set based method, the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT). SKAT was run either by inclusion of all variants identified through re-sequencing (n = 13, Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Tables S6 and S7) or by limiting analysis to missense SNPs plus the GWAS variant (rs560887). No significant association was detected. However, as for single-variant associations, the power of SKAT is limited when small samples are analyzed.",

Further the pattern of dyslipidemia was studied which displayed that 47.9% combined type of dyslipidemia (low HDL-C and high TG, high LDL-C and high TG, low HDL-C and high LDL-C), 16.4% revealed mixed (high LDL-C, TG and low HDL-C) and 28.6% exposed single type (high LDL-C, high TG and low HDL-C) of dyslipidemia pattern. From the measurements it was noticed that LDL-C (74.20%) was the most deranged lipid type in the diabetic subject in the present study.\n\nApo-A1 was lower and ApoB100 levels were higher respectively in the diabetic group and illustrated a high statistical significance (p < 0.001) (Table 1). On comparing the apolipoprotein ratio (apoB100/apoA1), the diabetic group showed a higher value than non-diabetic group with high statistical significance.\n\nCorrelation between glycemic profile, lipid profile and apolipoproteins in T2DM\n\nThe glycemic profile showed positive correlation with lipid profile and apoliporotein status except for HOMA-B and apoA1 (Table 2).\n\nComparison of the lipid profile in diabetic individuals in different genotype models\n\nCC genotype was wild type homozygote genotype for rs174575 C > G, while GG was homozygous recessive variant. The allele and genotype frequencies have been described previously. Three models were included in this study—Additive model (CC vs CG vs GG); Dominant model (CC + CG vs GG); Recessive model (CC vs CG + GG) to compare the lipid profile and apolipoprotein levels status with the genotype.\n\nIn the additive model, TC, LDL-C and VLDL-C revealed statistically significant difference (Table 3). TC, LDL-C, TG and VLDL revealed statistically significant difference between the groups in the recessive model (Table 3). No statistically significant difference was observed in the dominant model (Table 3).\n\nGenotype association (rs174575 (FADS2)) with T2DM\n\nTo quantify the relationship between an exposure and a disease, association was measured as odds ratio. Logistic regression, univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify whether there is any associations between the SNP’s , triglycerides, insulin and risk of T2DM. A total of six predictive models for genotype (CG + GG) were studied to assess the association of genotype with T2DM. Three univariate model: Genotype (CG + GG) (model 1), TG (model 2), Insulin (model 3); two bivariate model: genotype and TG (model 4), genotype and insulin (model 5) and one multivariate model including genotype, TG and insulin (model 6) (Fig. 1).\n\nThe results of univariate analysis showed that rs174575 of the FADS 2 gene showed an odds risk (OR) of 3.149 (95% CI 1.579–6.282) (Model 1), TG showed an odds risk (OR) of 3.759 (95% CI 2.441–5.788) (Model 2) and insulin showed an odds risk (OR) of 1.32 (95% CI 1.32 (1.254–1.389) (Model 3). In the bivariate model rs174575 and TG showed an OR of 2.558 (95% CI 1.252–5.224); 1.317 (95% CI 1.251–1.386) and rs174575 and insulin showed an OR of 3.082 (95% CI 1.179–8.052); 1.317 (95% CI 1.251–1.386). In the multivariate model rs174575, TG and insulin showed an OR of 2.653 (95% CI 0.996–7.068); 2.66 (95% CI 1.543–4.585); 1.307 (95% CI1.242–1.376).Area under the curve (AUC) (X-axis in Fig. 1) depicts the accuracy of the measurement of a test i.e., an area of 0.9–1 represents a perfect test; an area of 0.5–0.7 is no better than chance. Therefore, model 1 (AUC = 0.55), model 2 (AUC = 0.685) and model 4 (AUC = 690) showed AUC ≤ 0.7 therefore the association may be by chance. However, model 3 (AUC = 0.925), model 5 (AUC = 0.925) and model 6 (AUC = 0.926) showed and AUC > 0.9 suggesting perfect association with T2DM risk (Fig. 1).",

Over a median follow-up time of 2.99 years (SD=2.02), 70 out of the 530 individuals developed MCR. The ages of the participants ranged from 61.90 to 94.70 years (mean 75.13±6.26 years), and 54.30% were women. The mean age of education was 17.55±2.63 years. Demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\n\n3.2 MCR\n\nThe 62 SNPs selected from 10 genes were found to be in accordance with Hardy- Weinberg expectation (p≥ 0.05). SNPs in the IL10 gene were associated with risk of developing incident MCR (Figure: 1). The most significant association was observed with rs3024498 in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) with ‘C’ allele associated with an increased risk of incident MCR (HR=1.926; 95%CI=1.315–2.822; p value=0.001, q-value=0.0305). The next significant association was found with ‘G’ allele of rs1800896 in the promoter region (HR = 1.667; 95%CI= 1.198–2.321; p value=0.002, q-value=0.0305). Other SNPs rs3024502, rs1800893 and rs3024492 which fall in the same Linkage disequilibrium (LD) block in the IL10 gene were found to be associated with incident MCR (Table: 2). Other SNPs in the CRP, IFNG, IL1A, IL1B, IL4, IL6, IL18, TNF and IL12A genes were not associated with incident MCR (Table: 2).\n\nUsing different genetic models, we tried to assess the effect of individual genotype, with associated risk allele in homozygous and as well as with heterozygous status, with incident MCR. Recessive model based analysis found homozygous GG genotype of rs1800896 (HR= 2.620; 95%CI= 1.560–4.401; p value=0.00027) and CC genotype of rs3024498 (HR= 4.447; 95%CI= 2.005–9.860; p value=0.00024) to be associated with incident MCR (Table: 3).\n\n3.3.

The MCR associated IL10 gene SNPs rs1800896 (HR= 1.047; 95%CI= 0.735–1.493; p value=0.798) and rs3024498 (HR=0.946; 95%CI= 0.577–1.550; p value=0.825) were not associated with incident MCI. Furthermore, we did not find an association of any our other selected variants in the neuroinflammatory pathways with incident MCI (Supplementary Table: 2). Of the 70 incident MCR cases in this study, only 15 (21%) met criteria for either incident or prevalent MCI at the same or earlier waves. The association of the IL10 polymorphisms rs1800896 (HR= 1.758; 95%CI= 1.208–2.560; p value=0.003) and rs3024498 (HR= 1.984; 95%CI= 1.305–3.017; p value=0.001) with incident MCR still remains significant even after removing these 15 MCI cases.\n\nThe association of IL10 SNPs, rs1800896 (HR = 1.673; 95%CI= 1.200–2.331; p value=0.002) and rs3024498 (HR =1.896; 95%CI= 1.290–2.786; p value=0.001) with incident MCR in the full model was significant even when adjusted for OPUS/OPEL status to account for the LonGenity study design. Inflammation plays an important role in many complex disorders including arthritis. Even after adjusting the present model with global health score, rs1800896 (HR=1.752; 95%CI=1.247–2.461; p value=0.001) and rs3024498 (HR=2.019; 95%CI=1.369–2.975; p value=0.0004) remained associated with incident MCR.\n\nOver the study follow-up there were 79 incident cases of slow gait and 86 incident cases of cognitive complaints. A significant association was observed between the two IL-10 SNPs that were significant in the primary analysis with incident slow gait; rs1800896 (HR = 1.754; 95%CI= 1.283–2.398; p value=0.0004) and rs3024498 (HR =1.758; 95%CI= 1.207–2.559; p value=0.003).

Linkage disequilibrium plot of IL10 gene in our cohort showed presence of associated SNPs in a single LD block (Figure: 2). Haplotype analysis to investigate the combined effect of IL10 SNPs found significant association (p-value =0.006) with haplotype involving risk alleles (TCATGGT) at seven loci combination (20% vs. 13.6%) (Supplementary Table: 1). Further, considering that these SNPs were located in the transcription regulatory regions, we used an in silco approach to determine whether they were local expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). From the eQTL data available from 338 whole blood samples in GTEx, we determined rs3024498 (p-value= 0.0000018) and rs3024492 (p-value= 0.0000032) to be significant eQTL for IL10 gene. SNP in the 3’ UTR, rs3024498 ‘C’ allele correlates with increased expression of IL10 gene in whole blood (Figure: 3). In silico functional analysis using Regulome DB provided a score of 4, indicating its location in DNase hypersensitive site (DHS) and role in transcriptional factor (TF) binding. However, using FuncPred, we couldn’t find differential binding of miRNA for rs3024498, though it was predicted site for hsa-miR-496. Using BRAINEAC database we observed expressional difference of IL10 gene across different brain regions but we couldn’t verify the effect of the associated SNPs (Supplementary Figure: 1). Earlier expressional studies showed association with the promoter polymorphism rs1800896 with the ‘G’ allele being associated with increased expression of IL10, but data for this SNP were not found in eQTL and other in-silico approaches. In summary, we found significant association of MCR occurrence with SNPs in regulatory regions of IL10 gene involved in regulation of expression, namely rs1800896 in the promoter region and rs3024498 in the 3’UTR.",

    "content": "Diagnosis of NAFLD\n\nDiagnosis of suspected NAFLD involves establishing that the patient satisfies the diagnostic criteria for NAFLD and excluding the presence of other coexisting liver diseases. Diagnosis of NAFLD requires demonstration of hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology and exclusion of significant alcohol use or other secondary causes of steatosis. In addition to alcohol consumption, secondary causes of hepatic steatosis include medications, chronic hepatitis C infection, parenteral nutrition, and Wilson's disease (Table 1).\n\nLiver biochemistries and other laboratory testing\n\nIn patients with suspected NAFLD, initial laboratory evaluation typically involves obtaining liver biochemistries and exclusion of chronic viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, and autoimmune hepatitis via appropriate diagnostic tests.\n\nIn patients with NAFLD, serum aminotransferases can be normal or mildly elevated. Serum aminotransferases generally wax and wane and they rarely exceed 200 U/L. Typically, ALT exceeds AST although the serum AST frequently exceeds ALT when there is advanced fibrosis. Alkaline phosphatase can also be elevated as well, and patients can have only an isolated elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase with normal aminotransferase levels. NAFLD is the most common cause of incidentally found abnormal liver biochemistries in the primary care setting. The sensitivity of abnormal aminotransferases in detecting NAFLD is poor since 55% to 79% of individuals with NAFLD may have normal transaminase levels. In patients with NAFLD, neither the degree of elevation nor the pattern of abnormal liver biochemistries are reliable in determining that the disease activity and risk of disease progression. In addition, changes of aminotransferase levels do not parallel changes in fibrosis stage preventing them from being a reliable surrogate for fibrosis progression.\n\nMildly elevated serum ferritin is common in patients with NAFLD though it is typically not associated with increased hepatic iron stores. However, elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in patients with suspected NAFLD should prompt genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis. A liver biopsy should be considered in a patient with suspected NAFLD who is homozygous or compound heterozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene to assess hepatic iron concentration and to evaluate for significant liver injury and fibrosis.\n\nMild elevations of autoantibodies are relatively common in patients with NAFLD. A similar phenomenon has been observed in liver disorders such as viral hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury and is generally considered as an epiphenomenon. A recent study from the NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN), found that positive serum autoantibodies, defined as antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer ≥1:160 or antismooth muscle antibody (ASMA) ≥1:40, were present in 21% of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and they were not associated with more advanced histologic features. However, if there are additional features suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis, such as markedly elevated aminotransferase, high γ-globulin, or high serum immunoglobulin G, then a liver biopsy may be considered necessary to firmly establish the diagnosis.\n\nSeveral models have been developed that combine laboratory testing, demographic variables, and clinical data to predict NASH with advanced fibrosis, but their detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this review article. The NAFLD fibrosis score (http://nafldscore.com/) is a promising bedside tool for identifying NAFLD patients who are at high risk for advanced fibrosis, and it employs six easily available variables (age, hyperglycemia, body mass index, platelet count, albumin, and AST/ALT ratio). In a recent meta-analysis of 13 published studies, the NAFLD fibrosis score had a pooled area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.85 for predicting advanced fibrosis (stage 3 or 4). The NAFLD fibrosis score less than 1.455 had 90% sensitivity and 60% specificity to exclude advanced fibrosis, while a score greater than 0.676 had 67% sensitivity and 97% specificity to identify the presence of advanced fibrosis. Enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) panel employs automated immunoassay of three serum markers of matrix constituents and mediators of matrix remodeling (hyaluronic acid, amino-terminal propeptide of type III collagen, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1). The ELF panel has an AUROC of 0.90 for detection of advanced fibrosis with a threshold of 0.3576 associated with a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value of 71%, and a negative predictive value of 94%.\n\nStudies suggest that hepatocyte apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hepatocyte apoptosis results in caspase 3 generated cleavage fragment of cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) being released. The serum CK-18 fragments can be measured by ELISA, and they significantly increased in patients with NASH compared with simple steatosis and normal controls. The circulating levels of CK-18 fragments have been shown to reflect disease activity, and change in their level may correlate with the change in NAFLD activity score. In a recent meta-analysis, the pooled AUROC of serum CK-18 for detection of NASH was 0.82 with a sensitivity and specificity of 78% and 87%, respectively.\n\nImaging\n\nA number of imaging modalities have been employed in the diagnosis of NAFLD. Although several different imaging techniques are valuable in demonstrating steatosis, the ability of current imaging technologies to evaluate fibrosis and especially inflammatory activity is limited.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound is a relatively inexpensive, noninvasive diagnostic test to demonstrate steatosis with excellent sensitivity",

Although several different imaging techniques are valuable in demonstrating steatosis, the ability of current imaging technologies to evaluate fibrosis and especially inflammatory activity is limited.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound is a relatively inexpensive, noninvasive diagnostic test to demonstrate steatosis with excellent sensitivity in individuals with moderate to severe hepatic steatosis. Steatosis is visualized as increased echogenicity with bright liver echo pattern on ultrasound B-mode examination and increased attenuation. In a study of ultrasound paired with liver biopsy the reported sensitivity ultrasound for the detection steatosis of 64% to 91%, and a specificity of 93% to 97%. Morbid obesity was associated with a lower sensitivity, and higher degrees of steatosis with a greater sensitivity.\n\nNoncontrast abdominal CT is also useful in demonstrating hepatic steatosis. When contrast enhanced CT is performed, the portal phase images should be employed for the determination of steatosis though contrast may result in decreased sensitivity and specificity compared with noncontrast scans. On a CT scan, hepatic steatosis is visualized as decreased attenuation of the liver, resulting in the liver appearing darker than the spleen and is associated with decreased liver attenuation index, which is the difference between the mean hepatic and splenic attenuation in Hounsfield units. The sensitivity of a CT scan for detecting steatosis greater than 30% was as high as 82% in a study involving potential living liver donors.\n\nAbdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive technique for demonstrating steatosis. T1-weighted gradient-echo magnetic resonance images are acquired with an echo time such that water and lipid spins are in phase or opposed phase allowing lipid quantitation by relative loss of signal intensity on opposed-phase images compared with that on in-phase images. In a study of potential living donors MRI demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100%, and 92.3%, and 93%, respectively, for detection of steatosis in patients with greater than 20% steatosis by liver biopsy. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been employed to quantitate hepatic steatosis by measuring hepatic triglyceride content although its use remains primarily investigational.\n\nHeterogeneity of hepatic steatosis including focal sparing is a relatively common finding with each of the imaging modalities. The most common locations are the gallbladder fossa, and the areas adjacent to the porta hepatis and falciform ligament. Conversely, focal fatty infiltration can also be observed where steatosis is increased in only one region of the liver.\n\nTransient elastography is an ultrasound-based noninvasive method of assessing of fibrosis through measurement of liver stiffness. Although insensitive for detection of early fibrosis, transient elastography can be useful in screening for advanced fibrosis in many patients. In a study involving patients with NAFLD, transient elastography demonstrated a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 75% for detecting stage 3 or higher fibrosis with positive and negative predictive values of 52% and 97%, respectively. Unfortunately, body habitus can limit the application of this study since there is an increased failure rate in obtaining a successful transient elastography measurement with increasing degree of obesity. Also, transient elastography is not currently commercially available in the United States. Magnetic resonance elastography is a promising technique that measures liver stiffness over a larger region of the liver than transient elastography; this research tool is currently available at a limited number of centers.\n\nLiver biopsy\n\nLiver biopsy remains the gold standard for characterizing the histology of NAFLD. It can play an important role in the diagnosis of NAFLD, but it is expensive and carries risk of morbidity and very rarely mortality. Histological examination of liver tissue allows for exclusion of competing etiologies as well as for the assessment of coexisting liver diseases. Currently, liver biopsy is the only tool available for assessing the degree of inflammation and cell injury and to stage for the degree of fibrosis. It is invaluable to differentiate simple steatosis from NASH.\n\nMacrovesicular steatosis is a predominant feature of NAFLD, and the presence of steatosis in greater than 5% of hepatocytes is generally accepted as fatty liver (Fig. 1A). In addition to steatosis, common histologic findings in NASH include hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation that is either mixed type or neutrophil predominant, and varying degrees of fibrosis (Figs. 1B and C). There are no histologic features that reliably differentiate NASH for alcoholic hepatitis, and the term NASH was originally employed in a report from the Mayo Clinic regarding 20 patients with a liver disease that histologically mimicked alcoholic hepatitis in patients without significant alcohol intake. A histopathological classification system for NASH was originally developed by Brunt et al., with histologic features distinctive to NASH employed in determining the necroinflammatory activity (grade) and architectural alterations (stage). The NAFLD activity score (NAS), an unweighted sum of steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning scores, was developed by the NASH CRN as a tool to quantify changes in liver histology in NAFLD therapeutic trials. There is not a threshold value of NAS that reliably identifies the presence of NASH.\n\nThere can be significant sampling error due to the small portion of the liver sampled by a biopsy and the inhomogeneous distribution of the histologic lesions of NASH. This sample variability is moderate for hepatocyte ballooning and perisinusoidal fibrosis and is somewhat higher for lobular inflammation.\n\nPathogenesis of NAFLD\n\nSeveral pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the basis for fat accumulation, liver injury, and fibrosis in NAFLD, but",

This sample variability is moderate for hepatocyte ballooning and perisinusoidal fibrosis and is somewhat higher for lobular inflammation.\n\nPathogenesis of NAFLD\n\nSeveral pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the basis for fat accumulation, liver injury, and fibrosis in NAFLD, but their detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this review article. Interested readers are alerted to several recent comprehensive reviews on this subject. Despite considerable research in this area, the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains incompletely understood. It has been very challenging to differentiate causative factors from associated phenomena and downstream effects. Although there is an increased understanding of the pathogenesis of hepatic fat accumulation, there are critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of mediators and mechanisms of hepatocyte injury, mediators of stellate cell activation, and fibrosis. It remains a puzzle why some individuals with NAFLD have advanced histological features and develop cirrhosis whereas others with comparable risk factor profile have simple steatosis with minimal or no disease progression. A genetic basis for inter-individual phenotypic variability is strongly suspected, but genetic studies are very limited in individuals with histologically characterized NASH.\n\nInsulin resistance is nearly universal in NAFLD and it is believed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. In adipocytes, insulin resistance results in increased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase, which results in lipolysis of triglycerides and release of free fatty acids into circulation. Fatty acids taken up by hepatocytes from circulation and produced by de novo lipogenesis undergo esterification resulting in hepatocytes steatosis. Initially it was proposed that NASH resulted from a “two-hit” mechanism with hepatocyte steatosis being the initial metabolic insult that then allows a second injury leading to NASH. However, subsequent research has cast significant doubt on this paradigm, and it is now widely believed that free fatty acids and their metabolic products (e.g., diacylglycerol) and sequelae (e.g., free radicals) are the likely mediators of hepatocyte injury.\n\nAt a cellular level, several different mechanisms have been proposed for causing hepatocyte injury, including apoptosis, perturbations in autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, alterations in natural killer T cell and Kupffer cell function, and an increase in inflammatory cytokines. Apoptosis appears to play an important role in hepatocyte death in NAFLD, and free fatty acids could be the primary mediators of hepatocyte apoptosis (lipoapoptosis). In addition, phagocytosis of hepatocyte apoptotic bodies by stellate cells leads to their activation and likely plays an important role in fibrosis.",

FKBP5 mRNA levels were significantly higher in schizophrenia cases than controls (61.5%, ANCOVA F(1, 33) = 8.93, p = 0.005; Figure 2A). The FKBP5 mRNA expression values of 10 (out of 20) schizophrenia cases were higher than the highest control FKBP5 expression value. These findings were not driven by effects of suicide in the schizophrenia group, because although FKBP5 mRNA levels varied significantly according to suicide status (ANCOVA F(2, 32) = 6.39, p < 0.005), FKBP5 expression levels within the schizophrenia (non-suicide) group were higher than controls (83% increase), whereas levels in the schizophrenia (suicide) group were not different to controls (3% decrease). Levels of PTGES3 mRNA were significantly higher in schizophrenia cases relative to controls (22.4%, ANCOVA F(1, 33) = 7.27, p = 0.01; Figure 2B). There were no significant differences between schizophrenia cases and controls in the mRNA expression of BAG1 (ANCOVA F(1, 33) = 0.35, p = 0.56) or FKBP4 (ANCOVA F(1, 33) = 1.00, p = 0.33; Figure 2C and 2D). The achieved power of ANCOVA analyses ranged from 0.52 to 0.87, and are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Significant correlations of co-factor mRNAs with other clinical/demographic variables in the TRC cohort are described in Supplementary Results and Supplementary Table S1.\n\nThe number of normalized RNA-Seq reads mapping to specific FKBP5 exons in schizophrenia cases and controls were compared (Supplementary Results and Supplementary Table S2). Three FKBP5 exons which are common to FKBP5 mRNA transcripts 1–3, and one exon unique to transcript variant 4, had significantly more mapped reads in schizophrenia cases than controls (all 1.4 to 1.9-fold increases, 0.005 < p < 0.05).\n\nThese results were replicated by qPCR in the Stanley Array cohort (for cohort details see Table 2). FKBP5 mRNA levels (total expression of FKBP5 transcript variants 1–4) differed significantly according to diagnosis (ANCOVA F(2, 87) = 6.00, p < 0.005), with a 68.0% increase in schizophrenia cases relative to controls (p < 0.001; Figure 2E). As in the TRC cohort, FKBP5 mRNA levels varied significantly according to suicide status (ANCOVA F(4, 85) = 3.67, p < 0.01), with substantially higher FKBP5 expression levels within the schizophrenia (non-suicide) group than controls (87% increase), and marginally higher levels in the schizophrenia (suicide) group than controls (5% increase). Increased FKBP5 mRNA expression was also seen in bipolar disorder cases relative to controls (47.5%, p < 0.05; Figure 2E). No effects of suicide were seen in the bipolar disorder group. The FKBP5 mRNA expression values of 10 (out of 32) schizophrenia cases, and 6 (out of 29) bipolar disorder cases, were higher than the highest control FKBP5 expression value. PTGES3 mRNA expression was also 35.8% greater in schizophrenia cases than controls (Figure 2F). When testing whether findings from the TRC cohort were replicated, this increase was significant (one-tailed t-test, p < 0.01), although the overall effect of diagnosis on PTGES3 expression did not reach significance (ANCOVA F(2, 88) = 2.70, p = 0.07). Unlike in the TRC cohort, BAG1 mRNA levels differed significantly between diagnostic groups (ANCOVA F(2, 91) = 5.02, p < 0.01), with a 12.1% decrease in schizophrenia cases relative to controls (p < 0.05), and a 14.9% decrease in bipolar disorder cases relative to controls (p < 0.005; Figure 2G). There were no significant diagnostic differences in mRNA expression of FKBP4 (ANCOVA F(2, 91) = 2.11, p = 0.13; Figure 2H).

Expression of total GR, GR-1B, GR-1C and GR-1H mRNA transcripts was previously quantified in the same cohort using the same qPCR methods. The HSP chaperones and PTGES3 were significantly positively correlated with each other (all 0.29 < r < 0.77, p < 0.01), as were co-factors BAG1 and FKBP4 (r = 0.45, p < 5x10−6). GR-1B mRNA was negatively correlated with FKBP5, PTGES3 and all HSPs (all −0.19 < r < −0.53, 1x10−6 < p < 0.08) and positively correlated with FKBP4 and BAG1 (all 0.23 < r < 0.33, p < 0.05).

There was no significant effect of diagnosis on FKBP51 protein abundance (ANCOVA F(2, 95) = 0.96, p = 0.39; Figure 5B).\n\nEffects of FKBP5 genotype on FKBP5 mRNA and FKBP51 protein expression in the DLPFC\n\nIndividuals in the Stanley Array cohort were genotyped at 8 SNPs within the FKBP5 gene (Figure 5C). A significant main effect of genotype on FKBP5 mRNA levels was observed for rs4713916 (ANOVA F(2, 76) = 3.49, p < 0.05) within combined control, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia samples. FKBP5 mRNA expression was 27.5% lower in TT homozygotes (n = 9) than TC heterozygotes (n = 32, p < 0.05). There were no other significant main effects of genotyped SNPs on FKBP5 gene expression (all F < 2.23, p > 0.11), nor were there significant genotype x diagnosis interactions.

We detected 7 deletions and 35 gains (100.1–3,590kb in length), with 5 samples harboring more than one rearrangement (Table 1). MLPA was used for validation (42/42) and determination of the inheritance pattern (41/42): all tested rearrangements were inherited except for the larger deletion. We also detected and validated 2 additional CNVs on the X-chromosome for a total of 44 CNVs.\n\nClinical data about the parental phenotype was available in all but two families with CNVs. The progenitor harboring the CNV was obese (defined as BMI >30) in 21 cases (53.8%), was overweight (BMI 25–30) in 7 cases (17.9%) and had a BMI in the normal range in 11 cases (28.2%). More than half of the rare CNVs (25 of 44), 21 gains and 4 deletions, were not found in any of the 9,820 adult population controls.\n\nIn order to analyze the global burden of rare CNVs in EOO, we compared the amount, type and length of autosomal CNVs in patients (157) with respect to 500 Spanish population controls (Table 2). Rare CNVs were found in 15.8% of controls with respect to the 22.9% frequency found in patients (p = 0.053). Rare CNVs were predominantly gains in both cohorts (83.3% in EOO patients and 77.6% in controls). When the frequency of deletions and gains was analyzed separately, no differences were observed in deletion-type CNVs (3.8% in controls and 4.5% in patients), while a statistically significant difference in the frequency of gains was detected (p = 0.0358). Thus, there is a higher burden of CNVs in EOO patients due to rare gain-type CNVs.\n\nIf we consider specific CNVs as those not described in the initial 9,820 subjects used to establish the frequency of each alteration in the population, 8.2% control individuals carried a CNV fulfilling this criteria while the frequency was 14.0% in EOO patients, with this difference being statistically significant (p = 0.0422).\n\nRegarding the co-occurrence of more than one CNV in the same subject, two or three hits were present in 3.2% patients and 1% controls. This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.0644) likely due to the small sample size. The inheritance pattern of these alterations was established in patients; in two cases each alteration was inherited from a different parent and in the remaining three both rearrangements were inherited from the same progenitor. Case Ob_15 presented a third de novo event additionally to the two rearrangements inherited from her obese mother.\n\nPotentially pathogenic CNVs\n\nCNVs were considered to have a higher probability to be pathogenic when they were exclusive of the EOO population, co-segregated with the phenotype in the family, disrupted known genes for the disorder and/or were found in more than one case.\n\nNine duplications and two deletions were absent in 9,820 population controls and co-segregated with the phenotype in the family (Table 1). One of them was a 137kb gain in 7p15.3 containing a single coding gene, NPY (MIM 162640), identified in a male case (Ob_12) presenting with EOO and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Fig 2A). The CNV was inherited from the also obese mother (Fig 2B). Additional cases of severe EOO and ADHD were identified in the maternal branch of this family by report (Fig 2C), but unfortunately no additional samples or clinical data could be obtained.\n\nSome CNVs overlapped with previously described microdeletion/microduplication syndromes (Table 1). Rearrangements partially overlapping with the critical region of the 22q11.2 distal deletion syndrome were identified in two patients. Ob_35 carried a 676kb deletion encompassing several genes including RSPH14 (MIM 605663) and GNAZ (MIM 139160), while a more proximal deletion including TOP3B (MIM 603582) was detected in Ob_34. A gain of 348kb at 1q21.1 overlapping with the region of Thrombocytopenia-Absent Radius syndrome (MIM 274000) was detected in case Ob_39; as its frequency in controls was 1/1,720 it was not included in the subset of selected CNVs.\n\nTwo CNVs fulfilling the established criteria were identified in more than one patient (Table 1). A gain of 139kb in 9q34.3 only including C9orf62 was found in three cases (Ob_1, Ob_2, Ob_3). However, the parents also carrying the CNV had either overweight or normal weight. Another gain of 106kb in 7p22.1 encompassing RNF216 (MIM 609948) and ZNF815P was identified in two cases (Ob_4, Ob_5), inherited from obese parents. We then completed the analysis of the CN",

We then completed the analysis of the CNVs identified in the entire sample of obese individuals (n = 480) and the Spanish adult non-obese controls (n = 480) by MLPA. All rare CNVs were patient-specific except for a second patient with a deletion at 11p15.4. None of the rare CNVs were identified among controls except for the 106kb gain at 7p22.1 that was found in 5 controls. The re-analysis of SNP array data unraveled the complexity of mapping this region due to small segmental duplications and was used to determine the real frequency of the rearrangement, which was above the established threshold of the study (1/2,000).\n\nAssociation study with common CNVs\n\nWe also explored more common CNVs already described in association with obesity. The gain in 10q26.3 including CYP2E1 was more common in patients than in controls (6.4% vs 3.6%) as previously described, but did not reach significance (OR: 2.01, CI95% 0.93–4.36, p-value = 0.075). The frequency of the homozygous deletion encompassing olfactory receptors in 11q11 was 5.1% in cases, which was slightly lower than the frequency in the control cohort (6.7%). Therefore, our data did not replicate the previous findings that indicate a preferable transmission of the 11q11 deletion to obese children. In addition, in this study we did not detect alterations in the 16p11.2 region, including or next to the SH2B1 (MIM 608937) gene.\n\nIdentification of RSVs in novel genes by targeted capture sequencing of pooled DNA\n\nAll genes included and/or disrupted by CNVs found in more than one patient and/or co-segregating in a familial case were selected for sequence analysis (n = 14): SCFD2, NPY, ISM1 (MIM 615793), TASP1 (MIM 608270), GRM7, LOC401164, TRIML1, SLCO4C1, SLCO6A1, C11orf40, TRIM68 (MIM 613184), GRIK1, TOP3B and GRPR. In order to sequence the total number of patients (480) and controls (480) in a cost-efficient manner, pools of 20 DNA samples were sequenced with each DNA sample located in two pools.\n\nWe first validated the suitability and specificity of the pipeline to detect real variants among the pools. RSVs were considered when they had a frequency below 1/1.000 in the public database of the Exome Sequencing Consortium (ExAC) representing more than 60,000 exomes. We selected 23 alterations predicted to be in a single sample and reanalyzed the same sample by Sanger sequencing. All 23 RSVs were validated in the specific samples.\n\nWe then compared the total burden of RSVs per gene between patients and controls. Significant differences were identified in a few loci, namely NPY, GRIK1 (MIM 138245) and GRPR (MIM 305670) (Table 3). A single missense RSV in NPY (p.V86D) was identified in patient Ob_158, while no RSVs of this gene were found in controls. Although the residue is not evolutionarily conserved and is located outside the main functional domain, the change is likely to affect the shape and the affinity of the NPY protein and has not been described in ExAC. The study of parental samples revealed that the RSV was inherited from the obese father (BMI 34.3 kg/m2). The low frequency of missense variants in this gene in the ExAC database (only 27 among 118.884 alleles) further reinforces its functional relevance.\n\nA nonsense mutation (p.R897X) was identified in GRIK1, encoding the ionotropic glutamate receptor 1, in patient Ob_163. This nonsense variant has a frequency below 1/15000 alleles and, generally, nonsense and frameshift variants at the GRIK1 gene are rare, representing less than 1/3000 alleles in the ExAC database. Additional missense mutations were identified in both glutamate receptors (GRIK1 and GRM7 (MIM 604101)), but with no significant differences between cases and controls.\n\nFour different missense mutations were detected in GRPR in five patients with obesity, while no mutations in this gene were found in controls (5/662 alleles vs 0/726 alleles; p = 0.0245). One of the mutations has never been found in ExAC, while the remaining three had frequencies <1/1000 alleles and all are predicted to result in significant functional consequences.\n\nFinally, a RSV in SLCO4C1 (MIM 609013) was identified in a patient harboring a deletion encompassing the same gene previously identified by CMA. The RSV (p.I233L) has not been described previously and affects a highly conserved amino acid (phylo P = 0.975). The frequency of the deletion in the control cohort is 0/9,820. Parental studies confirmed that each progenitor had transmitted one of the alterations; the deletion was inherited from the obese father and",

Parental studies confirmed that each progenitor had transmitted one of the alterations; the deletion was inherited from the obese father and the RSV from the non-obese mother. These findings are compatible with a recessive pattern of inheritance or a two-hit mechanism, with a major contribution of the CNV (inherited from an obese progenitor) and an additional and milder effect of the RSVs (inherited from a non-obese progenitor).\n\nCo-expression enrichment analyses\n\nWe focused our subsequent analysis on four novel candidate genes considering our CNVs and RSVs findings: GRIK1, GRM7, GRPR and SLCO4C1. To explore their possible role in obesity, we looked for co-expressions with a stringent list of 15 genes previously related with obesity. We selected a total 10 genes with described highly penetrant mutations in severely obese patients, all of them coding for proteins of the leptin-melanocortin pathway: LEP, LEPR, MC4R, POMC (MIM 176830), PCSK1 (MIM 162150), MC3R (MIM 155540), BDNF (MIM 113505), NTRK2 (MIM600456), PPARG (MIM 601487) and SIM1(MIM 603128). We also included 5 additional genes with a relevant intermediary role in the same pathway: ADRB3 (MIM 109691), PCSK2 (MIM 162151), NPY, NPY1R (MIM 162641), AGRP (MIM 602311) (Fig 3A).\n\nA total of 10 shared co-expressed partners were identified in the analysis between our 4 novel strongest candidate genes (GRIK1, GRM7, GRPR and SLCO4C1) and the set of 15 obesity-related genes described in the literature. The maximum number of shared co-expressed partners between our 4 genes and 500 genes sets randomly selected was 7, being the empirical p-value of this difference 0.002 (Fig 3B and 3C).",

Results\n\nIn total, 927 subjects were screened for participation in the study, 325 of them were excluded due to eligibility, and 602 of them met inclusion criteria and were allocated to patients with PMO (355 women) and control (247 women) groups, followed by clinical examinations and genetic testing.\n\n3.1. Study Subjects Charactetistic\n\nThe clinical characteristics of the analyzed cohort are summarized in Table 1. The mean age of all individuals was 62.4 years, the mean weight, height, and BMI were 72.4 kg, 159.8 cm, and 28.4 kg/m2, respectively. All participants were ethnic Belarusians.\n\nCases and controls did not differ in age, age at menopause, and height (Mann‒Whitney U-test did not reveal difference, p > 0.1). A strong difference between groups was revealed for weight, BMI, lumbar spine, and femoral neck BMD, T-, and Z-scores. The weight and BMI variables were considered potential confounding factors and were adjusted in analysis of association between groups. In the study cohort, 49 patients with PMO had a fracture history (at least one) compared to seven individuals from the control group. The baseline serum 25(OH)D level ranged from 7.4 to 70 ng/mL, and the mean level in all individuals was 25.5 ng/mL. There was a statistically significant difference between analyzed groups in the plasma 25(OH)D level.\n\n3.2. The Relationship between VDR Gene Variants and PMO Risk\n\nAll subjects were genotyped in the study; the genotype frequencies distribution is presented in Table 2. The five most common polymorphic loci of the VDR gene were selected from key publications and studied as candidate markers of PMO. These SNVs with previously established involvement in vitamin D and bone tissue metabolisms were included to the study to validate their effect by analysis of combinations of genetic variants on independent cohorts.\n\nThe minor allele frequencies of all analyzed SNVs were not significantly different from those taken from GnomAD data for Europeans. By the analysis, the genotyping data were found to be in correspondence to the expected Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium at the 5% level in the control group (p > 0.1). In case group, the deviation from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was revealed only for the rs7975232 variant (p = 0.02), which was possibly due to the very low frequency of the T/T homozygous genotype.\n\nThe analysis of genotype frequencies of VDR gene variants, presented in Table 2, showed significant differences in their distribution between both groups. The most frequent homozygous genotype was taken for reference. Comparing the genotype frequencies between PMO and CON groups, statistically significant differences after FDR correction for multiple testing were found for rs7975232, rs1544410, and rs731236 variants of the VDR gene. The PMO group individuals were more likely to carry the rs7975232 A/A genotype (30.4%) compared to the CON group (20.6%, OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.2‒3.1, p FDR = 0.0175). The rs1544410 T/T genotype was significantly over-represented in PMO patients (27.9%) compared to control group (17.0%, OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.5‒3.8, p FDR = 0.0028). For the bearers of the rs731236 G/G homozygous genotype, the risk of osteoporosis was increased (OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.6‒4.1, p FDR = 0.0015). An increased risk of PMO was also revealed for the bearers of the heterozygous genotype A/G, OR = 1.6 (95% CI 1.1‒2.3).\n\nTo reduce the potential impact of confounding factors, the association analysis was further adjusted for BMI. When adjusted, the associated gene variants remained significant; additionally, a statistically significant association was revealed for the rs1544410 heterozygous C/T genotype (Table 2).\n\nThere was no association with osteoporosis risk found for rs2228570 and rs11568820 variants. Since the rs11568820 T-allele frequency was very low, we used a dominant model of inheritance and merged C/T+T/T genotypes. Despite the absence of significant association after the Yates correction, it can be noted that the frequency of the rs11568820 T/T-genotype is significantly higher in the CON group (4.0%) compared to PMO patients (0.9%).\n\nNext, we analyzed the pairwise linkage disequilibrium between VDR gene variants. An LD plot was constructed using combined genotype data from both groups of individuals (Figure 1).\n\nPerformed LD analysis identified one haplotype block, which was composed of VDR rs7975232, rs1544410, and rs731236 variants. The measure of linkage strength D’ between rs7975232 and rs1544410 was 91, p < 0.0001. The positive coefficient of correlation r2 suggests that major alleles of rs7975232, rs1544410, and rs731236 variants are likely to be inherited together, as well as minor alleles. The rs2228570 and rs11568820 variants do not exhibit significant LD, the D’ coefficient ranged for them from 2 to 6; therefore, they were removed from further analysis.\n\nBased on LD data, in further analysis, we combined three VDR gene variants from the same block and performed the",

Haplotypes were constructed from all possible allelic combinations and compared between the PMO and control (CON) groups (Table 3).\n\nThe haplotype analysis revealed five combinations (C-C-A, A-T-G, A-T-A, C-C-G, and A-C-A) of the possible eight with a frequency greater than 3%. These five haplotypes jointly presented in 96.5% of study subjects. Statistically significant differences between analyzed groups were revealed in the global distribution of allelic combinations (global p = 0.00023), suggesting an association of analyzed haplotypes with the risk of PMO. A statistically significant difference was revealed in the distribution of the most frequent C-C-A and A-T-G haplotypes between the PMO and CON groups even after FDR correction for multiple testing. The C-C-A haplotype, constructed from three wild-type alleles, was the most frequent (total frequency 43.4%). This haplotype frequency was significantly higher among controls (49.6%) than among cases (38.6%, p FDR = 0.001). The negative haplotype score value of −3.53 suggests that this combination is associated with a decreased risk of PMO. The total frequency of the A-T-G haplotype was 39.4%; it was significantly under-represented in the CON group (31.7%) compared to the PMO group (44.9%, p FDR = 0.00005), suggesting that this allelic combination might confer a greater susceptibility to PMO (the highest haplotype score of 4.41 points). In comparison with the most frequent reference (wild-type) haplotype C-C-A, for the bearers of the A-T-G haplotype, the risk of PMO was significantly higher (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.4‒2.3, p = 0.0001). No significant association was found for other constructed haplotypes.\n\n3.3. The Relationship between VDR Gene Variants and Lumbar Spine BMD Level\n\nThe association analysis between VDR gene single variants and haplotypes and LS BMD level was performed using linear regression on the combined cohort of study subjects (Figure 2).\n\nThe analysis revealed four VDR gene variants associated with L1-L4 BMD level. The observed difference in BMD level for rs7975232, rs1544410, and rs731236 minor homozygous genotypes compared to reference genotypes was almost the same (β = −0.13 g/cm2, p FDR = 0.0003; β = −0.15 g/cm2, p FDR = 0.0005, and β = −0.13 g/cm2, p FDR = 0.00025, respectively). Such a similar effect may be explained by the previously observed high LD between rs7975232, rs1544410, and rs731236. Interestingly, for all these variants, there was a gene/dose response revealed: the highest level of BMD was found for the bearers of major homozygous genotype, the intermediate level was found in heterozygotes, and the lowest level was found in minor homozygotes (Figure 2A–C). Quantitative analysis of the rs11568820 variant revealed a more significant association with LS BMD level (Figure 2E). The substitution of G to A was associated with much higher LS BMD values (β = 0.22, 95% CI 0.07‒0.38, p FDR = 0.027), suggesting that the rs11568820 A-allele has a protective effect. No significant association for rs2228570 was found with LS BMD (Figure 2D). As there was a strong positive LD between rs7975232, rs1544410, and rs731236 variants, we performed an analysis of association of their haplotypes with LS BMD level (Figure 2F). The bearers of the A-T-G haplotype showed a higher decrease in LS BMD compared to reference C-C-A (β = −0.09, 95% CI −0.13…−0.06, p FDR = 0.0001). No significant association with BMD was found for other haplotypes.\n\n3.4. The Relationship between VDR Gene Variants and Serum 25(OH)D Level\n\nThe effect of vitamin D is mediated through binding to a specific steroid receptor with the activity of a transcription factor, thus regulating the synthesis of protein actively participating in bone metabolism and maintaining calcium homeostasis. Variation in VDR gene may alter receptor functions, suggesting possible changes in serum 25(OH)D concentration. The relationship between VDR gene variants and serum 25(OH)D level is presented in Figure 3.\n\nWe revealed a statistically significant association of rs1544410, rs731236, and rs11568820 gene variants with the serum 25(OH)D level. The genetic effects of these three markers on baseline serum 25(OH)D level were gene/dose dependent. Interestingly, for rs1544410 (Figure 3B) and rs731236 (Figure 3",

The genetic effects of these three markers on baseline serum 25(OH)D level were gene/dose dependent. Interestingly, for rs1544410 (Figure 3B) and rs731236 (Figure 3C), the lowest 25(OH)D level was typical for the reference genotype, while it was intermediate for heterozygotes and the highest for the bearers of minor homozygous genotypes (ANOVA test p = 0.006 and p = 0.0005, respectively). For the bearers of the rs1544410 T/T genotype, the 25(OH)D concentration was 3.6 ng/mL higher compared to C/C genotypes (p FDR = 0.015), whereas for the bearers of the rs731236 G/G genotype, it was 4.6 ng/mL higher (p FDR = 0.0002). The opposite gene/dose relationship was revealed for the rs11568820 variant, when wild-type G/G homozygotes showed a higher 25(OH)D increase as compared to the A/G and A/A genotypes (Figure 3E).\n\nWe also assessed the distribution of each VDR variant of genotype in different groups of study participants according to vitamin D level (sufficient, insufficient, deficient). Using a two-tailed χ2 test, a statistically significant difference in genotype distribution between groups was revealed only for the rs731236 variant (χ2 = 12.8, p = 0.012, Figure 3F).

    "content": "Results\n\nThe clinical characteristics for all study subjects are summarized in Table 2, at the time of most recent echocardiogram. As noted, subjects were frequency matched according to age and gender. Furthermore, hypertensive subjects with and without CHF were frequency matched according to their duration of HTN. The study population was predominantly Caucasian, which matches the ethnic composition of the community (98% of PMRP participants report Northern European ancestry). As anticipated, the left ventricular mass index was higher (115.3 ± 36.1 g/m2) in the HTN+/CHF+ group than in the HTN+/CHF− group (101.5 ± 24.0 g/m2) and the HTN−/CHF− control group (88.7 ± 24.8 g/m2). Similarly, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was lowest, frequency of dilated cardiomyopathy (based upon diagnostic codes) was greatest, and devices such as implantable defibrillators and pacemakers were more common, within the HTN+/CHF+ groups (versus either the HTN+/CHF− group or the HTN−/CHF− controls).\n\nAllele frequencies are shown in Table 3 for the 13 SNPs genotyped in this study. For each polymorphism, genotype frequency was compared between hypertensive subjects and hypertensive subjects with CHF (primary analysis). Genotype frequency was also compared between the initial group (i.e., hypertensive subjects without CHF) and the nonhypertensive controls (secondary analysis). Hence, the odds ratio was calculated twice. As shown in Table 3, logistic regression revealed two significant associations across groups: one in the primary analysis (rs4646536 for HTN+/CHF+ vs HTN+/CHF−); and one in the secondary analysis (rs4646537 for HTN+/CHF− vs HTN−/CHF−). Although the possibility exists that these SNPs were associated by chance (i.e., since two hypotheses were tested repeatedly for 13 separate SNPs), the results remain significant after Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05) and it should be noted that both SNPs occur within the same gene, CYP27B1. Furthermore, the specific variant associated with CHF (rs4646536) has recently been shown to alter circulating levels of 25-OH vitamin D.\n\nFor rs4646536 (a SNP in the sixth intron of CYP27B1), the homozygous CC genotype was present at a frequency of 12.7% in the HTN+/CHF+ subjects, and a frequency of 8.7% in the HTN+/CHF− subjects. Homozygosity for the minor allele at rs4646536 was therefore associated with an increased risk for CHF in patients with HTN (odds ratio [OR]: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.05–4.39; p < 0.05). We therefore also abstracted the most recent echocardiogram for each of these subjects (n = 205 HTN+/CHF+ subjects, and n = 206 HTN+/CHF− subjects), and we tested the echocardiographic parameters for association with genotype at rs4646536. As shown in Table 4, these parameters included left atrial (LA) area, IVS thickness, left ventricular end systolic (LVES) dimension, LVED dimension, ejection fraction (EF) and posterolateral ventricular (PLV) wall thickness. None of these parameters differed according to rs4646536 genotype. A possible explanation for the absence of statistical significance is the low numbers of patients (21 controls, 18 HTN and 26 HTN and CHF) with the low abundance CC genotype. An alternative explanation might be the lack of uniformly ascertained echocardiographic data (the current data were abstracted from clinical records).\n\nNo other candidate gene polymorphism within the current study was associated with altered risk for CHF in the context of HTN (Table 3). Lack of association for markers in candidate genes beyond CYP27B1 should not be interpreted as conclusive evidence that the other genes are not important in the development and progression of CHF. A more comprehensive analysis of the linkage structure within each gene would be required before such a statement could be made.\n\nLastly, we made an effort to determine if any of the polymorphisms characterized within the current study are found more frequently in patients with HTN. This second analysis (HTN+/CHF− vs HTN−/ CHF−) revealed that an additional SNP in CYP27B1 was associated with altered risk for the development of HTN. For rs4646537 (a SNP in the eighth intron of CYP27B1), carrier status for the minor allele (heterozygous AC genotype) demonstrated protective effect against development of HTN (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.13–0.91, p < 0.05). The heterozygous genotype was noted in 3.9% of HTN+/CHF− subjects, and in 10.2% of the HTN−/CHF− controls. No subjects were homozygous for the minor allele at rs4646537. Furthermore, the mean systolic blood pressure of control subjects was 144 mmHg in this study (Table 2), suggesting that many of the controls may have had mild (undiagnosed) HTN. Thus, lack of association for markers in candidate genes beyond CYP27B1 should not be interpreted as conclusive evidence that the other genes are also not important in the development of HTN.",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nA total of 655 titles and 88 abstracts were analyzed. Eighty-two articles were excluded because they did not meet the eligibility criteria or because they were duplicates. A total of 262 studies were excluded because they included unhealthy individuals, which constituted the main cause of exclusion. Four cross-sectional studies and two clinical trials were included. The flowchart for the selection and inclusion of articles is shown in Figure 1 (PRISMA).\n\nCharacteristics of the studies\n\nThe study participants included in this review were located in different geographic locations, including North America, Europe, and Asia. The age range was 5-11 years. Three studies were identified with insufficient classification of vitamin D levels, and two studies included subjects with deficient vitamin D levels as defined by the International Life Science Institute of Brazil. The characteristics of the included studies are listed in Table 1.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME\n\nIt is important to note that vitamin D3 undergoes enzymatic conversion in the liver by vitamin D-25-hydroxylase to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). 25OHD is the main circulating form of vitamin D in the body.\n\nPossible relationships between handgrip strength (HGS) and vitamin D levels were analyzed in all studies, as shown in Table 2. In one study, serum vitamin D levels were not evaluated, although variants of the VDR gene were analyzed in relation to HGS. Wright et al. presented data that took into account the subjects' race and sex. In this study, white girls had higher levels of circulating 25OHD (80.5±6.1 nmol/L) than black girls (58.9±18.2 nmol/L) and white and black boys (79.8±3.0 nmol/L and 62.0±15.2 nmol/L, respectively). In relation to HGS, white girls showed less capacity to produce strength (148.08 N±77.47 N) compared with black girls (202.02±85.31 N) and black and white boys (223.59±70.60 N and 159.85±83.35 N). However, following vitamin D3 supplementation for 12 weeks, there were significant changes in HGS (1.8%±123.2%) and 25OHD levels (34.9%±55.9%); however, the HGS was not related to changes in 25OHD levels after vitamin D supplementation.\n\nFilteau et al. analyzed the possible association of HGS with supplementation of 25OHD during the first 6 months of life in children aged 5 years. They found that 43% of the children assessed had insufficient serum levels of 25OHD, and 40% had borderline serum levels of 25OHD. The average serum 25OHD level was 32.7±23.0 nmol/L. Children in this study had an average HGS of 24.41±9.12 N. The authors concluded that there was a weak association between the levels of 25OHD and HGS (25OHD [log ng/mL]=0.005[-0.23 to 0.24], p=0.96)\n\nTrilok-Kumar et al. studied the long-term effects of vitamin D supplementation using participants who were supplemented with vitamin D at 6 months of age in a previous study. They demonstrated that there were no significant differences between the supplementation and placebo groups in the children's performance in motor tests or HGS assessment. The HGS was 24.71±8.72 N for the group that received vitamin D supplementation and 24.02±9.51 N for the placebo group.\n\nTo determine whether muscle strength is associated with the plasma levels of 25OHD, Mortensen et al. analyzed 130 Danish white children who received vitamin D3 supplementation for 20 weeks. During this intervention, doses of 0, 10, or 20 μg/day were supplemented, giving rise to three different groups. Associations between muscle strength and the plasma levels of 25OHD were found through analyses stratified by sex before supplementation. A positive association between 25OHD and muscle strength (HGS) was observed in female children (p=0.005). After supplementation, all children had vitamin D levels ≥50 nmol/L and muscle strength did not differ between groups. Before supplementation, the HGS was 92.18±4.9 N (placebo group), 107.87±5.88 N (10 μg/day) and 106.89±4.90 (20 μg/day). After supplementation, the HGS was 98.06±5.88 N (placebo group), 112.78±5.88 N (10 μg/day) and 109.83±4.90 N (20 μg/day). In this study, there was no difference between the sexes in terms of muscle strength.\n\nAl-jwadi et al. found that serum 25OHD values were positively associated with HGS in both sexes (β=0.008, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.002, 0.014, p=0.013). However, in girls, there was a significant association (β=0.009, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.018; p=0.031), demonstrating an increase in serum 25OHD of 25 nmol/L resulted in an increase in HGS of 2.25 N. It is worth mentioning that the mean HGS value for these children was 82.76±16.96 N.\n\nBozsodi et al. determined the effect of VDR genotype on HGS and identified six VDR single nucleotide polymorph",

A significant association was observed between three SNPs (A012G, Bsml, and Taql) and HGS; the combination of “TT” alleles of the A1012G gene was related to higher levels of HGS, while the “CC” genotype was related to lower HGS levels. An increase in HGS of the dominant hand was related to the Bsml genotype “AA” (p=0.010) and Taql genotype “CC” (p=0.038). In addition, three VDR haplotypes were significantly associated with HGS in the dominant and non-dominant hands (p<0.005 and p<0.01, respectively).",

    "content": "Results\n\nAnalysis of chip quality\n\nTo ensure the quality of chips included in the study, we evaluated the original CEL files from the dataset GSE66175 to eliminate the chips with poor quality. The relative log expression boxplot showed that the central values of all samples were close to the Y-axis \"0\" and basically consistent, indicating that all samples were of high quality (Fig. 1). To further evaluate the chip quality, we plotted normalized unscaled standard errors boxplot, in which the standard errors of the samples were all close to the Y-axis \"1\" with small deviation, indicating that the chip quality was reliable and consistent with the results of the relative log expression boxplot (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The RNA degradation plot showed that the lines of each chip are roughly parallel, indicating that the chip quality is high, which can be used for subsequent data analysis (Additional file 1: Figure S2). We downloaded matrix file of dataset GSE90074 after quality control and preprocessing and integrated it with the dataset GSE66175, then a total of 160 samples (including 65 T2DM patients and 95 T2DM patients with CVD) were included in this study.\n\nTo ensure the quality of data analysis, we visualized the base quality distributions to check the data quality (Fig. 2). In addition, we filtered the raw data and performed data quality control. The quality control results were listed in Table 2.\n\nDifferential expression analysis and visualization\n\nDifferentially expressed genes were screened by differential expression analysis using limma and DESeq2 packages. The results showed that a total of 56 genes were significantly differentially expressed, among which 47 were up-regulated and 9 were down-regulated (Additional file 1: Table S2). Also, miRNAs were selected by differential expression analysis using DESeq2 packages. There were 16 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, among which 8 were up-regulated and 8 were down-regulated (Additional file 1: Table S3). Then, we plotted heatmap to visualize the results by using pheatmap package (Fig. 3a, b).\n\nMRNA-miRNA co-expression network\n\nPearson correlation analysis was performed to explore correlation of differentially expressed mRNA and miRNA, and the co-expression network was visualized, in which 19 mRNA (including 15 upregulated mRNA and 4 downregulated mRNA) and 12 miRNAs (including 5 upregulated miRNAs and 7 downregulated miRNAs) were included (Fig. 4). The let-7i-5p and miR-320c were both correlated to 6 genes.\n\nGO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis\n\nTo explore the potential biological functions of differentially expressed genes, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The GO results showed that the differentially expressed gene were most likely associated with plasma membrane, extracellular space and receptor activity (Fig. 5). KEGG results revealed that the biological functions of differentially expressed genes included B cell receptor signaling pathway and hematopoietic cell lineage (Table 3).\n\nMRNA-SNP-miRNA interaction network\n\nWe performed eQTL analysis to explore the association between SNP and mRNA expression level, then we found 60 mRNA and cis-eQTL pairs, and 44,454 mRNA and trans-eQTL pairs.We searched MirSNP and PolymiRTS 3.0 to obtain the SNPs related to differentially expressed miRNAs, eventually we screened 16,018 miRNA and SNP pairs including 16 differentially expressed miRNAs and 15,741 SNPs. Then SNPs related to differentially expressed miRNAs were matched with cis- and trans-eQTL, 16 mRNA-SNP-miRNA trios were obtained by overlapping SNPs. In addition, the effect and binding energy of 8 miRNA and SNP pairs in mRNA-SNP-miRNA trios were obtained (Additional file 1: Table S6). The results showed that rs17093783, rs2235364, rs1285935 and rs11562803 could enhance the binding region, rs2502607, rs325009 and rs11574860 could result in a decrease in the stability of the binding region, and rs17047863 could break the binding region. We also predicted the target mRNA of differentially expressed miRNA, and found that target mRNA of hsa-miR-581 included CEP41 which was consistent with the mRNA-SNP-miRNA trios. We visualized the relationship between 16 mRNA-SNP-miRNA trios and prediction of differentially expressed miRNA by using software Cytoscape 3.7.2 (Fig. 6).",

    "content": "3. Results\n\nThe sample was composed of 898 subjects, of which 65.5% were women and 34.5% were men. The mean age of the sample was 41 ± 12 years and the BMI 26.9 ± 4.65 kg/m2. About 62.14% of the volunteers presented excess weight (EW, BMI >25 kg/m2). Anthropometric, biochemical, physical activity, as well as dietary data of the participants according to their nutritional status is provided in the Appendix A section. A total of 799 subjects had dietary data available and 697 were considered according to Goldberg’s method. Finally, 84% were classified as plausible reporters (n = 585) and 16% as misreporters (n = 112). \n\nWhen the BMI was regressed on the Total Daily Energy Intake (TEI), a positive and significant association was observed (β = 0.00132, 95% CI = (0.000505,0.00213); p = 0.038). On the other hand, the percentages of macronutrient (CH, Pr, and Lip) as a percentage of TEI showed no significant associations with the BMI of the total participants (p > 0.05).\n\nIn terms of energy and macronutrient intake per meal (breakfast, morning snack, lunch, evening snack, dinner, and after dinner snack, morning and evening) no significant association with BMI was identified. Nevertheless, morning carbohydrate intake (%TEI) was associated with different markers of the glycemic profile: glycemia (β = −0.419, 95% CI = (−0.628, −0.21); p = 0.001), HOMA (β = −0.0443, 95% CI = (−0.0707, −0.0178); p = 0.014) and insulin (β = −0.181, 95% CI = (−0.288,−0.0743); p = 0.012) and lipid: LDL (β = −1.09, 95% CI = (−1.69,−0.488); p = 0.005) and TG (β = −0.813, 95% CI = (−1.32,−0.307); p = 0.022). \n\nTable 1 describes the main anthropometric and biochemical data of the sample split by genotypes of the rs3749474 polymorphism, as well as the p value of a linear model of the SNP as predictor adjusted by sex and age. Table 2 includes dietary data for the total and the time-of-day intakes (breakfast, morning snack, lunch, evening snack, dinner, and after dinner snack, morning and evening intake) in plausible reporters by genotypes. The p value of a linear model of the SNP as predictor adjusted by sex and age is also included. \n\nIn order to better understand the genetic dependence of the effect of the distribution of meals in the nutritional status, 21 different lineal models were developed to predict BMI. Each of them had an interaction term between the SNP and one of the following 7 evening variables: Evening Meal Energy, Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Lipids Intake, of the Total Daily Energy Intake [Eve MEI (%TEI), Eve CH (%TEI), Eve Pr (%TEI), and Eve Lip (%TEI)], and Evening Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Lipids Intake of the Meal Energy Intake [Eve CH (%MEI), Eve Pr (%MEI) and Eve Lip (%MEI)]. In addition, for each evening variable, three different genetic models for the SNP were tested: additive (ADD), co-dominant (COD), and dominant (DOM)). All the models were adjusted by sex, age, and physical activity (expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs). \n\nAfter multiple-test correction by Bonferroni method, a significant interaction was observed between the presence of the rs3749474 polymorphism in the additive model and the evening carbohydrate intake (p = 0.046) when predicting the BMI (Figure 1). The heterozygous subjects (CT) showed that for every 1% increase in carbohydrate intake of the total energy intake during evening hours, the BMI increased by 0.1529 kg/m2 (β = 0.1529, 95% CI = −0.0164,0.3227)) and the homozygotes for the risk allele (TT) showed an even greater variation, increasing the BMI by 0.3379 kg/m2 for each 1% increase in carbohydrate consumption during this time (β = 0.3379, 95% CI = (0.1689,0.5080)). However, the common homozygous (CC) did not experience statistic increases in the BMI, even showing a slight decrease in it (−0.0321 kg/m2), (β = −0.0321, 95% CI = (−0.1505,0.0862)). Moreover, no significant interaction with the remaining model variables was identified.",

    "content": "Results\n\nData Screening and Missing Data Analyses\n\nOf 1,274 adolescents who provided DNA samples at baseline, 933 who reported their binge drinking at both follow-ups were included in the genetic analysis and 731 who provided data of all key study information including psychological scales and personal network surveys in addition to DNA samples and binge drinking were included in the analysis for the final model with genetic, psychological, and personal network factors. The final set of significant SNPs in the multivariate logistic regression model was identical whether we used the sample with n = 933 or 731. Due to the significant reduction in the sample size at the second follow-up, we conducted a battery of tests to evaluate the effect of missing data on our results. None of these tests revealed any effect that would modify the main findings of this study. First, there were no significant differences in genetic factors related to missingness (i.e., the missingness appears to be completely at random based on bootstrap sampling results). To evaluate whether exclusion by casewise deletion was related to covariates, we also ran pairwise t-tests (for continuous) or tests of proportionality (for discrete data) to see whether exclusion versus inclusion differed in mean variation. Along the margins, excluded individuals appeared to be slightly more likely to have used alcohol at baseline. However, a test of equality of proportions demonstrates that this difference is not statistically significant (δ = 0.0397, χ2 = 2.1815, df = 1, p = .1397). We conclude that there were no substantive differences between those participants who were excluded and those who were included in the final analyses.\n\nParticipant Characteristics\n\nTable 1 presents the participant characteristics for adolescent binge drinkers and non–binge drinkers at the first and second follow-ups. About 6% (n = 43) and 9% (n = 66) of participants reported one or more binge drinking episodes in the past 30 days at the first and second follow-ups. Those who reported binge drinking at the first or second follow-up were more likely to be older (p < .01), report lower subjective social status (p ≤ .05), and report drinking alcohol at the first (p < .001) and second follow-up (p < .001) compared with those who did not report binge drinking at any of the two follow-ups.\n\nEffects of Genetic Variants on Changes in Binge Drinking\n\nAfter screening out 108 of the total 664 SNPs (54 of 316 candidate SNPs) with minor allele frequencies ≤5% or Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium test, 262 candidate SNPs and the total number of 556 SNPs were analyzed for the effects of the candidate genes on adolescent binge drinking. After adjusting for age, gender, and binge drinking at the first follow-up, each of the 27 SNPs was significantly associated with changes in binge drinking (p ≤ .05). The q-value was calculated to evaluate the false discovery rate from conducting 262 tests (≤0.112), and the results of 27 significant SNPs had less than 5% of the false discovery rate (q ≤ 0.05). Then, 531 SNPs, all 558 SNPs except the 27 significant SNPs, were reduced to two principal components that characterize the underlying genetic variation in our sample.\n\nThe multivariate logistic regression model with 27 SNPs as predictors, and binge drinking at the first follow-up, age, gender, subjective social status, and two principal components as controlling variables identified six SNP locations that remained significant at the p ≤ .05 level including rs2097628 (DBH), rs2224721 (HTR2A), rs591556 (TPH1), rs11178999 (TPH2), rs17110451 (TPH2), and rs7963717 (TPH2).\n\nEffects of Genetic, Psychological, and Personal Network Factors on Changes in Binge Drinking\n\nAs presented in Table 2, the final logistic regression analyses examined four models, including “Model 1” with genetic variants, “Model 2” with psychological traits, “Model 3” with personal network factors, and “Final Model” with genetic, psychological, and network factors. The final model with genetic, psychological, and personal network factors for binge drinking revealed that having the AA or AG variant of rs17110451 (TPH2) and having the CC or AC of rs7963717 (TPH2) were significantly associated with a 1.84 and 3 times increased risk for binge drinking, respectively. Having the AA or GA variant of rs11178999 (TPH2) was significantly associated with a 37% decreased risk for binge drinking. Among the psychological traits, both sensation seeking and impulsivity were associated with a 1.10 and 1.05 times increased chance of initiating binge drinking. Finally, having a greater fraction of peers who drink alcohol and peers who encourage alcohol drinking were significantly associated with 8.88 and 15.20 times increased risk for binge drinking, respectively. Having close ties with household members also remained significantly associated, with a 72% reduced risk for binge drinking.\n\nThe results of the final model were further verified after including only those who ever drank alcohol to see if having heterogeneous mixtures of never drinkers and moderate drinkers in the non–binge drinking status may have obscured the results. All the significant factors in the final model remained significant at p ≤ .05 after excluding never drinkers (n = 379).\n\nGender Moderation\n\nSignificant factors in the final model were further examined for moderation by gender. As presented in Fig. 1, gender appears to moderate the effect of the fraction of peers who drink (b = −1.597, p ≤ .05) though the main effects of gender remain insignificant after adding gender moderation effects.

As presented in Fig. 1, gender appears to moderate the effect of the fraction of peers who drink (b = −1.597, p ≤ .05) though the main effects of gender remain insignificant after adding gender moderation effects. Specifically, there is a greater effect of having a larger fraction of peers who drink on changes in binge drinking for boys than girls. Asymptotically, gender does not moderate the effect of peers on binge drinking until more than two-fifths of one’s peers drink and the overall effects sizes were small (i.e., x < 1e–4).\n\nCorrelations Among Genetic Variants, Psychological Traits, and Personal Network\n\nBecause there might be gene-by-trait or gene-by-social environment correlations among the genetic, psychological, and social factors for changes in binge drinking, the associations among genetic variants, psychological traits, and perceived personal network characteristics were explored. As presented in Table 3, having the TT or CT variant of rs591556 (TPH1) was significantly associated with higher levels of sensation seeking and impulsivity traits (ρ = −0.11, p < .01; ρ = −0.09, p ≤ .05). In addition, participants with the CC or AC variant of rs17110451 (TPH2) had fewer numbers of alcohol drinkers in their family network (ρ = −0.09, p ≤ .05) than those without. The rest of the SNPs were not associated with any psychological traits or personal network factors in the final model.",

    "content": "Results\n\nSimulations\n\nBoth population- and family-based association studies were simulated under varying allele frequencies, heritabilities and sample sizes. In each case, the power was estimated for four phenotypes: centred FEV, PPFEV, residuals from regressing FEV on relevant covariates and residuals from regressing PPFEV on relevant covariates. Simulated data were based on a real dataset and on the Knudson FEV prediction equation, with both unascertained and ascertained samples (Figure 1 and Supplementary Tables S1-4 (Tables 2-5)). In all cases, using FEV without adjustment was least powerful and within-study adjusted FEV most powerful. Results were similar for family-based and population-based simulations.\n\nWhen the data were generated to resemble the CAMP study population as closely as possible, the most powerful approach used the residuals from within-study adjustment of FEV, followed by within-study adjusted PPFEV, PPFEV and finally FEV. Within-study adjustment led to gains in power of up to 20.5 per cent in population-based analyses and up to 17.6 per cent in family-based analyses. To determine how much of the variance in FEVw and PPFEV was determined by covariates, we calculated the R2 from regressing FEV and PPFEV on height, weight and age under each of the simulation settings. Because the variance of the distribution of FEV was fixed in the simulations, covariates consistently explained 82-86 per cent of variance in FEV. Covariates still explained 22-26 per cent of the variation in PPFEV, which explains why within-study adjustment increased power more so than simply calculating PPFEV.\n\nWhen the data were simulated based on the FEV prediction equations, PPFEV, within-study adjustment of FEV and within-study adjusted PPFEV, all yielded approximately equal power, since the model assumed in the FEV prediction equation was truly the expected value of FEV. Covariates only explained 3 -8 per cent of the variation in PPFEV. Even in this case, where the confounding relationship between FEV and covariates was wholly explained by standard prediction equations, using within-study adjustment did not diminish power.\n\nThe results were similar when the samples were truncated to include only subjects with PPFEV ≥ 80 per cent. Power decreased overall owing to the decreased amount of variation in FEV, but the trends in power were the same as in the untruncated simulations. In fact, the within-study adjustment led to even greater gains in power in the truncated analyses: within-study adjustment led to gains in power of up to 23.3 per cent in population-based analyses and up to 20.4 per cent in family-based analyses.\n\nData analysis: Childhood Asthma Management Program\n\nWe demonstrated the four methods of confounder-adjustment using CAMP, a multicentre, randomised clinical trial including 1,041 children between five and 14 years of age with mild to moderate asthma. The present analysis included 711 geno-typed Caucasian trios. Each of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding interleukin 10 (IL-10), a gene previously associated with asthma, was tested for association with each of four lung-function phenotypes (FEV, PPFEV, within-study adjusted FEV and within-study adjusted PPFEV) (Table 1). Within-study adjustment was carried out, regressing FEV on age, sex, weight and height (all recorded at baseline). In a second analysis, all SNPs genotyped in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene, which is associated with BMI, were tested for association with six obesity phenotypes: weight, BMI and BMI z-scores (BMIZ), each with and without within-study adjustment. Weight was adjusted for age, sex and mean-centred height. BMI and BMIZ were adjusted for age and sex. Neither age nor sex was a significant predictor of BMIZ; as a result, using within-study adjusted BMIZ was equivalent to using unadjusted BMIZ in this dataset. For both analyses, the family-based association test (FBAT) statistic was used, assuming an additive genetic model. Regression models were fit using SAS version 9.1. All genetic association tests were performed by HelixTree version 5.1.3.\n\nAfter Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons, none of the six SNPs in IL-10 were significantly associated with any of the FEV-derived phenotypes (Figure 2). Height, weight, sex and age explained 83.82 per cent of the variation in FEV and 17.44 per cent of the variation in PPFEV. For the SNP previously associated with FEV, rs3024496, PPFEV residuals yielded the lowest p-value (p = 0.0135) followed by FEV residuals (p = 0.0317). The worst p-value for this SNP was obtained using PPFEV. As in simulations, the within-study adjusted phenotypes did best but, unlike in the simulations, adjusted PPFEV outperformed adjusted FEV and PPFEV did worse than FEV.\n\nNo SNPs in FTO were significant after Bonferroni correction. The SNP previously found to be associated with obesity, rs9939609, was not geno-typed in CAMP. Examining quantile-quantile plots of the -log10 p-values revealed that the association signal was readily apparent in BMIZ (and the equivalent within-study adjusted BMIZ) and somewhat apparent in within-study adjusted BMI (Figure 3).",

    "content": "Results\n\nWe first asked whether a variant in the taste receptor gene TAS2R38 was associated with eating behaviors as assessed by the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. We performed association analysis of the SNP rs1726866, a nonsynonymous coding SNP within TAS2R38 (T785C; Val262Ala), and the eating behaviors hunger, restraint and disinhibition. The “C” allele of rs1726866, the minor allele in the AFDS, is strongly associated with increased taste sensitivity to PROP/PTC. We observed no significant association between SNP genotype and the eating behaviors hunger or restraint. However, there was a significant association of the minor allele with decreased disinhibition (p = 0.03; Table 2). Because eating behaviors differ substantially between males and females (e.g.,), we subsequently performed sex-stratified analyses. Stratification of the cohort by gender revealed a strong association in females (p = 0.0002, Tables 2 & 3) but not in males (p = 0.86; Table 2 & 3). This significance value survived our correction to control for the increase in type I error associated with multiple comparisons (p = 0.02 Bonferroni corrected).\n\nTo define the extent of LD around rs1726866, we examined previously genotyped haplotype-tagging SNPs both upstream and downstream of TAS2R38 (Figure 1). We identified two LD blocks. The first (LD Block 1) contains four SNPs (rs11763979, rs2233998, rs2234001, and rs2227264), is found ∼182 kb upstream of rs1726866 and extends for 27 kb (Figure 1). SNP rs1726866 (TAS2R38) displays moderate LD with the SNPs in this block (r2 = 0.48 – 0.61; D′ = 0.73 – 0.80), but well less than the threshold for inclusion in the LD block (D′ ≥ 0.95). These SNPs were also significantly associated with disinhibition in female subjects, though the p-values of their association (ranging from p = 0.002 to p = 0.004) were at least an order of magnitude higher than that observed for rs1726866 (Table 4). Six other SNPs located ∼1.3 mb downstream of TAS2R38 show no LD with rs1726866, although two of them form a small LD block at the distal end of this cluster (LD Block 2; Figure 1).\n\nBecause of the large intergenic intervals between rs1726866 and some of these other SNPs, we sought to further refine the extent of LD around rs1726866 by examining several additional SNPs upstream and downstream of TAS2R38 in a subset of the AFDS (n = 550). These SNPs were genotyped previously using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100K Set. Four upstream SNPs showed little LD with rs1726866 (r2 = 0.0 - 0.44; Figure 2). The five SNPs located downstream of TAS2R38 also display little LD with rs1726866 (r2 = 0.0 - 0.18; Figure 2). Collectively, these data again suggest that variation in the bitter taste receptor gene TAS2R38 is principally responsible for the disinhibition association observed in female AFDS participants.\n\nThe eating behavior disinhibition is strongly related to BMI, particularly in women (e.g.,). However, we saw no association between variation at rs1726866 and BMI (p = 0.27). These results are consistent with previous reports indicating a lack of association between BMI and variation at TAS2R38.",

    "content": "Results\n\nGenetic analyses\n\nGenotyping participants for the rs1049353 SNP of the CNR1 gene coding for the CB1 receptor revealed 74 (53.2%) homozygous G allele, 4 (2.9%) homozygous A allele and 58 (41.7%) heterozygous G/A allele carriers. In line with previous studies (Agrawal et al.,; Mota et al.,) and due to the small number of homozygous A allele carriers, homo- and heterozygous carriers were treated as one group [62 AA/AG genotype carriers (44.6%)] and tested against homozygous G allele (GG genotype) carriers. Allele frequencies (minor allele frequency = 24.26%, major allele frequency = 75.74%) were in accordance with those documented by the National Center for Biotechnology Information for Europeans and in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (χ2(1) = 3.50, P = 0.061). GG and AA/AG genotype carriers were equally distributed in the stress (33 AA/AG genotype carriers, 38 GG genotype carriers) and control group (28 AA/AG genotype carriers, 33 GG genotype carriers; χ2(1) = 0.77, P = 0.381). Given that the genotypic distribution nearly violated Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and in light of different homozygous A allele frequencies reported in previous studies (Domschke et al.,; Agrawal et al.,), we reanalyzed our neuroimaging data without AA genotype carriers. Importantly, our results remained largely unchanged after excluding the AA genotype carriers (see Supplementary Material).\n\nSuccessful stress induction by the TSST\n\nSubjective mood, as well as blood pressure and cortisol concentrations significantly changed in response to the TSST and verified the successful stress induction. Independent of CNR1 genotype, exposure to the TSST was rated as significantly more difficult, unpleasant and stressful than the control manipulation (all F(1,132) ≥ 71.62, all P < 0.001; Table 1). In addition, GG genotype carriers of the rs1049353 SNP were overall more restless than AA/AG genotype carriers (F(1,130) = 4.92, P = 0.028). More importantly, however, independent of CNR1 genotype, participants’ mood decreased and they became increasingly restless in response to the TSST compared to the control condition (time × treatment: both F(2,129) ≥ 21.45, both P < 0.001; Table 1). Independent of CNR1 genotype and treatment condition, participants became increasingly tired during the course of the experiment (time: F(2,129) = 96.06, P < 0.001).\n\nExposure to the TSST, compared to the control condition, further led to a significant increase in cortisol concentrations (time × treatment: F(3,130) = 17.73, P < 0.001; Figure 1A), which provides evidence for a stress-induced activation of the HPA axis. Stress-induced increases in salivary cortisol were not affected by CNR1 genotype (all main and interaction effects: all F ≤ 0.82, all P ≥ 0.368). Finally, activity of the autonomic nervous system significantly increased in response to the TSST, but not after the control manipulation, as was shown by significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (time × treatment: both F ≥ 17.51, both P ≤ 0.001). Although systolic blood pressure was not influenced by CNR1 genotype (time × genotype: F(3,129) = 1.43, P = 0.236; genotype: F(1,131) = 0.55, P = 0.460; Figure 1B), a time × treatment × genotype interaction for diastolic blood pressure (F(3,129) ≥ 3.49, P = 0.018) showed that in rs1049353 GG genotype carriers, diastolic blood pressure increased during and immediately following the stress induction (both F(1,72) ≥ 7.57, both P ≤ 0.008), whereas in AA/AG genotype carriers no such effect was observed (both F(1,59) ≤ 1.15, both P ≥ 0.287; Figure 1C).\n\nNeural correlates of affective picture processing\n\nAs expected, pictures that were a priori classified as negative were rated as significantly more negative (mean = 1.6, s.d. = 0.39) than those that had been classified as neutral (mean = 3.57, s.d. = 0.42; F(1,130) = 1033.02, P < 0.001; Table 2). The experimental manipulation (stress vs control) and the CNR1 genotype had no influence on these emotionality ratings (all F ≤ 0.77, all P ≥ 0.381). With respect to reaction times, participants were faster to respond to neutral than negative pictures (F(1,129) = 5.28, P = 0.023), which is in line with previous studies showing that emotional stimuli automatically capture our attention and are, for example, viewed longer than neutral pictures (Hajcak et al.,), which might indicate more in-depth processing of negative material as is",

In addition, GG genotype carriers rated the pictures, irrespective of picture emotionality, faster than AA/AG genotype carriers (F(1,129) = 4.04, P = 0.047).\n\nIn line with previous findings (van Stegeren,; van Stegeren et al.,; Etkin et al.,), negative (vs neutral) picture processing led overall to significant increases in activation in brain regions associated with affective processing and emotion regulation. Specifically, irrespective of stress and CNR1 variant, the presentation of negative pictures increased bilateral activation of the amygdala (right: t = 10.81, PFWE < 0.001, k = 84; left: t = 10.68, PFWE < 0.001, k = 64), vlPFC (right: t = 6.01, PFWE < 0.001, k = 36, left: t = 4.74, PFWE < 0.001, k = 46), vmPFC (right: t = 6.07, PFWE < 0.001, k = 114; left: t = 6.31, PFWE < 0.001, k = 138) and insula (right: t = 8.78, PFWE < 0.001, k = 122), with the left insula even surviving FWE correction at whole-brain level (left: t = 11.59, PFWE < 0.001, k = 2,053). In addition, the occipital inferior gyrus (left: t = 12.33, PFWE < 0.001, k = 1,242) and anterior parietal regions [post-central gyrus (right: t = 17.74, PFWE < 0.001, k = 1,226), supramarginal gyrus (left: t = 6.15, PFWE < 0.001, k = 20)], which have been associated with emotional arousal and the regulation of an individual’s internal state (`as-if-body-loop’; Damasio et al.,; Anders et al.,), were more strongly activated when negative pictures were presented (Table 3). No brain regions were stronger activated during neutral compared to negative picture presentation.\n\n CNR1 genotype modulates prefrontal activity and connectivity with the amygdala during affective picture processing\n\nCorroborating earlier studies that emphasized an essential role of eCBs in the maintenance of emotional homeostasis in the face of a stressor (Lutz,; McLaughlin et al.,), the rs1049353 SNP modulated brain activation in response to negative (vs neutral) pictures under stress. Specifically, we observed an interaction between treatment (stress vs control) and CNR1 genotype (rs1049353 AA/AG vs GG genotype) on vmPFC activity for negative vs neutral pictures (left: t = 3.55, PFWE = 0.034, k = 24; Figure 2A). Post-hoc tests revealed that under stress, AA/AG compared to GG genotype carriers showed enhanced activity of the vmPFC (left: t = 3.64, PFWE = 0.035, k = 22), whereas there were no genotype-dependent effects in the control condition. No main effects of CNR1 genotype or treatment were observed, nor were any other brain areas significantly modulated by CNR1 genotype or treatment (no suprathreshold clusters).\n\nIn order to gain insight into the network structure underlying the modulatory effect of the CNR1 genotype on stress-induced changes in neural affective processing, we performed, in a next step, functional connectivity analyses. These analyses revealed a significant CNR1 genotype × treatment interaction for the coupling of the vlPFC and the amygdala (t = 3.43, PFWE = 0.013, k = 27). As displayed in Figure 2B, AA/AG compared to GG genotype carriers showed significantly increased vlPFC-amygdala connectivity under no-stress control conditions during negative picture processing (t = 3.76, PFWE = 0.007, k = 38), whereas genotype groups did not differ after stress (no suprathreshold clusters).\n\nMemory performance in AA/AG genotype carriers correlates with activation of and connectivity between limbic areas after stress\n\nPerformance in the surprise free recall test 24 h after picture presentation was overall rather moderate (participants recalled on average 20 ± 8% of all pictures). As expected, memory was significantly better for negative (mean = 6, s.d. = 2) than for neutral pictures (mean = 3, s.d. = 2; F(1,130) = 203.98, P < 0.001; Table 2). Performance in",

Performance in the recognition task was overall very high, with an average hit rate of 88% and a false alarm rate of only 15%. In line with the free recall data, we observed superior recognition memory for negative items (increased hit rate, reduced false alarm rate; all F(1,129) ≥ 25.46, all P < 0.001; Table 2). An increased sensitivity index d′ (F(1,129) = 140.53, P < 0.001) and higher confidence ratings (F(1,129) = 99.68, P < 0.001) for negative relative to neutral pictures lent further support for the emotional memory enhancement (Table 2). Importantly, recall and recognition performance for negative and neutral pictures as well as confidence ratings were unaffected by stress and CNR1 genotype (all F ≤ 2.49, all P ≥ 0.117).\n\nIn order to investigate whether the neural underpinnings of emotional memory formation were affected by stress and the CNR1 polymorphism, we correlated brain activity for negative compared to neutral items during encoding with the 24 hour-delayed memory performance for negative pictures. Since free recall performance was rather moderate and variance was small, we used the sensitivity index d′ in our correlation analyses. In line with a crucial role of limbic brain regions in the processing of and memory formation for emotional material (McGaugh,; LaBar and Cabeza,), our analyses revealed overall significant clusters in the amygdala (left: t = 2.85, PFWE = 0.046, k = 10), insula (right: t = 4.24, PFWE = 0.001, k = 113; left: t = 4.52, PFWE = 0.001, k = 90) and hippocampus (left: t = 3.76, PFWE = 0.008, k = 36) during negative compared to neutral picture presentation. These clusters were positively correlated with participants’ memory performance for negative pictures (amygdala: left: r = 0.310, P < 0.001; insula: right: r = 0.310, P = 0.001, left: r = 0.275, P = 0.001; hippocampus: r = 0.209, P = 0.016). Importantly, the neural correlates of emotional memory enhancement were modulated by stress and CNR1 genotype. Specifically, we observed that in stressed AA/AG genotype carriers emotional memory performance positively correlated with clusters in the amygdala (left: t = 4.24, PFWE = 0.003, k = 28; r = 0.571, P = 0.001), insula (left: t = 4.13, PFWE = 0.012, k = 62; r = 0.555, P = 0.001, right: t = 3.61, PFWE = 0.039, k = 26; r = 0.571, P = 0.001) and hippocampus (left: t = 4.16, PFWE = 0.009, k = 56; r = 0.468, P = 0.006; Figure 3A). In contrast, no such correlations were found in stressed GG genotype carriers (no suprathreshold clusters, all r ≤ 0.289, P ≥ 0.108). In the control condition, however, there were no significant clusters that were activated during negative picture encoding and that correlated with emotional memory performance in AA/AG genotype carriers (no suprathreshold clusters, all r ≤ 0.247, P ≥ 0.215), whereas in GG genotype carriers emotional memory performance was positively correlated with activation of the insula (right: t = 4.22, PFWE = 0.008, k = 14; r = 0.455, P = 0.004; Figure 3B). After controlling for multiple comparisons by dividing α by the number of correlations calculated (0.05 / 4), all clusters and correlations but the cluster in the right insula remained significant at a corrected α threshold of P < 0.0125. In support of CNR1 genotype-dependent differences in the neural basis of emotional memory formation, the correlations between emotional memory performance and activation of limbic brain regions during negative compared to neutral picture encoding significantly differed between AA/AG and GG genotype carriers in the stress (amygdala and insula: both z between −2.06 and −1.61, P ≤ 0.054) and control condition (insula: z = 2.72, P = 0.003).\n\nIn addition to the activation of single brain regions, we analyzed how functional connectivity patterns during negative picture encoding may relate to later memory performance.

The odds of consuming milk was higher for the ‘T’ allele carriers of the LCT variant (SNP rs4988235) compared to the CC homozygotes (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.57–2.93, P = 1.68 × 10−6 for the 1958BC; OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.34, P = 3.0 × 10−4 for the UK Biobank). In the UK biobank, 1.83% of ‘TT’ carriers followed a lactose free diet compared to 1.77% and 2.40% in CT and CC carriers, respectively (P = 7.6 × 10−5). The observed patterns of milk consumption varied strongly by age, sex, social or lifestyle factors such as annual income, education, health status, smoking and alcohol and coffee consumption, while no notable imbalances were observed by LCT genotype (Supplementary Table 2). Furthermore, check against the GWAS catalogue (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/), confirmed the association between LCT rs4988235 and BMI (P = 2 × 10−6), with no other pleiotropic associations reported.\n\nPhenotypic associations\n\nIn the 1958BC, there was no significant association between high milk intake and cardiometabolic traits (P > 0.09) (Table 2). In the UK Biobank, there was an association of high milk intake with higher BMI (P = 3.72 × 10−124), SBP (P = 1.06 × 10−6), DBP (P = 0.009), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P = 1.20 × 10−19), TC (P = 2.75 × 10−12), triglycerides (P = 8.33 × 10−19), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 2.90 × 10−35) and lower HDL-C (P = 8.31 × 10−6) and HbA1c (P = 7.96 × 10−14). Meta-analysis of the data from 1958BC and UK Biobank showed that there was an association of high milk intake with lower HDL-C (P = 2.70 × 10−6) and higher triglycerides (P = 0.001) and CRP (P = 2.60 × 10−30).\n\nAssociation of the LCT gene variant with cardio-metabolic traits\n\nThe ‘T’ allele indexing greater milk intake had a consistent association with higher BMI in the UK Biobank (P = 2.73 × 10−7), GIANT consortium (P = 0.001), and the meta-analysis (Pmeta-analysis = 4.68 × 10−12) (Table 2). In contrast, LCT genotype was not associated with BMI adjusted waist circumference (WC) (indicator for central adiposity, Pmeta-analysis = 0.49).\n\nAll individual studies with available data showed an inverse association between LCT genotype indexing greater milk intake and lower serum LDL-C (Pmeta-analysis = 2.08 × 10−26), HDL-C (Pmeta-analysis = 9.40 × 10−13), and total cholesterol concentrations (Pmeta-analysis = 2.38 × 10−36) (Table 2). None of the genetic associations between the ‘T’ allele indexing higher milk intakes and SBP, DBP, and HbA1c were statistically significant (Pmeta-analysis > 0.11). Information for CRP was only available for the 1958BC and UK Biobank (Pmeta-analysis = 0.49).\n\nAnalyses in the UK Biobank confirmed the association between LCT variant and a higher total body fat percentage (P = 1.63 × 10−7), with a consistent association with higher fat-% noted across all indicators of regional fat distribution (Table 3). The estimates from these genetic associations were used in the IV ratio analysis, which confirmed the causal association of high milk intake with higher total body fat (P = 2.40 × 10−4), leg fat (P = 2.59 × 10−4), arm fat (P = 4.27 × 10−4) and trunk fat (P = 3.01 × 10−4).\n\nIn the UK Biobank, there was an association of the ‘T’ allele with T2D (P = 0.007), where ‘T’ allele carriers had 11% lower risk of diabetes; but the associations of LCT variant with CVD was not statistically significant (P = 0.302) (Table 4). However, in consortia look-up, there was no evidence for the association of LCT variant with T2D in the DIAGRAM consortium (P = 0.201) but there was an association with CAD in the CARDIoGRAM consortium (P = 0.030), where ‘T’ allele carriers had 14% lower risk of CAD.\n\nUsing the estimates taken from the results of meta-analysis in Table 2 and estimates of",

    "content": "Results\n\nSample Characteristics\n\nThe treatment and placebo arms did not differ in social class or maternal education, verbal and nonverbal intellectual competence, perceived stress, depression, or nutritional status (Table 1). About 30% of both groups were poorly nourished based on their dietary caloric intake, and more than 70% did not meet the AI for dietary choline intake. There were no group differences in alcohol consumption, which was very heavy for both groups at time of conception (≈10.0 standard drinks/occasion on an average of 2–3 days/week). Women in both arms continued to drink heavily across pregnancy (≈8–9 drinks/occasion) but reduced their frequency to about 1–2 days/week. Both groups smoked about ¼ pack/day on average, and cigarettes/day was only slightly higher among those in the choline group. Use of illicit drugs other than marijuana was rare; none of the women reported using cocaine, heroin, or methaqualone. Although women who used methamphetamine were excluded at time of recruitment, 4 reported using it later in pregnancy (2 choline, 2 placebo). There were no group differences in weeks gestation at time of booking, initial screening, or randomization or duration of choline supplementation. Weeks gestation at randomization ranged from 8.6–26.0 (Median=20.0); duration of choline supplementation ranged from 9–27 weeks (Median=18.6). The groups differed on sex of infant, with more girls in the choline and more boys in the placebo arm. There were no group differences in infant age at the 6.5- and 12-month assessments.\n\nEyeblink Conditioning\n\nAmong the 48 infants with usable EBC data, a larger proportion of the choline group met criterion for conditioning compared with the placebo group, although the effect fell short of conventional levels of statistical significance (Table 2). When the four infants whose mothers’ adherence was very poor (<20%) were excluded from the analysis, the effect was significant despite the smaller sample size; two-thirds of choline-treated infants met criterion for conditioning, compared with only one-third of the placebo group. When percent CRs in the two arms was examined across the three sessions, there was a main effect for session, F(2,60)=32.66, p<0.001, but not for treatment, F(1,30)=0.19, p>0.20 (Fig. 4). The infants in the choline arm showed a significantly greater increase in percent CRs across the three sessions than the placebo group (group by session interaction, F(2,60)=4.85, p<0.01.\n\nThe relation between protocol adherence and percent CRs in Session 3 for the choline treatment group is shown in Figure 5. An analysis of Mahalanobis distance identified one bivariate maternal outlier (p<0.007) with very poor adherence and high percent CRs. When that outlier was removed from the analysis, there was a clear linear relation between degree of adherence and conditioning by Session 3, r=0.63, p<0.01. By contrast, adherence was not related to percent CRs in the placebo group, r=−0.14, p>0.20.\n\nGestational Age and Somatic Growth\n\nThe majority of the women (93.7%) had full-term pregnancies, and GA did not differ between groups (Table 3). Although low birthweight (<2500 g) was common (26.1%), the incidence (choline 25.0%, placebo 32.3%) was similar between arms, χ2(1)=0.41, p=0.524. There were also no significant group differences in birth size. With the exception of length in the placebo group, birth percentile measures were markedly below the 50th percentile, likely due to the high levels of alcohol to which this cohort was exposed.\n\nAmong infants in the placebo arm, z-scores and percentiles for weight, length, and head circumference decreased from birth to 6.5 months (Table 3), which is consistent with our previous studies in Detroit and Cape Town that found worsening of fetal alcohol growth restriction in the 1st year of life. By contrast, infants in the choline arm demonstrated considerable catch-up growth in weight and head circumference by 6.5 months, which continued to be evident at 12 months. In repeated measures analyses examining the percentiles, the choline group showed significantly greater increases across this age period than the placebo group in weight, F(2,116)=4.85, p=0.009, and head circumference, F(2,116)=5.40, p=0.006. Group differences were not significant for the raw weight (kg), length (cm), and head circumference (cm) measures, presumably because the choline arm contained a higher proportion of females, who tend to be smaller than males.\n\nFagan Test of Infant Intelligence\n\nInfants in the choline treatment arm performed more optimally on the FTII than placebo infants at 12 months, with higher novelty preference scores, indicating better visual recognition memory function (Table 4). The Cohen’s d measure indicates a moderate-to-large effect size. The moderate effect size for the processing speed measure suggests that this effect might be significant in a larger sample.\n\nFASD Diagnosis\n\nWithin the choline arm, 8 infants met criteria for FAS and 2 for PFAS (32.3%), compared with 5 who met criteria for FAS and 2 for PFAS (22.6%) in the placebo arm, χ2(1)=0.73, p=0.393.\n\nImpact of Maternal Dietary Choline Status\n\nOnly 9.7% (3 choline-treated,",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nPopulation Characteristics\n\nThe final sample included 569 case families and 1,644 control-families. The distribution of the sub-phenotypes of OHDs among 569 cases is displayed in Figure 1. Table I summarizes the maternal demographics and behaviors for case and control-families respectively. Case mothers were marginally older (28.3 years vs. 27.5 years, respectively), and more likely to be overweight or obese than control mothers. The race-ethnicity distribution showed small differences with more Caucasian (non-Hispanic) and African-American case mothers than control mothers (73% vs. 69%, and 11% vs. 9%, respectively).\n\nGenetic variants only\n\nA total of 877 SNPs within 60 genes were included in the final analysis. Maternal genotypes for six SNPs from four genes [Cystathionine Gamma-Lyase (CTH); methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR); O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1)] were identified to be significantly associated with the occurrence of OHDs based on G Model (Table II). Similarly, infant genotypes for 24 SNPs from 13 genes [MTHFR; transcobalamin II (TCN2); betaine--homocysteine S-methyltransferase 2 (BHMT2); glutaredoxin (thioltransferase) (GLRX); betaine--homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT); CTH; superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2); glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (GCLC); nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3); folate receptor 1 (FOLR1); MGMT; RFC1; and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR)] were identified to be significantly associated with the occurrence of OHDs (Table II). The maternal genotype for the SNP rs1801133 within the MTHFR gene was identified to be significant (BFDP=0.63). The risk of delivering infants with OHDs among women carrying one T allele for rs1801133 was estimated to be 1.28 (95% CI: 1.08–1.51) times more than that among women carrying no copy of the T allele. Accordingly, the risk among women carrying two T alleles for rs1801133 was 1.64 (95% CI: 1.17–2.28) times the risk among those carrying no copy of the T allele. As mentioned above, the estimated RR (95% CI) for carrying two copies of the risk allele was the square of the estimated RR (95% CI) for carrying one copy of the risk allele with 0 copies of the risk allele as the reference group. For simplicity, only the estimated RR (95% CI) for carrying one copy of the risk allele compared to 0 copies was reported in the following results.\n\nThe infant genotype for the same SNP was found to be significantly associated with the risk of OHDs with opposing effects. The risk of OHDs among infants carrying one T allele was estimated to be 31% (95% CI: 16%–44%) less than those carrying no copy of the T allele. Besides, infant genotypes for 3 SNPs (rs9621049, rs4820886, rs4820887) within TCN2 gene and 5 SNPs (rs1422086, rs557302, rs625879, rs526264, rs542721) within BHMT2 gene were found to have BFDP < 0.8. Among them, rs9621049 within TCN2 and rs1422086 within BHMT2 were the SNPs with the smallest BFDP within their respective gene. The infant AG genotype for rs9621049 increased the risk of OHDs by 53% (95% CI: 1.21–1.93) compared to the GG genotype (BFDP=0.27). Similarly, the risk of OHDs increased by 32% (95% CI 1.11–1.58) for infants’ carrying AC genotype for rs1422086 compared to those carrying AA genotype (BFDP=0.44).\n\nGenetic variants and folic acid supplementation\n\nMaternal use of folic acid supplements may modify the impact of either maternal or infant genetic variants, or both. The interactive effects between maternal use of folic acid supplements and genetic variants may not be evident when evaluating the main effects of genetic variants only. Although maternal uses of folic acid supplements were similar in case (58%) and control (55%) mothers, the proportion of folic acid supplement use was significantly different among different race/ethnicity groups (p < 0.001), with 65% (n=1004) non-Hispanic Caucasian users compared to 33% (n=68) African-American users and 33% (n=116) Hispanic users. Given the lower numbers of African-American and Hispanic women, G × E Model was fit to evaluate interaction between each SNP and folic acid supplement use among Caucasians only.\n\nMaternal genotypes for 11 SNPs in betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT and BHMT2) and infant genotypes for two SNPs in BHMT gene significantly associated with OHDs through interactions with folic acid supplement use (Table III).

For example, folic acid supplement users who carried the AG genotype for rs557302 had an increased risk of delivering infants with OHDs compared to those carrying the GG genotype (RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.12–1.74). In contrast, no significant difference was found among women who did not use folic acid supplements (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55–1.01). Relative risks of OHDs for infants carrying AG genotype for rs557302 (compared to AA) showed that among mothers who used folic acid supplements, the risk of OHDs was reduced by 32% (95% CI: 14%–46%). Seven out of nine significant SNPs in the BHMT2 gene were determined to be in high LD (D′ ≥0.96) (Fig 2). Multiple SNPs (e.g. rs557302) were also found to be significantly associated with OHD risk based on the G Models.\n\nGenetic variants and obesity\n\nMaternal obesity has been found to play an important role in cardiogensis and the occurrence of CHDs in many published studies. In our analyses, a main effect of the association between OHDs and pre-pregnancy obesity compared to normal weight resulted in a RR=1.37 (95% CI: 1.15–1.63; p=0.001). To evaluate how maternal obesity modified the association between OHDs and genetic variants, G × E Model was fit to evaluate the interaction between each SNP and pre-pregnancy obesity.\n\nWe identified maternal genotypes for 19 SNPs and infant genotypes for 32 SNPs that interacted with pre-pregnancy obesity to increase the risk of OHDs (Table IV and Fig 3). Among these 51 SNP × obesity interactions, there were 10 interactions for which genetic variants appeared to be protective against OHD in normal weight women yet putative among obese women. In the remaining 41 interactions, the risk of OHD was increased among obese women who did not carry the wild type genotype. Among 19 significant maternal SNPs, rs761142 in the GCLC gene had the smallest interactive BFDP=0.56, 3 other SNPs on the same gene (rs572494, rs1555906, rs13212365) had a BFDP <0.80. Obese women carrying the AC genotype for rs761142 had a 57% (95% CI: 1.14–2.15) increased risk of having infants with OHDs compared to those carrying the AA genotype. The remaining significant maternal SNPs were present in the following genes: glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT); DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B); glutathione synthetase (GSS); microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 (MGST1); MGMT;, methionine adenosyltransferase I, alpha (MAT1A); serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1), and; glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2).\n\nInfant SNPs found to be significantly associated with OHDs through interactions with pre-pregnancy obesity are displayed in the bottom panel Table IV and Figure 4. We identified 11 SNPs in the DNMT3B gene; four SNPs in the GCLC gene; three SNPs in the GLRX gene; three SNPs in the tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1 (TRDMT1) gene; two SNPs in the GSS gene, and; one SNP in the remaining genes including MGMT, glutathione reductase (GSR), glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1), microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 (MGST1), BHMT, superoxide dismutase 3 extracellular (SOD3), DNA-methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A), methionine adenosyltransferase II, alpha (MAT2A), NOS3; and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1, methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFD1) genes respectively. The most significant infant SNP × obesity interaction was that with the SNP rs6058893 among obese women; this SNP was within the DNMT3B gene and its BFDP equaled to 0.15. Among obese women, infant AG genotype for rs6058893 was associated with elevated relative risk of OHDs by 1.73 (95% CI: 1.28–2.34) compared to the GG genotype. In contrast, among normal-weight women, infants with AG genotype for rs6058893 had a reduced risk of OHDs with a RR=0.75 (95% CI: 0.58–0.97) compared to infants of normal weight women who carried the GG genotype. There was no significant main effect of any of the SNPs discussed above. Eleven out of 13 significant maternal or infant SNPs in the DNMT3B gene were determined to be in high LD (D′ ≥0.9) (Figure 5).

Two hundred fifty patients met the criteria for severe UC, 273 had moderate UC, and 78 were included in the mild UC group. The clinical and endoscopic characteristics for the overall UC group and for each disease severity group are described in Table 2 and Table 3. None of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics at diagnosis (Table 2) were associated with increased severity. However, extensive disease (Montreal E3) on the initial endoscopy was more frequent in the moderate and severe groups (13% versus 21% versus 30% in mild, moderate, and severe UC, respectively, P = 0.001). Active smoking at diagnosis was more frequent in the mild group versus the moderate or severe group, although this trend did not reach statistical significance. When we compared severe UC with the combined group of mild and moderate UC (Table 4), patients with severe UC were more likely to be >40 years old and have extensive disease (OR of 1.66 and 2.12, respectively, P ≤ 0.02). On multivariate analysis, Montreal E3 was associated with severe UC (OR = 2.12; 95% CI, 1.39—3.24; P = 0.0005). Age >40 at diagnosis was also associated with severe UC (OR = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.15–3.25; P = 0.01). Neither active smoking nor ethnicity or a family history of IBD was associated with disease severity.\n\nWhen we evaluated longitudinal disease activity patterns, a shorter time to oral steroid initiation, to colectomy, and to proximal extension on follow-up endoscopy were all associated with increased severity (Table 3). There were also significant differences in response to biological therapy between the moderate and severe groups. Effective long-term response rates to biologics was 64% (29 of 48) in moderate UC and only 29% (13 of 45) in severe UC (P = 0.002). However, there were no differences among the groups with respect to response to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine.\n\nSerological Markers and Disease Severity\n\nSerum markers were analyzed in 139 subjects in whom samples were available and never had a colectomy and those with a colectomy where serum was taken before surgery. The proportion of patients with positive tests for pANCA, ASCA IgA and IgG, anti-OmpC, and CBir1 were similar in mild UC (n = 24), moderate UC (n = 83), and severe UC (n = 32) (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/IBD/A933 ). When the median titers of each serum marker were compared between the mild, moderate, and severe groups, there were no significant differences in pANCA, ASCA, and anti-OmpC titers. However, compared with mild UC, patients with moder ate and severe UC had higher median titers of anti-CBir1 (P = 0.003). There were also no differences between the severity groups when assessing the distribution of patients with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 positive markers.\n\nGenetic Markers and UC Severity\n\nGenetic data were available for 465 patients (severe UC = 192, moderate and mild UC = 273). None of the genotyped loci on Immunochip were significantly associated with severe UC when compared with mild and moderate UC; SNPs with significance levels of P ≤ 1× 10−5 are reported in Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/IBD/A934. Of the 163 SNPs from Jostins et al., rs9264942 (upstream of HLA-C on chromosome 6) had the most significant uncorrected P-value of 0.004. Genetics data were available for 282 patients with UC requiring colectomy (designated previously as MRUC) and 184 non-MRUC patients. None of the loci on Immunochip were associated with MRUC. Of the 37 SNPs previously reported by Haritunians et al in their study of MRUC, the most significant SNP, rs2831462, has an uncorrected P-value of 0.004.\n\nMarkers at Diagnosis and Proximal Extension of UC\n\nComplete data on endoscopic extent at diagnosis were available for 409 patients. One hundred forty-two patients had extensive disease at diagnosis and thus were excluded from this analysis. Of the 286 patients with limited colitis (Montreal E1 or E2) at their initial endoscopy, 174 progressed to have proximal disease (Montreal E3) on the last follow-up endoscopy and 112 continued to have only limited endoscopic disease extent. None of the clinical characteristics at diagnosis were associated with proximal disease extension (Table 5). When evaluating genetic markers and endoscopic disease extension, genetic data were available for 90 cases with limited colitis at the last follow-up and 140 who progressed to Montreal E3. None of the genotyped loci on Immunochip and none of the 163 IBD-associated regions were significantly associated with endoscopic extension.

    "content": "Results\n\nTα1 improves inflammation and immune tolerance in CF\n\nInflammation plays a critical role in lung disease development and progression in CF. IDO1, known to inhibit pathogenic Th17-cell activation and to initiate immune-tolerance mechanisms in the lungs, is defective in subjects with the p.Phe508del-CFTR mutation. Consistent with an ability to induce IDO1 via TLR9 signaling, Tα1 promoted TLR9 co-localization in lysosomes (Fig. 1a), where maturation and signalling of TLR9 occur in response to stimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides. Concomitantly, Tα1 rescued defective IDO1 expression in an airway epithelial cell line (CFBE41o-) stably expressing p.Phe508del-CFTR (Fig. 1b). In doing so, Tα1 reduced pro-inflammatory NF-κB activity in response to the TLR-2 ligand MALP-2 (Fig. 1c,d) and promoted IRF3 phosphorylation and expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, (Fig. 1e), which are both known to contribute to immune tolerance in the lung. Tα1 also rescued defective IDO1 expression, when administered in vivo to homozygous F508del-Cftr C57BL/6 mice (CftrF508del/F508del, hereafter referred to as CftrF508del mice) infected with Aspergillus fumigatus, which colonizes CF airways and contributes to chronic lung disease. Mice received Tα1 either intraperitoneally or intranasally (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), soon after the infection or in an established infection model (Supplementary Fig. 1c-e), daily for 6 days at 200 μg/kg, a dose previously shown to exert therapeutic activity in preclinical settings and to approximate, on a weight-per-weight basis, Tα1 doses that can be safely administered to humans. Tα1 restored IDO1 expression both basally and after infection (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 1a) and concomitantly reduced caspase-1 cleavage (Fig. 1g) and NLRP3 expression (insets of Fig. 1h), thus reducing inflammasome activity. At the same time, it reduced lung pathology in naïve and infected mice (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1d), fungal colonization (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Fig. 1c), and neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 1j and Supplementary Fig. 1b,e). The inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-17A were all reduced, and IL-10 as well as IL-1Ra increased by Tα1 (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Fig. 1b,e), which suggests that Tα1— via IDO1 induction—may also restrain pathogenic inflammasome activity in CF. Similar results were obtained in Cftr+/– and Cftr–/– mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a-d), indicating that the anti-inflammatory activity of Tα1 occurs independently from CFTR expression and function. Tα1 also restrained inflammation and lung colonization in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (Supplementary Fig. 2e-g), indicating that it might favorably affect CF lung microbiology.\n\nA limited but significant increase in body weight was afforded by Tα1 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3a), and this prompted us to examine the effects of Tα1 on gut morphology in the mutant mice, also considering that loss-of-function mutations of Cftr cause a predominantly intestinal phenotype. Similar to what was observed in the lung, Tα1 rescued IDO1 expression, tissue architecture, barrier function and cytokine balance in the small intestine of CftrF508del mice (Supplementary Fig. 3b-e). This further suggested that Tα1, by impacting on CF inflammation and microbiology, favorably alters the natural history of the disease.\n\nTα1 improves the localization and stability of mutant CFTR\n\nInfection and inflammation may produce secondary alterations in CFTR expression and function. This might predict that an efficient control of inflammation improves CFTR functioning. Considering that IDO1 is a potent driver of autophagy, and that restoring disabled autophagy in CF will rescue CFTR function, we interrogated whether Tα1 treatment would also affect CFTR functioning. We found that Tα1 favored trafficking of mature CFTR in CFBE41o- cells stably expressing p.Phe508del-CFTR. CFTR exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, passage through the Golgi, and delivery of the mature form (band C) to the cell surface are accompanied by an increase in molecular weight (from 135–140 to 170–180 kDa), as a result of glycosylation. At a clinically attainable dose , Tα1 increased cellular expression of mature p.Phe508del-CFTR (Fig. 2a; band C) by 10 ± 0.5 fold relative to vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2b), reaching levels as high as 52 ± 7% of control values. The effect was observed at 30 min and up to 24 h (Fig. 2a), was dose-dependent (Fig. 2c), and still somewhat detectable at 24 h after Tα1 removal (Fig. 2d).\n\nLow-temperature treatment of p.Phe508del airway cells alleviates the processing defect of the mutant protein, enhancing its PM localization. Tα1 increased PM localization of p.Phe508del-CFTR to the half-maximal value afforded",

Tα1 increased PM localization of p.Phe508del-CFTR to the half-maximal value afforded by low-temperature incubation (Fig. 2e,f), as revealed by immunoblotting of purified PM fractions (FLOT-1+) with anti-CFTR antibody (Fig. 2g,h) and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2i). We found clear restriction of p.Phe508del proteins around the nucleus in untreated CFBE41o- cells, as opposed to the mutated protein’s migration to the PM after Tα1 treatment. This suggested that Tα1 increases the conformational stability of p.Phe508del-CFTR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus allowing its exit from ER and trafficking to the cell surface. This was confirmed by the limited proteolysis assay, which measures resistance to proteolytic digestion of folded vs. unfolded proteins. Tα1 reduced the proteolytic digestion of p.Phe508del-CFTR (Fig. 2j).\n\nAs Rab GTPases modulate the intracellular trafficking of CFTR through the endosomal and recycling compartments, we performed immunostaining of p.Phe508del-CFTR with markers of early (Rab5), late (Rab7), and recycling (Rab9) endosomes after Tα1 exposure. Tα1 reduced co-localization of mutant CFTR with Rab5 and Rab7, and it instead promoted co-localization with Rab9 (Fig. 2k), indicating that Tα1 reduces endocytic recycling through the early endosomes, prevents movement to the late endosomes and/or lysosomes, and favors recycling from endosomes to the PM. Thus Tα1 facilitates proper folding and trafficking of p.Phe508del-CFTR and also stabilizes the rescued CFTR mutant protein at the PM.\n\nTα1 rescues CFTR protein through USP36-deubiquitination and autophagy\n\nNext we measured the half-life of p.Phe508del-CFTR in CFBE41o- cells treated with Tα1 for 24 h at 37 °C. Tα1 did not increase steady-state CFTR mRNA expression (data not shown) and marginally affected the half-life of WT-CFTR, but it significantly increased the half-life of p.Phe508del-CFTR, which was shorter (1 h) than that of WT-CFTR (4 h) (Fig. 3 a,b). The effect of Tα1 could not be traced to inhibition of the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways, as Tα1 did not inhibit degradation of reporter substrates (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). However, Tα1 was detected in immunoprecipitated p.Phe508del-CFTR from CFBE41o- cells overexpressing Tα1 or treated with Tα1 for 2 h at 37 °C. While present in bronchial epithelial cells expressing WT-CFTR, Tα1 was not detected in immunoprecipitated WT-CFTR (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Overexpression of Tα1 increased CFTR maturation (Supplementary Fig. 5c), IL10 expression and decreased IL6 expression (Supplementary Fig. 5d), suggesting functional Tα1 activity. Consistent with the ER localization of Tα1 that is different from that of its precursor prothymosin, these results indicated that Tα1 associates with p.Phe508del-CFTR, suggesting a chaperone activity of Tα1 that may affect the protein’s ER quality control and degradation. Indeed, Tα1 perturbed the physical interaction of p.Phe508del-CFTR with the ER chaperon Hsp70, but not Hsp90 or calnexin, which are known to assist protein folding or degradation (Supplementary Fig. 5e,f).\n\nPoorly-folded PM-bound CFTR is subjected to proteolysis by the ER-associated degradation mechanism via the cytosolic ubiquitin (Ub)-26S proteasome system. Ubiquitination was reduced in immunoprecipitated p.Phe508del-CFTR from CFBE41o- cells treated with Tα1 (Fig. 3c). Most of the ubiquitinated p.Phe508del-CFTR was ∼200 kDa in molecular weight. Because CFTR detected by western blot was an ∼180 kDa complex and a single ubiquitin has a molecular mass of 8 kDa, it appears that Tα1 reduced multi-ubiquitination, a signal that targets proteins in early endosomes for lysosomal degradation.\n\nThe removal of ubiquitin by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) regulates sorting of ubiquitinated PM-associated proteins. Using a hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin probe engineered to form an irreversible, covalent bond with active DUBs, we identified the ubiquitin-specific protease 36 (USP36)—which inhibits autophagy of protein aggregates by deubiquitination—as a regulator of deubiquitination events triggered by Tα1. USP36—and neither of the two major p.Phe508del-CFTR DUBs, USP10 and USP19—could be detected in Tα1-treated cells (Fig. 3d). Paralleling the promotion of mature CFTR (Fig. 2), the",

USP36—and neither of the two major p.Phe508del-CFTR DUBs, USP10 and USP19—could be detected in Tα1-treated cells (Fig. 3d). Paralleling the promotion of mature CFTR (Fig. 2), the induction of USP36 occurred at 30 min and was still present at 24 h of exposure (Fig. 3e). USP36 associated with immunoprecipitated p.Phe508del-CFTR (Fig. 3f) and deubiquitinated CFTR in Rab5+ and more so Rab9+ endosomes in Tα1-treated cells (Fig. 3g). This is in line with the finding that Rab9 enters the endosomal pathway at the transition stage between early Rab5+ and late Rab7+ endosomes and co-localizes to the trans-Golgi network. The depletion of USP36 by RNA interference abrogated the rescuing effect of Tα1 on mature p.Phe508del-CFTR, while its over-expression further increased the capacity of Tα1 to rescue mutated CFTR (Fig. 3h). Thus the corrector activity of Tα1 correlated with USP36-mediated deubiquitination of CFTR in endosomes, thereby promoting its trafficking to the post-endocytic compartment and a more efficient ER export to the cell surface. USP36 was not involved in the promotion of IDO1 activity by Tα1 (Fig. 3i), a finding consistent with the importance of the proteasomal degradation pathway for IDO1 activity, and likewise arguing for USP36 selectivity in CFTR correction.\n\nThe ubiquitin system is deeply influenced by autophagy. Defective autophagy in CF leads to an increased pool of ubiquitinated proteins, including the ubiquitin-binding protein SQSTM1/p62, which is pivotal in the aggresome sequestration of ubiquitinated p.Phe508del-CFTR as well as in the p.Phe508del-CFTR disposal from PM after rescue. Indeed, the enforced expression of SQSTM1/p62 lacking the UBA domain stabilizes p.Phe508del-CFTR at the PM and promotes its recycling. Consistent with the ability of autophagy to rescue CFTR function, Tα1 was able to promote IDO1-dependent autophagy (Supplementary Fig. 6a-d), to reduce SQSTM1/p62 levels (Supplementary Fig. 6e) and, importantly, to correct CFTR in an autophagy-dependent manner, as indicated by the decreased rescuing activity in mice bearing CftrF508del in a Becn1+/– haploinsufficient background, which confers a major autophagy defect (Supplementary Fig. 6f).\n\nTα1 increases p.Phe508del-CFTR and CLCA1 function\n\nThe corrector and stabilizing capacity of Tα1 would anticipate an increased chloride-ion channel function of the rescued p.Phe508del-CFTR. We treated p.Phe508del-CFTR-transfected CFBE41o- cells with Tα1 for 2 or 24 h at 37 °C before determining the channel open probability (Po) of p.Phe508del-CFTR. Studies have estimated that the extent of correction in p.Phe508del airway epithelial cells must approximate 20–30% of WT CFTR function to provide therapeutic benefit. Treatment with Tα1 for 2 h restored channel gating of rescued p.Phe508del-CFTR (Fig. 4a), with a 4-fold increase in Po, namely, from 0.08 ± 0.02 of untreated CFTR to 0.35 ± 0.07 after treatment (Fig. 4b), with the latter Po values being similar to those in WT-CFTR. A 2-fold increase in chloride-current density was still observed at 24 h, as assessed by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of p.Phe508del-CFTR cells (Fig. 4c,d), and the rate of iodide efflux would then approximate 70% of the control value in WT cells, as assessed by the halide-sensitive fluorescent probe 6-methoxy-N-(sulphopropyl)quinolinium after stimulation with forskolin (Fig. 4e). This was confirmed by the results obtained in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells from a subject with two distinct—G1244E and p.Phe508del —mutations, whereby a gating defect occurred in association with the p.Phe508del defect. The effect of Tα1 was qualitatively similar, although of lesser extent, to that obtained with the potentiator ivacaftor (Fig. 4f), known to restore channel activity in CFTR gating (class III) mutations, including the G1244E mutation. This in agreement with recent evidence indicating that proteostasis regulators rescue functional CFTR expression in human and mouse cells bearing only one copy of p.Phe508del.\n\nBypassing CFTR by targeting additional ion channels is an alternative strategy to circumvent the CFTR defect. Based on data gathered from DNA microarray analysis in vivo of Tα1-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b), we assessed whether Tα1 would increase mRNA expression of the calcium-activated chloride channel regulator (CLCA)1, a member of the CLCA protein family capable of paracrine modulation of the activity of TMEM16A, an alternative chloride channel that could obviate the primary defect in CF.

Tα1 potentiated calcium-activated chloride currents (Fig. 4g,h) and persistently increased the expression of CLCA1 (Fig. 4i) in CFBE41o- cells. Depleting CLCA1 with specific siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 7) greatly reduced the ion-channel activity promoted by Tα1 (Fig. 4e). These findings suggested that Tα1 is endowed with effects that can further ameliorate chloride-channel activity in CF.\n\nTα1 rescues p.Phe508del-CFTR in mice and HBE cells\n\nTo determine whether Tα1 corrects CFTR in vivo, we assessed CFTR expression and activity in 4-wk-old CftrF508del C57BL/6 mice treated daily for 6 days with 200 μg/kg Tα1. Tα1 restored CFTR expression in the lung (Fig. 5a,b) and small intestine (Fig. 5c,d), as assessed by immunoblotting of cell lysates (Fig. 5a,c), and it promoted localization of mature CFTR at the PM (Fig. 5b,d), as revealed by immunohistochemistry. Functionally, Tα1 treatment restored channel gating in lung epithelial cells with a 2-fold increase in Po from 0.23 ± 0.02 to 0.45 ± 0.04, before and after forskolin and genistein stimulation (Fig. 5e,f). In intestines from CftrF508del mice mounted in Ussing chambers—much like the proteostasis regulator cysteamine—Tα1 significantly increased CFTR-dependent Cl− conductance in response to forskolin (Fig. 5g). Rescuing of CFTR activity by Tα1 was also observed in CftrF508del mice on an FVB/129 background (data not shown). Of interest, Tα1 also increased CLCA1 expression in both lung (Fig. 5h,i) and gut (Fig. 5j,k). Taken together, these data indicated that administration of Tα1 ameliorated Cl− fluxes in the intestinal and respiratory tracts of CftrF508del mice.\n\nTo test the activity of Tα1 in a more relevant clinical setting, HBE cells from 5 subjects, homozygous for the p.Phe508del-CFTR mutation, were assessed for CFTR, USP36 protein levels and CLCA1 gene expressions after exposure to Tα1 for 24 h at 37 °C. Tα1 increased the expression of the mature p.Phe508del-CFTR (Fig. 6a), USP36 (Fig. 6b) and CLCA1 (Fig. 6c) in 3 out of 5 subjects with CF and concomitantly increased ion-channel activity (Fig. 6d). To assess the clinical relevance of these findings, we measured the concentrations of Tα1 in sputa from subjects with the p.Phe508del-CFTR mutation and control subjects, considering that Tα1 is highly expressed not only in human thymic epithelium but also in peripheral tissues. We found lower concentrations of Tα1 in subjects with CF than controls (Fig. 6e), which is consistent with the lower levels observed in supernatants and lysates from p.Phe508del-CFTR-transfected CFBE41o- cells relative to WT-CFTR–transfected cells (Fig. 6f). Because signaling via TLRs influences Tα1 production by lung epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 8), the deregulated TLR activity observed in subjects with CF may impact on local Tα1 production and, ultimately, CFTR activity. This likely occurs, as endogenous Tα1 affected CFTR functional expression. Indeed, we assessed mature CFTR expression in HBE cells from subjects with the p.Phe508del-CFTR mutation and controls after prothymosin depletion (by specific siRNA) or overexpression (via transfection), because Tα1 is produced by cleavage of prothymosin by the lysosomal asparaginyl endopeptidase legumain. We found that mature p.Phe508del-CFTR expression was negated by prothymosin inhibition and increased by prothymosin overexpression (Fig. 6g). Of interest, prothymosin overexpression also increased mature CFTR expression in cells from controls (Fig. 6g), which points to a role for the endogenous prothymosin/Tα1 system in CFTR physiology.\n\nWe finally comparatively assessed the ion-channel activity of Tα1 with that of lumacaftor or ivacaftor, either alone or in combination, in primary HBE cells from controls or subjects homozygous for the p.Phe508del-CFTR mutation. Ussing chamber tracings revealed that Tα1 promoted the forskolin-induced increase in the chloride current (Isc) in HBE cells from subjects with CF (Fig. 6h) but not controls (Fig. 6i), an effect that was sensitive to CFTR inhibition and was similar to that observed with lumacaftor.

There were statistically significant differences in sex, age, BMI, SBP, and DBP readings between those individuals taking and not taking antihypertensive medications.\n\nVariable selection for inclusion in BP models\n\nIn our sample, age, sex, and BMI were associated with SBP (S1 Table). Unfair treatment variables were not associated with BP in simple linear regression analysis. Based on these results, as well as potential confounders previously identified in the literature and inclusion of our new measures of unfair treatment, we included the following variables in our models of adjusted BP: age, sex, BMI, education, African ancestry, unfair treatment and PC-AiRs.\n\nStrategy for genetic analyses\n\nWe analyzed SBP and DBP measurements separately since the underlying genetic susceptibility of hypertension may be different for elevated SBP and DBP. Three main genetic analyses were performed (Fig 1). We first performed standard admixture mapping using a frequentist approach by linearly regressing blood pressure on local ancestry, adjusted for global ancestry, sex, age, education, BMI and relatedness (Fig 1A). We next performed standard genetic association analysis for blood pressure using a frequentist approach by linearly regressing blood pressure on SNP genotype, adjusted for global ancestry, sex, age, education, BMI, and relatedness (Fig 1B). Finally, we used joint admixture and association mapping with partial Bonferroni correction to identify SNPs that were associated with BP using a Bayesian approach where we set the posterior probabilities from admixture mapping as the prior probabilities for association mapping. Three progressive joint admixture and association models were performed. Model 1 tested SNP genotype (Fig 1C), Model 2 added measures of unfair treatment (Fig 1D), and Model 3 tested for an interaction term between SNP genotype and unfair treatment (Fig 1E).\n\nAdmixture mapping for blood pressure\n\nAdmixture mapping (illustrated in Fig 1A) did not detect any genome-wide significant loci associated with BP after correcting for the average number of admixture switches (p-value less than or equal to 0.05/78.82 = 6.34x10-4) (S1A and S1B Fig).\n\nAssociation mapping for blood pressure\n\nAssociation mapping (illustrated in Fig 1B) did not detect any significant SNPs associated with BP after Bonferroni correction (p-value less than or equal to 1/27,559 = 3.6 x 10−5) (S1C and S1D Fig).\n\nJoint admixture and association mapping for BP\n\nThree progressive joint admixture and association models were performed using a Bayesian approach (illustrated in Fig 1C–1E); Model 1 tested SNP genotype, Model 2 added measures of unfair treatment, and Model 3 tested for an interaction term between SNP genotype and unfair treatment. We performed simulation analyses to assess the statistical significance of our associations. We randomly re-shuffled the associated BP measures and covariates to the SNP genotypes and ancestry estimates in our participants 10,000 times and created a distribution of p-values. This distribution was used to obtain the false positive rate of our associations. We only report significant SNPs that were confirmed through simulations analyses.\n\nModel 1 joint admixture and association mapping detected eight significant SNPs for SBP (Fig 2A, Table 2 & S2 Table). Among the significant SNPs identified, SNP rs56766116 is located in the LRP8 gene, SNPs rs6739240 and rs72783028 are located in the CAPN13 gene, SNPs rs6791604 and rs2320172 are located in the MITF gene, SNP rs2116737 is located in the SGCD gene, and SNPs rs80149157 and rs67579183 are located in the MLL3 gene. We detected three significant associations when testing DBP and all three SNPs (rs77804878, rs114805596, rs17173425) are located in the MLL3 gene (Fig 2B, Table 3 & S3 Table).\n\nModel 2 builds on Model 1 by including one of two measures of unfair treatment [unfair treatment of self (UT-Self) and unfair treatment of others (UT-Other)]. When testing SBP, we detected one significant association when including UT-Self (rs2116737 is located in the SCGD gene) (Fig 2C, Table 2 & S2 Table) and two significant associations when including UT-Other (rs115805528 in the MITF gene and rs7962445 in the PRH1-PRR4 gene) (Fig 2E, Table 2 & S2 Table). When testing DBP, we detected eight significant associations when including UT-Self (rs2597955, rs2600370, rs2600368, rs2708349, rs2600362, rs2597921, rs2416545 located in PRH1-PRR4 and rs2445762 located in CYP19A1 gene) (Fig 2D, Table 3 & S3 Table) and one significant associations when including UT-Other (rs1319603 downstream of KCNK2/KCTD3 genes) (Fig 2F, Table 3 & S3 Table).\n\nModel 3 builds on the previous models by testing for interactions between SNP genotype and unfair treatment associated with BP.

    "content": "Results\n\nSNPs in four independent genomic regions associate with plasma kynurenine\n\nOf all SNPs reaching genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10−8), we identified six lead SNPs associated with plasma kynurenine in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) and TwinsUK GWAS meta-analysis at (Table 1). Based on Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genomic location, we concluded that these 6 lead SNPs represent 4 independent loci. Three SNPs are cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for genes involved in tryptophan/kynurenine metabolism: the IDO 1/2 genes (rs10085935, Chr8), which are the rate limiting enzymes in the kynurenine extrahepatic pathway; and SLC7A5 (rs750950 and rs8051149, Chr16), which participates in tryptophan transport across the cell membrane. Two SNPs mapped to a region on Chr 12. The strongest association was with rs3184504, a missense variant in a known inflammatory gene, SH2B3, and has been associated with multiple phenotypes including myocardial infarction and hypertension. The final SNP (rs16924894, Chr10) is an intergenic variant located near the KIAA1217 and ARHGAP21 genes. Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, encoded by the TDO2 gene, is another key regulatory enzyme in the kynurenine pathway. We assessed the SNPs located in or near the TDO2 genes and none were significantly associated with plasma kynurenine levels. Of 6 downstream metabolites (3-hydroxy anthranilic acid (3HAA), and quinolinic acid (QA), NAM (nicotinamide), NA (nicotinic acid), KA (kynurenic acid), HK (hydroxykynurenine)) in the kynurenine pathway, GWAS data of QA and NAM levels showed no significant associations with the SH2B3 rs3184504 variant. (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nSH2B3 and rs3184504 associate with plasma kynurenine\n\nTo confirm the SH2B3 rs3184504 SNP association with kynurenine levels, we examined the genetic association with plasma kynurenine using data from the ABO Glycoproteomics in Platelets and Endothelial Cells (ABO) Study (N = 66 young healthy volunteers). The pattern of association was consistent with a recessive effect (Fig. 1), with a significant association between homozygosity for the T allele and increased kynurenine (β = 0.17, p = 0.04, recessive genetic model).\n\nWe further characterized regulation of kynurenine by SH2B3 by measuring kynurenine levels in an Sh2b3−/− mouse, as compared to wild-type controls. The most marked differences in kynurenine levels were observed in white adipose tissue where there were more than 2.5-fold (p = 0.009) higher kynurenine levels in Sh2b3−/− compared to wild type mice (Fig. 2). In contrast, significantly lower levels of kynurenine were observed in plasma (≈ 0.25-fold, p = 0.02) and brain (≈ 0.13-fold, p = 0.02) of Sh2b3−/− mice. There was no difference in kynurenine levels in the spleen and modestly lower, but non-significant, levels in the liver in KO mice compared to controls. (Supplementary Fig. 1). These data suggest that SH2B3 is a regulator of kynurenine metabolism, but that the effects on the pathway may differ by tissue.\n\nPlasma Kynurenine and inflammation\n\nInflammation is a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. To understand a possible genetic relationship between kynurenine and CRP, an inflammatory biomarker associated with cardiometabolic disease risk, we conducted bi-directional Mendelian randomization analyses. Genetically determined kynurenine levels were associated with increased CRP (inverse-variance weighted average meta-analysis [IVWA] β = 0.21 (0.10), p = 0.04), but the reverse association was not significant (p = 0.71), suggesting that kynurenine may increase CRP levels. We also examined the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge (an acute inflammatory stimulus) on kynurenine levels in healthy human subjects (N = 24). In the Genetics of Evoked responses to Niacin and Endotoxemia (GENE) study, plasma kynurenine significantly increased by 25% (p = 0.0008) 2 h post-LPS challenge (Fig. 3), confirming that an inflammatory stimulus causes rapid increases in plasma kynurenine levels. This timepoint is concurrent with peak cytokine responses to LPS (e.g. TNFα, IL-6), but precedes an increase in CRP, which peaked 24 h post-LPS, highlighting kynurenine as an early marker of acute inflammation.\n\nKynurenine and body composition\n\nObesity is an inflammatory state, and is associated with elevated CRP levels. We tested whether genetically determined central adiposity, measured by waist circumference is associated with kynurenine levels, and found a significant positive association (IVWA β = 0.04 (0.01), p = 0.0002). Similarly, in the ABO Study, measured waist circumference was positively correlated with plasma kynurenine levels (r = 0.279, p = 0",

Similarly, in the ABO Study, measured waist circumference was positively correlated with plasma kynurenine levels (r = 0.279, p = 0.02). Collectively, these results suggest that central adiposity is associated with higher kynurenine levels.\n\nThe kynurenine association with cardiometabolic diseases risk is specific to the SH2B3 pathway\n\nThe individual SNPs associated with plasma kynurenine represent distinct mechanisms of kynurenine regulation and may have distinct patterns of disease associations. We conducted PheWAS for each of the six SNPs individually. The SNPs near the IDO1/2 and SLC7A5 genes, which directly contribute to either kynurenine synthesis or metabolism, had no significant associations with disease. In contrast, 30 phenotypes significantly associated with rs3184504 in SH2B3 at FDR q < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 2). Among these associations were three distinct collections of diagnoses related to: hypothyroidism, hypertension and heart diseases including myocardial infarction, all of which were associated with higher kynurenine levels. The associations were similar in the Electronic Medical Records and Genetics (eMERGE)/BioVU (Fig. 4) and the UK Biobank data sets (Supplementary Fig. 2). In sum, the SH2B3 rs3184504 variant associates with a range of diseases, and that previously reported epidemiological disease associations with plasma kynurenine may be driven by genetic mechanisms associated with SH2B3.\n\nWe performed phenome-wide association testing between the 6-SNP kynurenine polygenic risk score and 894 phenotypes in the BioVU and eMERGE datasets to explore whether genetically-predicted plasma kynurenine associated with clinical disease risk. We did not identify any significant associations (FDR q < 0.05). (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, plasma kynurenine is likely not a causal mediator of cardiometabolic diseases.\n\nThe SH2B3 rs3184504 variant may modulate disease though modulation of metabolic rate\n\nWe hypothesized that the mechanism linking SH2B3 to disease may be through effects on energy metabolism. In the ABO study the rs3184504 risk variant was associated with significantly lower heart rate (β = −4.98, p = 0.0004, additive genetic model and β = −4.98, p = 0.017, recessive genetic model) and body temperature (β = −0.002, p = 0.0007, additive genetic model and β = −0.003, p = 0.004, recessive genetic model), suggestive of physiological differences. In the UK biobank (UKBB), we observed significant inverse relationship between the rs3184504 variant and whole body fat-free mass (β = −0.91, FDR p = 1.39E−23), and basal metabolic rate (β = −0.91, FDR p = 3.38E−21). However, this variant was not associated with body fat percentage (β = −0.05, FDR p = 0.89), suggesting a relationship with mitochondrial energy metabolism rather than a direct effect on adiposity.\n\nFigure 5 summarizes the findings of the current study.",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nThe characteristics of case and control infants and mothers are summarized in Table I. Case infants were more likely to be female than were control infants. Compared to non-Hispanic White mothers, Hispanic mothers were younger at delivery (mean age 27.0 vs. 31.8); however, maternal age at delivery was consistent across cases and controls within maternal race/ethnicity. Case mothers had fewer years of formal education than control mothers, as did Hispanic mothers compared to non-Hispanic White mothers. Maternal periconceptional use of folic acid supplements was higher in non-Hispanic Whites than in Hispanic mothers; differences in daily dietary intake of folate and the composite folate intake variable across these subgroups were more subtle.\n\nInformation for each SNP, (chromosome, rs ID, polymorphism type, general genic location, minor allele, genotyping failure rates, genotype distribution and results of testing for HWE in control mothers and infants) is summarized in Supplementary eTable I (See Supporting Information online).\n\nResults from logistic regression models are summarized in Table II. There was no evidence of a nonrandom association (for main or interaction effects) between NTD-affected pregnancies and either maternal or infant variants in DHFR.\n\nMTHFD1\n\nAn approximate 1.5-fold increase in risk was observed in infant MTHFD1 SNPs rs2236224 and rs2236225 for infants with the CT genotype in the lowest folate intake category compared to those with the CC genotype in the higher intake group (OR[int CC vs. CT] = 1.58, 80% CI: 0.99, 2.51 (LRT P = 0.07); OR[int CC vs. CT] = 1.53, 80% CI: 0.95, 2.47 (LRT P = 0.10), respectively; Table II). The infant AG genotype in MTHFD1 SNP rs11627387 appeared to be associated with a four-fold increase in NTD risk when there was low maternal folate intake compared to infants with the GG genotype and high maternal folate intake (OR[int GG vs. AG] = 4.25, 80% CI: 2.33, 7.75 (LRT P < 0.05)).\n\nMTHFR\n\nMothers had a decreased risk of an NTD-affected pregnancy with low intake of folates and MTHFR SNPs rs1476413, rs1801131 and rs1801133 in heterozygous compared to common homozygous mothers in the high folate intake group (OR[int GG vs. AG] = 0.55, 80% CI: 0.20, 1.48 (LRT P = 0.15); OR[int AA vs. AC] = 0.58, 80% CI: 0.24, 1.43 (LRT P = 0.08); OR[int CC vs. CT] = 0.69, 80% CI: 0.41, 1.17 (LRT P = 0.03), respectively).\n\nSHMT1\n\nA maternal gene-only effect for SHMT1 SNP rs669340 CG appeared to be associated with a reduced risk of an NTD-affected pregnancy compared to mothers with the CC genotype (OR[CC vs. CG]= 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.96; (LRT P = 0.03), Table II). An interaction effect was observed for risk of NTDs in infants with the SHMT1 SNP rs12939757 AG genotype that were in the low folate intake group compared to infants with the AA genotype that were in the high folate intake group (OR[int AA vs. AG] = 2.01; 80% CI: 1.20, 3.37 (LRT P = 0.10)).\n\nTYMS\n\nThe gene-folate interaction was associated with a reduced risk of NTDs for mothers in the low folate intake group with TYMS SNP rs502396 or rs699517 heterozygous genotype compared to the high folate intake group with the common homozygous genotype (OR[int TT vs. CT] = 0.91, 80% CI: 0.53, 1.56 (LRT P = 0.12); OR[int CC vs. CT] = 0.70, 80% CI: 0.38, 1.29 (LRT P = 0.19), Table II). The interaction effect in infants was also protective for risk for SNP rs2847153 (OR[int GG vs. AG] = 0.73, 80% CI: 0.37, 1.45 (LRT P = 0.14)).",

    "content": "Results\n\nThe phenotypic characteristics of the two Danish cohorts, Inter99 and Health2006, are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Individuals were middle-aged, with a median BMI of 25.6 and 25.2 kg/m2, respectively. Serum vitamin B12 levels were higher in Health2006 compared to Inter99, but similar among women and men within cohorts (Supplemental Table 1).\n\nObservational association between serum vitamin B12 levels and BMI\n\nDecreasing levels of serum vitamin B12 were associated with increasing BMI in the two Danish cohorts (Fig. 1). A BMI difference of 0.48 (95% CI 0.19; 0.76) kg/m2 and 0.64 (95% CI 0.26; 1.02) kg/m2 was observed when comparing the first and third tertile of serum vitamin B12 levels in Inter99 and Health2006, respectively. Accordingly, a 20% decrease in serum vitamin B12 levels was associated with an increase in BMI of 0.10 (95% CI 0.05; 0.14) kg/m2 (P = 1 × 10−4) in Inter99 and 0.19 (95% CI 0.10; 0.27) kg/m2 (P = 3 × 10−5) in Health2006. Linear regression model additionally adjusted for lifestyle factors (diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and smoking), as well as exclusion of type 2 diabetes patients receiving anti-diabetic treatment (nInter99 = 71, nHealth2006 = 66) showed similar results (Supplemental Table 2). \n\nIn addition to BMI, decreasing levels of serum vitamin B12 were associated with increasing waist circumference and body fat percentage. A 20% decrease in serum vitamin B12 levels was associated with an increase in waist circumference of 0.23 (95% CI 0.11; 0.35) cm (P = 3 × 10−4) in Inter99 and 0.46 (95% CI 0.24; 0.69) cm (P = 6 × 10−5) in Health2006. Body fat percentage was only measured in Health2006, where a 20% decrease in serum vitamin B12 levels was associated with an increase in body fat percentage of 0.29 (95% CI 0.16; 0.42)% (P = 1 × 10−5). Decreasing levels of serum vitamin B12 were also associated with increasing waist/hip ratio in Health2006 (P = 0.03) but not in inter99 (P = 0.14).\n\nGenotypes and serum vitamin B12 levels\n\nThe ten SNPs included in the full-B12 GRS each associated with decreased serum vitamin B12 levels in both Inter99 and Health2006 (Supplemental Table 3). The SNP showing the strongest association was FUT2 rs602662 with a per G-allele decrease in serum vitamin B12 of −10 (95% CI −11; −8)% (P = 3 × 10−37) according to an additive model in Inter99. However, the median serum vitamin B12 levels suggested that a dominant model would be more appropriate. Comparing homozygous/heterozygous G-allele carriers with homozygous A-allele carriers showed a serum vitamin B12 level decrease of −20 (95% CI −22; −17)% (P = 1 × 10−51). A similar association pattern was observed in Health2006 (Supplemental Table 3).\n\nThe full-B12 GRS associated strongly with serum vitamin B12 levels, with a per effect allele decrease of −7 (95% CI −8; −7)% (P = 5 × 10−104) in Inter99, and a similar association was observed in Health2006 (Supplemental Table 4). However, the overall aim of constructing a GRS was to obtain an instrument for serum vitamin B12 levels not influenced by potential confounders. FUT2 and FUT6 are known to determine ABH antigen secretor/nonsecretor status and be involved in the creation of Lewis antigens, respectively. Hence, both could have pleiotropic effects, and therefore, we also analyzed a GRS excluding FUT2 rs602662 and FUT6 778805 (B12 GRS). The B12 GRS was not associated with potential confounders including age, sex, diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and smoking (Table 1). The proportion of physically inactive individuals was seemingly different among the B12 GRS allele groups, however, the direction of effect was opposite in the two cohorts, which may suggest that this is a chance finding (type 1 error). The B12 GRS showed a per allele decrease in serum vitamin B12 of −7 (95% CI −8; −7)% (P = 2 × 10−72) in Inter99, and −6 (95% CI −7; −5)% (P = 2 × 10−43) in Health2006 (Fig. 2; Supplemental Table 4). The F-statistics for the models were 331 in Inter99 and 197 in Health2006. The B12 GRS explained 5.5 and 6.7% of the phenotypic variance in serum vitamin B12 in Inter99 and Health2006, respectively (Supplemental Table 4).  \n\nB12 GRS and BMI\n\nIf decreased levels of serum vitamin B12 cause increased BMI, the B12 GRS would,",

The B12 GRS explained 5.5 and 6.7% of the phenotypic variance in serum vitamin B12 in Inter99 and Health2006, respectively (Supplemental Table 4).  \n\nB12 GRS and BMI\n\nIf decreased levels of serum vitamin B12 cause increased BMI, the B12 GRS would, given its strong association with serum vitamin B12 levels, expectedly also associate with increased BMI. However, we observed no association between the B12 GRS and BMI in either Inter99 or Health2006. A fixed-effect model was used to combine the effect sizes from the two cohorts and resulted in a per allele effect of 0.00 (95% CI −0.07; 0.06) kg/m2 (P = 0.91) (Table 2). Accordingly, when analyzed separately, none of the eight SNPs included in the B12 GRS associated with BMI in the two cohorts (data not shown). \n\nObservational versus genetic associations\n\nTo directly compare the observational effect of decreased serum vitamin B12 levels on BMI with the effect of genetically induced low serum vitamin B12 levels on BMI, we performed an instrumental variable analysis. The combined observational effect of a 20% decrease in serum vitamin B12 on BMI in the two cohorts was an increase of 0.09 (95% CI 0.05; 0.13) kg/m2, (P = 3 × 10−5), whereas a genetically induced 20% decrease in serum vitamin B12 had no effect on BMI (−0.03 (95% CI −0.22; 0.16) kg/m2, P = 0.74). Since we observed an association between decreased serum vitamin B12 levels and BMI but no association between genetically induced decreased serum vitamin B12 levels and BMI, the present results do not support a causal role of serum vitamin B12 levels on BMI. However, as the observational estimate (0.09) is included in the 95% CI of the genetic estimate (−0.22; 0.16), we cannot completely rule out causality (Fig. 3). \n\nFUT2 genotype and BMI\n\nWe hypothesized that FUT2 rs602662, through yet undescribed pleiotropic effects, could explain a portion of the observational effect between serum vitamin B12 and BMI given the strong association with serum vitamin B12 (Supplemental Table 3). The serum vitamin B12 decreasing FUT2 rs602662 G-allele associated with increased BMI when combining Inter99 and Health2006 in a fixed-effects meta-analysis (0.15 (95% CI 0.01; 0.32) kg/m2, P = 0.03), and the FUT2 genotype explained 0.05 and 0.02% of the phenotypic variance in BMI in Inter99 and Health2006, respectively.\n\nValidation analyses in two German cohorts\n\nIndividuals in the German cohorts were middle-aged with slightly higher BMI than in Inter99 and Health2006 with a median BMI of 26.8 and 27.5 kg/m2 for SHIP-0 and SHIP-TREND, respectively (Supplemental Table 5). Serum vitamin B12 levels were not significantly associated with BMI (data not shown), but the serum vitamin B12 decreasing FUT2 rs602662 G-allele associated with increased BMI when combining SHIP-0 and SHIP-TREND in a fixed-effects meta-analysis [0.27 (95% CI 0.09; 0.44) kg/m2, P = 0.003]. The FUT2 rs602662 genotype explained 0.12% of the phenotypic variance of BMI in both SHIP-0 and SHIP-TREND. When combining the Danish and the German cohorts, the FUT2 rs602662 showed a combined per G-allele effect of 0.19 (95% CI 0.08; 0.30) kg/m2, P = 4 × 10−4 on BMI (Fig. 4). This association was supported by the European BMI data from the GIANT consortium where the FUT2 rs602662 G-allele (n = 233,871) associated nominally with increased BMI (P = 0.01). \n\nSensitivity analyses\n\nResults from instrumental variable analysis where each of the eight SNPs were used as separate instruments (equivalent to a GRS weighted based on the SNP-serum vitamin B12 association) were similar to results from instrumental variable analysis based on the simple allele-counting B12 GRS (Supplemental Table 6; Fig. 3). Causal estimates from MR-Egger regression were largely similar to two-stage least-squares regression estimates although the estimates from MR-Egger regression were underpowered (Supplemental Table 5; Supplemental Fig. 1). This was the case both when including and excluding FUT2 rs602662 and FUT6 rs778805. The intercept from MR-Egger regression did not differ from zero, neither when excluding FUT2 rs602662 and FUT6 rs778805, nor when including these two SNPs (Supplemental Table 6) suggesting that directional pleiotropy was not present. In support, Funnel plots were also largely symmetrical (Supplemental Fig. 1). No interaction was observed between the B12 GRS and BMI associated SNPs (Supplemental Table 7).",

In the multivariate linear regression analysis, sex, BMI, HTN, and eGFR (but not age and T2D) were significantly associated with uric acid levels (Table 2). The distribution of p-values for genetic association with serum uric acid is illustrated in Figure 1. The genomic control inflation factor was 0.9964, indicating no inflation of the type I error rate due to population stratification (Additional File 1). The top 25 ranked SNPs unadjusted for covariates are provided in Additional File 2 the 25 top ranked SNPs adjusted for age and sex are provided in Additional File 3 while the top 25 ranked SNPs adjusting for all covariates are provided in Additional File 4.\n\nThe four genome-wide significant associations were for SNPs rs3775948, rs7663032, rs6856396, and rs6449213 (Additional File 4). These 4 SNPs were among the eleven most frequently reported SNPs in SLC2A9 associated with serum uric acid in European-ancestry populations (Additional File 5). These four SNPs are all located in a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block on chromosome 4 (Figure 2) in the gene SLC2A9 (GeneID 56606). The next 8 highest ranking SNPs were also located in SLC2A9 (Additional File 4). The association at rs3775948 explained 2.6% of the phenotypic variance in our sample.\n\nSerum uric acid levels were significantly different between males and females (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 4.55 × 10-35), with males having a mean serum uric acid level of 6.25 mg/dl compared to 5.02 mg/dl for females. The effect size estimates between females and males at rs6449213 trended toward being significantly different (Welch's t-test, p = 0.068).

Restricting the r2 cutoff to ≥0.5, LD with rs6449213 in the CEU population remains unchanged while, in sharp contrast, the LD interval in YRI is reduced to approximately 37 kb. All of the 10 top ranking SNPs fall within the 263 kb range; on the other hand, and quite remarkably 9 of the 10 top ranked SNPs lie within the 37 kb interval and 3 out of the 4 SNPs that achieved genome-wide significance lie in an approximately 1.3 kb interval (Figure 3).",

Twenty-one individuals were excluded for low-quality DNA, insufficient quantities of DNA, or unwillingness to participate in this study (figure 1). Genetic screening was performed in 1179 patients. Of them, 1039 had complete clinical information. The mean age of onset was 35.21 years. Two hundred and twenty-seven (21.85%) were suspected to have primary aldosteronism (PA), 76 (7.31%) were suspected to pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), 18 (1.73%) were suspected to have Cushing syndrome, 4 (0.38%) were suspected to have Liddle syndrome, while the rest individuals had no suspected diagnosis (online supplementary table 2).\n\nThe mutational landscape of individuals\n\nAfter variants filtering, 598 variants harboured by 661 individuals were identified. Sanger sequencing was then performed to exclude false-positive variants. Five hundred and ninety-two variants harboured by 655 (55.56%) individuals were retained, whereas the remaining 524 patients (44.44%) had no variants (table 1). The most frequently mutated gene was CACNA1H (online supplementary figure 1). Sixty-two of the 592 variants were shared by ≥3 individuals (online supplementary table 3). Five of the 62 were identified from pedigrees and resulted in shared phenotypes. The remaining 57 variants were identified from unrelated individuals and two of them could lead to similar phenotypes (online supplementary table 4). No consanguineous marriage was observed.\n\nAccording to ACMG guidelines, 21 variants were found to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic (table 2), which may be responsible for monogenic forms of hypertension. Nine of the 21 were null variants that can be scored as pathogenic very strong and may lead to absence of gene products. The 21 variants were harboured by 33 individuals, and thus, the diagnostic yield of the current stage was 2.80%. None of the 33 individuals carried more than one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and all of these variants were absent from the control dataset. Five hundred and seventy variants were considered to be VUSs, whose clinical significance remained unknown. Of note, we identified 18 stop-gain variants and 13 frame-shift variants (online supplementary table 5). Among them, three stop-gain (ARMC5, CYP17A1 and SDHD) and three frame-shift variants (MEN1, SCNN1B and VHL) were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. LoF variants in all of the six genes are known mechanism of hypertension. Additionally, in four of the six genes (ARMC5,  SDHD, MEN1  and VHL ), stop-gain or frame-shift variants were proved to be targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.\n\nPhenotypes and genetic findings of individuals with multiple locus variants\n\nIn 655 individuals with positive findings, 131 (20%) harboured mutations in ≥2 genetic loci. We found three patients could be diagnosed with two disorders for harbouring variants from two distinct loci (online supplementary table 6). The first patient was a compound heterozygote of two CYP17A1 variants with 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency manifestations. She also carried a predicted deleterious heterozygous SCNN1B variant. After glucocorticoids and sex hormones treatment, her hypertension and hypokalemia were partly controlled. Amiloli experimental treatment was administered and her hypertension and hypokalemia were ideally controlled. The second patient carried a heterozygous variant of SCNN1G and a heterozygous variant of ARMC5 with Cushing syndrome manifestations. Unilateral adrenalectomy partly controlled his BP and cortisol level. Amiloli was further administered and his hypertension and hypokalemia were completely controlled. The third patient carried a heterozygous variant of CACNA1H and a heterozygous variant of WNK4 with pseudohypoaldosteronism, type IIB manifestations except for normal blood potassium. However, he had left adrenal nodules and aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) >30, indicating the existence of PA. The patients’ normal blood potassium may be due to the fact that pseudohypoaldosteronism, type IIB could lead to hyperkalemia, while PA could result in hypokalemia.\n\nGene product expression analyses of VUSs\n\nForty-seven VUSs in 17 causative genes were selected for gene product expression analyses (online supplementary figure 2). Although some variants were predicted to be LoF variants, expression analyses were still performed to confirm their roles in 293A cell lines. Equal transfection efficiencies between wild type and mutant groups were confirmed (online supplementary figure 2) and the mRNA levels between wild type and mutant genes showed no statistical difference in 16 genes. However, two stop gain variants in ARMC5 and VHL resulted in significantly reduced mRNA levels (online supplementary figure 3), which may be due to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Nineteen of the 47 VUSs resulted in reduced protein levels, while eight VUSs resulted in increased protein levels (figure 2, online supplementary figure 4). Therefore, 27 variants were regarded as potential functional VUSs (online supplementary table 8). The 27 potential functional VUSs were either located adjacent to mutation hotspots or located in well documented disease causing sites (online supplementary table 9) and the clinical phenotypes of the 49 patients were inconsistent with their genetic findings (online supplementary table 10).

However, seven of them carried one potential functional variant and at least one other VUS. Their phenotypes were all consistent with the clinical manifestations of the potential functional variants but not related with VUSs they harboured (online supplementary table 11).\n\nAssociations between clinical characteristics and genetic testing results\n\nWe totally identified 33 individuals with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, 49 individuals with potential functional variants, 572 individuals with VUSs, and one person with a benign variant (figure 3A, table 2). Diseases that harboured the greatest burden of pathogenic, likely pathogenic or potential functional variants were PA and PPGL (figure 3B). The BP of individuals with pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were clustered predominantly in the 150–170/95–105 mm Hg interval. Interestingly, individuals with potential functional variants were also distributed in the same interval, while individuals in the remaining three groups were distributed differently (figure 4A). The age of onset of individuals with pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were the youngest among all groups and mainly clustered in the 1–15 years’ interval. Moreover, patients with potential functional variants were slightly younger than individuals in the rest three groups (figure 4B).\n\nGenetic screening of family members\n\nFive pedigrees were observed in the current study (figure 5). Pedigree analyses uncovered a known pathogenic variant responsible for MEN2B (Family 1, RET c.T2753C), two novel pathogenic variants for pre-eclampsia (Families 2 and 3, CACNA1D c.A920G and c.G4370A p.R1457Q), a novel pathogenic variant for Liddle syndrome (Family 4, SCNN1B c.C1513T) and a known pathogenic variant for 17α-hydroxylase deficiency syndrome (Family 5, CYP17A1 c.985_987delinsAA). See online supplementary information for detailed information. CACNA1D variants have been well documented to be a causative gene responsible for PA. However, in family 2 and family 3, the probands and their affected relatives with CACNA1D mutations cannot be diagnosed as PA for failing to surpass the screening test ARR or confirmatory test. This suggest that CACNA1D variants identified in the current study may be responsible for pre-eclampsia rather than PA. These identifications expended the phenotypic profiles related with CACNA1D.",

Baseline Characteristics\n\nOf the 4054 participants in the association analysis, a total of 480 (11.8%) and 2468 (60.9%) participants developed type 2 diabetes and prediabetes during the 12-year follow-up period, respectively. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study population according to habitual coffee consumption. Compared with non-coffee consumers, participants who consumed either black coffee or sugared coffee were more likely to be younger, smoke, drink alcohol, and have a higher BMI.\n\n3.2. Genetic Polymorphisms Associated with Coffee Consumption\n\nIn the GWAS of habitual coffee consumption, a total of 18 SNPs located in 12q24 achieved a suggestive significance (p < 1 × 10−5) (Table S2). When we additionally adjusted for baseline BMI, the same 18 significant SNPs were identified as well (Table S3). SNPs identified based on habitual coffee consumption were the same when we additionally conducted a GWAS for continuous caffeine intake.\n\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 show the Manhattan plot and regional association plot, respectively. Figure 3 shows the Q-Q plot, and the genomic inflation factor (λ) of the GWAS was 1.0103, suggesting that the study population structure was well-adjusted. Among the SNPs achieved suggestive significance at p < 1 × 10−5, we selected SNPs as follows, which were used later for calculating the genetic risk scores. First, pairwise correlations were examined and high correlation was declared when r2 > 0.8 (Figure 4). Then, we excluded all imputed SNPs having a high correlation with any genotyped SNP, and selected the SNPs among highly-correlated genotyped SNPs. As a result, three genotyped SNPs (rs2074356, rs11066015, and rs12229654) and two imputed SNPs (rs11065828 and rs79105258) were considered as coffee-related SNPs and used for calculating the genetic risk scores. Table 2 presents the information on these five SNPs related to coffee consumption. The SNPs were located in genes HECTD4, ACAD10, MYL2, and CUX2, and the minor allele frequency ranged from 0.143 to 0.172 in our population.\n\n3.3. Coffee Consumption and the Risk of Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Combined\n\nWe examined the association between black coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined (Table 3). Compared with non-black-coffee consumers, participants who consumed ≥2 cups/day of black coffee had a 39% lower risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined among men and women combined (95% CI = 0.38–0.95; p for trend = 0.023). When we separated men and women, compared with non-black-coffee consumers, participants who consumed ≥2 cups/day of black coffee had a 54% lower risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined among men (95% CI = 0.23–0.94; p for trend = 0.026). Although the association was not statistically significant among women, an inverse trend was observed (OR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.41–1.34).\n\nTable 4 presents the association between sugared coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined. The ORs (95% CIs) of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined comparing sugared-coffee consumers with non-sugared-coffee consumers were 0.73 (0.60–0.89; p for trend = 0.005) for men and women combined, 0.71 (0.52–0.97; p for trend = 0.015) for men, and 0.75 (0.57–0.99; p for trend = 0.080) for women.\n\n3.4. Associations Modified by Genetic Risk Scores\n\nWe analyzed whether the association between habitual coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined varied by genetic polymorphisms. For black-coffee consumers, we found that an inverse association was more pronounced among individuals with high genetic risk scores, but the interaction was not statistically significant (p for interaction = 0.261) (Table 5). The ORs (95% CIs) for ≥2 cups/day of black coffee vs. non-black-coffee consumers were 0.87 (0.46–1.66) for participants with 0 points, 0.49 (0.17–1.44) for those with 0.1 to <5 points, and 0.36 (0.15–0.88) for those with 5 to 10 points for their genetic risk scores. For sugared coffee consumption, the associations with the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined were similar across genetic risk scores (p for interaction = 0.608) (Table 6). When we conducted an interaction analysis for each coffee-related SNP for black coffee consumption, the association between black coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined was inverse for the minor allele of each SNP (Table 7).",

Twenty-two participants have been removed because of the lack of blood test results in the enrollment or follow-up visit. All patients were treated for at least 12 months with GFD and vitamin D3 supplementation. There was no statistically significant difference in GFD duration between the anemic and non-anemic groups (mean, 29.9 and 30.0 months, respectively). Clinical characteristics and the rs855791 polymorphism status of CD patients with and without IDA at diagnosis are shown in Table 1.\n\nAt the time of diagnosis, sixty-six patients (62%) presented gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or constipation), and 22 (21%) had weight and/or height deficiency. In 17 cases (16%), CD co-occurred with type 1 diabetes. IDA was present at diagnosis in 25 patients (23.6%). Of those, ten patients had mild anemia, fifteen had moderate anemia, and three had severe anemia, according to WHO classification (Supplementary Table S1).\n\nThere was a tendency toward a higher proportion of the T allele in patients with IDA at diagnosis than in those without IDA (40% vs 34.6%, respectively), but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Table 1, Figure 1).\n\nHematological and biochemical parameters at diagnosis in patients stratified according to the rs855791 polymorphism status are presented in Table 2. No statistically significant differences in blood parameters at diagnosis were observed between the three rs855791 genotypes (i.e. homozygous TT, heterozygous CT, and homozygous CC), although there was a tendency toward lower HGB levels in the TT genotype and higher HGB levels in the CC genotype (median HGB = 11.95 g/dL, 12.60 g/dL, and 13.10 g/dL for homozygous TT, heterozygous CT, and homozygous CC, respectively). When each genotype group was further subdivided into children with or without anemia, significant differences between anemic and non-anemic children were observed in terms of blood parameters: HGB, hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), as expected, but no significant differences in those parameters were found between the genotypes. However, iron serum levels were significantly lower in anemic children with the CC genotype (median, 23 µg/dL) than in anemic children with the other two genotypes (median, 56 µg/dL for the TT genotype and 36 µg/dL for the CT genotype).\n\nHematological and biochemical parameters after 12 months of GFD in patients stratified according to the rs855791 polymorphism status are shown in Table 3. A significant reduction in TTG levels as compared to levels at diagnosis supported good dietary adherence in all subgroups. In general, twenty-two of the 25 patients (88%) who initially showed IDA had normalized their HGB levels after 12 months of GFD. In three children (12%), anemia persisted despite 12 months GFD, although its severity decreased. The rs855791genotypes of these three patients included: one patient with genotype TT and two with CT. Finally, two further children who did not have IDA at diagnosis developed anemia during 12 months of GFD (these cases were not considered as “persistent IDA” in the study).\n\nHematological parameters in all children with anemia at diagnosis significantly improved on GFD. In non-anemic children with a homozygous CC genotype, these parameters also increased after GFD, which was not the case for the other two genotypes.\n\nA correlation analyses between (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient test) at diagnosis (Figure 2) and after ≥12 months of GFD were performed to evaluate the association between the parameters (Figure 3). The rs855791 polymorphism status was not significantly correlated with any parameters when all patients were analyzed together (not shown). However, several correlations were observed when the anemic and non-anemic groups were analyzed separately (Figure 2 and Figure 3).\n\nAt diagnosis, in the anemic group (Figure 2A), a moderate negative correlation between the CT genotype and positive between TT and red cell distribution width (RDW) was observed (r = −0.48, p = 0.018), which was not seen in non-anemic children (Figure 2B). As expected, significant positive correlations were also observed between HGB, HCT, MCV, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and MCH (in particular in the anemic group), and between iron concentration, HGB and MCHC (in both groups). Conversely, a negative correlation between red blood cells (RBC), MCV, and MCH was observed in both groups.\n\nAfter 12 months of GFD (Figure 3A), in the anemic group, a correlation between the TT genotype and HCT was close to the significance threshold (r = −0.4, p = 0.06). A statistically significant negative correlation between hepcidin and MCV and MCH was also noted in this group (MCV: r = 0.53, p = 0.02; MCH: r = 0.61, p = 0.01). In the non-anemic group, no significant correlations between polymorphism status and other parameters (or between hepcidin levels and other parameters) were observed after 12-months of GFD (Figure 3B).

    "content": "Results\n\nSENP1-deficient mice exhibit T1DM phenotype\n\nTo investigate possible function of SENP1 in inflammation and diabetes, we created genetically modified mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of SENP1 with three different deleter lines carrying the Cre recombinase driven by the Adiponectin, PdgfRα or aP2/Fabp4 gene promoter (named as SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 1A). While the PdgfRα-Cre is predominantly expressed in bipotent progenitor adipocytes (white and beige adipocytes), the Adipoq-Cre has high efficiency and specificity in mature adipocytes. The aP2-Cre has a moderate efficiency in adipocytes with variable degrees of target gene recombination in macrophages or capillary endothelium in a floxed gene locus-dependent manner.\n\nSENP1 expression (messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein) was diminished in isolated adipocytes from interscapular brown adipose tissue, perigonadal white adipose tissue and peri-pancreatic adipose tissue (PAT) of SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO (with less efficiency in brown adipose tissue) and SENP1-aP2KO mice compared with the control SENP1lox/lox (Ctrl). In contrast, SENP1 expression was intact in isolated macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) and pancreatic islets from these mice (Supplementary Fig. 1B–C). Moreover, enhanced green fluorescent protein was detected in PATs but not in pancreatic islets when aP2-Cre deleter mice mating with mT/mG reporter mice (Supplementary Fig. 1D).\n\nSENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice were viable after birth. However, these adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice all developed a diabetic phenotype (Fig. 1a–c). An age-dependent increase in glucose levels was observed in SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice compared with the control SENP1lox/lox mice with an early onset of diabetes in SENP1-PdgfRKO at the age of 6 weeks (blood glucose level >225 mg dl−1); this earlier onset of hyperglycaemia is consistent with the high efficiency of PdgfRα-Cre in adipocyte progenitors. We observed similar phenotypic changes in both male (Fig. 1a–c) and female with or without fasting, and we focused on male mice for further studies. We measured glucose levels in SENP1-smKO and SENP1-ecKO mice, in which the SENP1 gene was specifically deleted in smooth muscle cells/pericytes by SM22α-Cre (SENP1-smKO) and in vascular endothelial cells by VE-cadherin-Cre (SENP1-ecKO), respectively. Unlike SENP1-aP2KO mice, SENP1-smKO and SENP1-ecKO mice did not develop a high-glucose phenotype even at the age of 14 weeks (Fig. 1d).\n\nInsulin levels in plasma were measured at various ages, and insulin secretion in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice was significantly declined after the ages of 8 and 10 weeks, respectively (Fig. 1e,f). Glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed at the age of 14 weeks to evaluate diabetes and insulin resistance. The level of hyperglycaemia observed with the GTT was prolonged in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice compared with Ctrl mice (Fig. 1g–j). However, similar insulin responses were observed between SENP1-deficient mice and Ctrl in the ITT assays (Fig. 1k,l for aP2KO mice). We then performed glucose-stimulated insulin assay with isolated islets. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from SENP1-deficient islets was significantly reduced (Fig. 1m). These data suggest that the high glucose level in SENP1-deficient mice was due to reduced insulin secretion.\n\nThe body weight and body mass are associated with the development of diabetes and increases in glucose levels. All SENP1-deficient mice had lower body weights compared with the control mice after onset of diabetes (Fig. 2a–d). However, adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice exhibited normal lipid profiles up to the age of 14 weeks, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA). Cholesterol and TG, but not HDL or FFA, were slightly reduced in SENP1-aP2KO mice after the age of 18 weeks (Fig. 2e–g). Water consumption and food-intake monitoring showed that SENP1-aP2KO mice had increased water consumption with similar dairy food uptake compared with Ctrl mice (Fig. 2h–i). Taken together, the assays described above suggest that type-1-like diabetic phenotypes developed in the adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice.\n\nSENP1 deficient mice show autoimmune mediated damages\n\nInsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus results from T-cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet β cells.

To determine the pathogenesis of diabetes in SENP1-deficient mice, we examined pancreatic development and pathology by haematoxylin and eosin stain and immunostaining for pancreatic β-cell number, mass and morphology changes, as well as immune cell invasion, indicative of insulitis. At early ages before the onset of hyperglycaemia, no significant differences were detected in pancreatic mass, β-cell number between the Ctrl and SENP1-deficient mice. However, the structures of pancreatic islets in SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice were drastically disrupted with increased TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL)-positive apoptosis of β cells after onset of diabetes and more severe at late stages (Fig. 3a–c for SENP1-aP2KO; Supplementary Fig. 2 for SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-PdgfRKO). There was a sharp decline in insulin staining and CD31+ vascular area in the islets in SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 3d with quantifications in Fig. 3e), indicating a loss of function in the β cell with disrupted vasculatures. These data provide direct evidence in support of apoptosis as the mechanism of β-cell death in SENP1-deficient mice.\n\nImmune cell-specific effector T-cell invasion in the pancreatic tissue attacks the islets and induces cell death. We observed an accumulation of white blood cells invasion into the islets in SENP1-deficient mice. In T1DM, β cell and islets are attacked by activated cytotoxic T cells. The section staining in the pancreases demonstrated that CD8+ T cells were absent from the islets of Ctrl mice. No pancreatic infiltrations of immune cells were detected in the SENP1-aP2KO mice under the age of 7 weeks. However, CD8+ T cells infiltrated into the islets of SENP1-aP2KO mice by the age of 12 weeks (Fig. 3f,g). Similar results were observed for CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A–B). These data strongly suggest a T-cell dominant mechanism for β-cell destruction.\n\nThe pre-diabetic phase of the disease usually begins several years before the clinical onset of the disease. During this phase, autoantibodies, mainly insulin autoantibody (IAA), are directed against β cells. IAA levels, along with other clinical information, aid in the diagnosis of T1DM. CRP and β-hydroxybutyrate are important clinical parameters for the diagnosis of diabetes. Individuals who develop diabetes typically have higher CRP levels. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is classified as ketones that are produced in the body when the body loses its ability to absorb glucose properly. SENP1-aP2KO mice had increased levels of IAA in the blood as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with an IAA-specific antibody. Greater levels of CRP and β-hydroxybutyrate were also observed in the blood of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 3h–j). All of the above data support the appearance of typical T1DM in SENP1-aP2KO mice.\n\nWe then fully characterized the immune system in the SENP1-deficient mice. We transplanted skin from mice (BALB/C) to Ctrl SENP1lox/lox and SENP1-aP2KO mice (C57BL/6 background). Severe skin-rejection response appeared in both Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice at an equal level, indicating SENP1-aP2KO mice are not immunodeficient (Supplementary Fig. 3C). We examined the immune cell populations in pancreas, pancreatic lymph nodes and spleen of SENP1-deficient mice. The distribution of immune cells in the pancreases was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses with specific surface markers. MHCII+CD11b+CD11c− macrophages, CD3e+ T cells and CD19+ B cells were markedly increased in the pancreases of SENP1-aP2KO versus the Ctrl mice (Supplementary Fig. 3D for FACS and Fig. 3k for quantifications). Subset T cells play a key role in regulation of inflammation and immune tolerance. We observed that Th1 (IFN-γ+CD4+) and Th17 (IL-17+CD4+) effector T-cell subsets expanded concomitant with reduction of regulatory T-cell subset (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) in the pancreatic lymph nodes of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 3E–G for FACS and Fig. 3l for quantifications). We also observed an increase in activated dendritic cells in the lymph node of pancreases (Fig. 3m). Moreover, an autoantigen NRP-V7-positive CD8+ T cells, targeting a peptide from islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein, were detected in the pancreatic lymph nodes and the spleen of SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 12 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 3H for FACS and Fig. 3n,o for quantifications).

Moreover, an autoantigen NRP-V7-positive CD8+ T cells, targeting a peptide from islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein, were detected in the pancreatic lymph nodes and the spleen of SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 12 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 3H for FACS and Fig. 3n,o for quantifications). All of the events suggest autoimmune responses occur in the pancreases of SENP1-deficient mice, consistent with that T1DM is an autoimmune disease in which insulin deficiency is a consequence of immunological destruction of the pancreatic β cells.\n\nPATs secret cytokines\n\nThe proinflammatory cytokines overproduction in early phase of disease could serve as a main reason for immunologic tolerance break and immune cell expansion in diabetes. We found that the circulating proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and IL-Iβ, but not IFN-γ, were significantly elevated in the SENP1-deficient mice before the onset of diabetes at the age of 7 weeks (Fig. 4a). However, the levels of circulating cytokines might be too low to induce systemic autoimmune responses. Consistently, SENP1-deficient mice had normal cardiac function and vascular reactivity. These mice exhibit increased systemic cytokines and cardiac myocarditis at the age of 14 weeks or older, indicating a prevalence of diabetic phenotype in the SENP1-deficient mice.\n\nAdipose tissue has been recognized as the largest endocrine organ and produces a large amount of cytokines. We reasoned that PATs might express high levels of cytokines to induce local (pancreas) inflammatory responses and diabetic phenotype in SENP1-deficient mice. Indeed, PATs from SENP1-aP2KO mice expressed high levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β at the age of 7 weeks (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 4A). We also compared cytokine transcripts expressed in the adipocytes from PATs, subcutaneous (inguinal) and gonadal and peri-renal adipose tissues at the age of 7 weeks. Ctrl mice expressed little basal cytokines in all adipose tissues. We did not observe significant differences for SENP1 deletion in different adipose depots. However, SENP1 deletion strongly enhanced gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the PATs compared with other adipose depots (Fig. 4c). To exclude the impact of macrophages or T cells affects the cytokine concentration, we examined immune cell numbers and cell-type-specific cytokine expression in the pancreas and PATs. We did not detect significant differences in cell numbers of macrophages and T cells in PATs (Fig. 4d) or pancreas of Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 7 weeks. Moreover, expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β by isolated pancreatic T cells and macrophages were >10-fold lower than isolated PAT adipocytes as measured by ELISA (Fig. 4e). Similar results were obtained from measuring intracellular cytokine levels in adipocytes, T cells and macrophages within PATs by FACS on intracellular staining of single cells (Supplementary Fig. 4B), suggesting that peri-pancreatic adipocytes primarily contribute to cytokine production in SENP1-aP2KO mice before the onset of diabetes. Of note, we detected macrophages infiltration into the pancreases of SENP1-aP2KO mice at later phases (14 weeks), and these macrophages expressed high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 4C–D).\n\nWe reasoned that the local high concentrations of cytokines might induce chemokine expression in adjacent pancreatic islets to recruit immune cells. It is known that CCL5 (RANTES, the CCR5 ligand) can direct recruitment of immune cells to inflammation sites or to autoimmune targets that may contribute to type-1 diabetic development. We analysed gene expression of chemokines that had been reported to be expressed in the pancreas. We found that CCL5 was strongly upregulated in the pancreatic islets of SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 7 weeks before disease the onset. CCL2, CCL21, CXCL19 and CXCL10 were weakly upregulated in pancreatic islets of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 4f). Expression of CCL5 in islet β cells was confirmed by co-staining of CCL5 with insulin (Fig. 4g). However, upregulation of CCL5 was not detected in other tissues of SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 7 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 4E), suggesting a specific effect of PAT-derived cytokines on adjacent islets. This is consistent with human protein expression database that CCL5 is only detected in pancreas but not in other tissues except blood and immune cells (GeneCards; http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CCL5). We then directly tested whether proinflammatory cytokines secreted from PATs could induce CCL5 expression in isolated islets. CCL5 mRNA in islets was significantly upregulated by conditional media of SENP1-aP2KO pancreatic adipocytes, and this upregulation was reduced by a neutralizing antibody to IL-6, TNF or IL-1β, and blunted by a combination of the three antibodies (Fig. 4h). These data suggest that high levels of local proinflammatory cytokines secreted from PATs induces CCL5 expression in islets, which in turn recruits immune cells into pancreas, causing damages of β cells.",

To this end, isolated normal mouse pancreatic islets were incubated with culture supernatant of adipocytes from Ctrl or SENP1-aP2KO, and islet structure and apoptosis were monitored by Live/Dead viability/Cytotoxicity assays. We found that culture supernatant from adipocytes of SENP1-aP2KO strongly induced β-cell death and pancreatic disruption (Fig. 4i,j), suggesting that cytokines from peri-pancreatic adipocytes of SENP1-aP2KO mice have direct cytotoxic effects on pancreatic islet.\n\nTaken together, these results indicate that high local concentrations of cytokines derived from PATs not only upregulate CCL5 expression and CCL5-mediated infiltration of immune cells in pancreas but also directly induce cytotoxic damages on pancreatic islets.\n\nSENP1 deletion augments NF-κB dependent inflammation\n\nIt has been proposed that adipose tissue depots originate from distinct precursor cells are functionally diverse, and modulate disease processes in a depot-specific manner. We observed that peri-pancreatic adipocytes from SENP1-aP2KO exhibit 1.8-fold smaller cell sizes (Fig. 5a,b) with two- to three folds more cell numbers than the Ctrl adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5A–B). Moreover, peri-pancreatic adipocytes from SENP1-aP2KO mice expressed reduced differentiation markers including fatty acid synthase, adipose triglyceride lipase and lipoprotein lipase (Fig. 5c). In contrast, gonadal and subcutaneous inguinal adipocytes in SENP1-aP2KO mice exhibited a much weaker phenotype; they showed a smaller size at old ages (14 weeks) without significant increases in cell numbers; these phenotypes likely contribute to the reduced fat pad weight (Supplementary Fig. 5C–H) and total body weight of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-PdgfRKO mice. These data are consistent with the notion that a reduced state of adipocyte differentiation correlates with enhanced proinflammatory phenotype in some adipose depots.\n\nPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) is not only the master regulator of adipogenesis but also plays a critical role in repressing inflammatory responses in a SUMOylation-dependent manner. Therefore, we first examined whether PPARγ was a SENP1 target in adipocytes. We found that expression of total PPARγ mRNA and protein levels were similar in Ctrl and SENP1-deficient adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5I,J). Although PPARγ was SUMOylated in both Ctrl and SENP1-null adipocytes, no significant difference was detected between Ctrl and SENP1-deficient cells (Supplementary Fig. 5K,L). These results suggest that SUMOylation of PPARγ may not contribute to the reduced adipogenesis and enhanced cytokine production in PATs of SENP1-deficient mice.\n\nNF-κB is a critical activator of genes for inflammation and immune regulation. We observed that phosphorylations of IKK, IκBα and NF-κB subunit p65/RelA were increased with concomitant reduction of total IκBα in the adipose tissues of SENP1-aP2KO mice. In contrast, phosphorylation and total levels of ERK1/2 in adipose tissues were not affected by SENP1 deletion (Fig. 5d). NF-κB was further determined by intracellular staining for phosphor-p65/RelA in PAT sections. We observed phosphor-p65/RelA positive staining in the PAT, but not in the pancreas (Fig. 5e). The phosphor-p65/RelA was much stronger in SENP1-aP2KO adipocytes, marked by adipocyte-specific marker FABP4 (Fig. 5f,g). However, phosphor-p65/RelA was not localized with a macrophage marker F4/80 (Fig. 5h). We further performed p65/RelA chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in Ctrl and SENP1-deficient cells isolated from Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice. We observed increased p65/RelA bindings to the IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α promoters in SENP1-aP2KO adipocytes (Fig. 5i,j). To directly test whether SENP1 deficiency regulates the NF-κB activation and cytokine production in adipocytes in vitro, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were first differentiated into the mature adipocytes and then transfected with a Ctrl or SENP1 short interfering RNA (siRNA). In the adipocytes with the SENP1 knockdown, phosphorylated IKK, IκBα and NF-κB p65/RelA levels were increased markedly (Fig. 5k). The gene expressions of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1 β, but not IFN-γ) from adipocytes were significantly higher in SENP1 knock",

In the adipocytes with the SENP1 knockdown, phosphorylated IKK, IκBα and NF-κB p65/RelA levels were increased markedly (Fig. 5k). The gene expressions of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1 β, but not IFN-γ) from adipocytes were significantly higher in SENP1 knockdown cells (Fig. 5l), which concurs with our observations in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice, as well as in adipocytes isolated from these mice. Conversely, overexpression of SENP1 into SENP1-deficient adipocytes markedly decreased phospho-p65/RelA and cytokine productions. Taken together, our results suggest that SENP1 directly regulates the activation of NF-κB and cytokine production in adipocytes.\n\nSENP1 deletion augments NEMO SUMOylation in adipocytes\n\nOf the NF-κB components, SUMOylation of IKK subunit NEMO and NF-κB p65/RelA are thought to be critical events for the activation of IKK-NF-κB signalling. SENP2 can efficiently deSUMOylate NEMO to blunt NF-κB activation in a 293T overexpression system and SENP1 was proposed to have a similar role. To determine the role of SENP1 in pancreatic proinflammatory phenotype and NF-κB regulation, we first examined expression of SENPs in PATs. The SENPs can be divided into three families. The first family members SENP1 and SENP2 have broad specificity for the three mammalian SUMOs (SUMO1–3), while the second family (SENP3 and SENP5) and the third family (SENP6 and SENP7) prefer SUMO2/3 as substrates. We found that SENP1, but not SENP2, was abundantly expressed in mouse adipose tissues. Deletion of SENP1 had no effects on expression of other SENPs (Supplementary Fig. 6). SUMOylations of NEMO and p65/RelA were determined by co-immunoprecipitation from the denaturing adipocyte extracts with specific antibodies followed by western blotting with anti-SUMO1. No difference in p65/RelA was detected between Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 6a). However, an extra band appeared ∼70 kDa in the SENP1-aP2KO adipocyte extracts for NEMO (Fig. 6b). Increased NEMO SUMOylation in SENP1-KO adipocyte was further confirmed by overexpression of Flag-NEMO (Fig. 6c). It is reported that NEMO SUMOylation and IKK activation are enhanced by stress responses such as oxidative stress, inflammatory stimuli and DNA damage in different cell types. We observed that DNA damage agent etoposide VP16 induced phosphorylation of IKK and p65/RelA in adipocytes, and SENP1 deletion enhanced both basal and stress-induced IKK and p65/RelA activation (Fig. 6d). SENP1 deletion also enhanced both basal and stress-induced NEMO SUMOylation in adipocytes as detected by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-NEMO followed by immunoblotting with anti-SUMO1 (Fig. 6e).\n\nIt has been reported that NEMO can be SUMOylated at K277 and K309 (ref.). To determine the functional importance of SUMO modifications in regulating NF-κB signalling in adipocytes, a single (K277R or K309R) and double lysine to arginine mutants (DM) were constructed as Flag-NEMO. Wild type (WT) or mutant Flag-NEMO was then was expressed in peri-pancreatic adipocytes isolated from SENP1-aP2KO mice, and the exogenous NEMO versus endogenous NEMO was about 1:1 ratio (Fig. 6f). While phosphorylation of NF-κB p65/RelA was slightly increased by NEMO-WT, it was mildly decreased by NEMO K277R and strongly decreased by NEMO K309R or the double mutant as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 6f) and intracellular staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated p-p65/RelA (Fig. 6g,h). These data suggest that SUMO-deficient NEMO mutants (NEMO K309R and NEMO-DM) function as dominant negative forms. NF-κB-dependent cytokine expression was then determined by ELISA in the NEMO-transfected cells. NEMO mutants had similar effects on the protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines in adipocytes (Fig. 6i), supporting that SUMOylated NEMO enhances cytokine expression.\n\nClinical relevance of adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice\n\nTo determine whether our studies from the adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice have clinical relevance, we first investigated whether there is a correlation between SENP1 expression in adipocytes of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and human T1DM patients. The NOD mouse, a popularly used model for T1DM, developed diabetes with a late onset at the age of 14 weeks. Consistent with reports, we observed the incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the NOD mouse was 60–80% in females and 20–30% in males (Fig.",

The NOD mouse, a popularly used model for T1DM, developed diabetes with a late onset at the age of 14 weeks. Consistent with reports, we observed the incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the NOD mouse was 60–80% in females and 20–30% in males (Fig. 7a). Mouse strains with an adipocyte-specific deletion of SENP1 appeared more severe in hyperglycaemia and islet disruption compared with NOD mice at the same age (Fig. 7b versus Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 2). Importantly, we observed an age-dependent reduction of SENP1 expression in PATs of NOD mice (Fig. 7c), correlating with the T1DM progression in NOD mice.\n\nWe next investigated a correlation between SENP1 expression and proinflammatory cytokines in NOD model and human T1DM patients. To this end, venous blood was drawn from consenting volunteers (healthy and diabetic subjects; Supplementary Table 1). Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in T1DM patients compared with the normal cohorts (Fig. 7d). The levels of cytokines from SENP1-aP2KO at the age of 12 weeks are at similar ranges as human serum with T1DM. NOD develops diabetes as a result of Th1 dominant IFN-γ-induced insulitis and leukocyte infiltrations of the pancreatic islets. Consistently, NOD mice exhibit increased plasma IFN-γ with lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines compared with SENP1-aP2KO mice and serum from human T1DM patients (Fig. 7e versus Fig. 7d). We then tested whether serum could directly induce β-cell death and pancreatic disruption. To this end, isolated normal mouse pancreatic islets were cultured with serum collected from Ctrl, SENP1-aP2KO and NOD mice, or collected from normal human and T1DM patients. Islet structure and apoptosis was monitored by Live/Dead viability/Cytotoxicity assays. Serum from SENP1-aP2KO mice, NOD mice and human T1DM all induced disruption and pancreatic cell death (Fig. 7f,g). Taken together, our results support that SENP1-aP2KO mice is a clinically relevant model for human diabetes.\n\nWe also tested whether insulin could prevent or delay T1DM progression in SENP1-aP2KO mice. Since T1DM is an islet-reactive T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease and insulin and its precursor (pre)proinsulin are major targets of islet-reactive T cells, both in humans and in NOD mice. It has been hypothesized that that repeated subcutaneous insulin administration prevents disease by acting as a vaccination protocol potentially restoring immune tolerance. Recent data suggest that short-term subcutaneous insulin administration delays but does not prevent diabetes in NOD mice, likely by inducing a state of ‘β-cell rest' that would make β cells less vulnerable to metabolic stress, apoptosis and possibly to immune-mediated destruction. Our results indicated that prophylactic insulin therapy in SENP1-deficient mice at the age of 5 weeks for 9 weeks only partially ameliorates development of diabetes phenotypes including immune cell infiltration, β-cell apoptosis and islet disruptions (Supplementary Fig. 7A–F).\n\nNF-κB inhibitors ameliorate diabetes progression\n\nTo establish a causative link between SENP1-dependent NF-κB activation and type 1 diabetes, SENP1-aP2KO mice were treated at the age of 5 weeks with intraperitoneal injection of NF-κB activation inhibitor II JSH-23 (2 mg kg−1 in 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) diluted with PBS) twice a week for 6 weeks. JSH-23 had no effects on body weight, blood glucose and lipid profile in the Ctrl mice. However, administration of JSH-23 in SENP1-aP2KO mice diminished SENP1 deletion-induced elevation of blood glucose (Fig. 8a) and reduction of insulin levels in blood (Fig. 8b) concomitant with attenuated islet damages (Fig. 8c). These normalized phenotypes in JSH-23-treated SENP1-aP2KO mice correlated with basal levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the PATs of these mice (Fig. 8d). No CCL5 expression in islets (Fig. 8e,f) and apoptotic β-cells (Fig. 8g) were detected in the JSH-23-treated group. These results support a critical role of SENP1-dependent NF-κB activity in T1DM progression in SENP1-aP2KO mice.\n\nHFD augments diabetic phenotype in SENP1 deficient mice\n\nTo determine the role of the SENP1-NEMO-NF-κB-pathway in adipocyte inflammation and its link to both T1DM and T2DM, we have examined the phenotype of SENP1-aP2KO mice under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. HFD increased fat weight in all adipose depots including epididymal fat and PATs in Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 9a,b). PATs from SENP1-aP2KO exhibit 1.8-fold smaller cell sizes with 2–3-fold more cell numbers than the Ctrl adipocytes under normal chow and this phenotype was more marked under HFD (Fig. 9c), suggesting that HFD may stimulate adipogenesis in",

PATs from SENP1-aP2KO mice expressed high levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β at the age of 7 weeks before the onset of diabetes, and these proinflammatory cytokines were higher in the PATs compared with other adipose depots (Fig. 4). HFD significantly augmented the cytokine production in PATs (Fig. 9d) and subsequent disruption of islet structures in SENP1-aP2KO (Fig. 9e). Consistently, HFD increased body weight (Fig. 9f) and accelerated hyperglycaemia with an onset at the age of 8 weeks (versus 12 weeks under chow) in SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 9g). Basal and glucose-stimulated insulin levels were significantly reduced in SENP1-aP2KO mice. Moreover, HFD caused further reduction of insulin levels in SENP1-aP2KO mice, but not in Ctrl mice (Fig. 9h–j). Although similar insulin responses were observed between SENP1-deficient mice and Ctrl under standard chow in the ITT assay, HFD significantly induced insulin resistance in Ctrl mice and more severe phenotype was observed in SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 9k,l). Moreover, liver insulin resistance, a hallmark of obesity-linked T2DM development, was detected under basal but more pronounced under HFD conditions in SENP1 knockout (KO) mice (Fig. 9m,n). Taken together, our data demonstrate that HFD augments both T1DM and T2DM phenotypes in SENP1-aP2KO mice.",

    "content": "Results\n\nDiscovery of single variant BP associations\n\nWe genotyped 192,763 individuals from 51 studies, and assessed association of 242,296 SNVs with diastolic BP (DBP), systolic BP (SBP), pulse pressure (PP) and hypertension (HTN; Supplementary Tables 1, 2 and 3; Methods). An overview of the SNV discovery study design is given in Figure 1. A fixed effects meta-analysis for each trait was performed using study-level association summary statistics from i) samples of European (EUR) ancestry (up to 165,276 individuals), and ii) a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of the EUR and additional South Asian (SAS) ancestry samples (EUR_SAS; up to 192,763 individuals). Two analyses of DBP, SBP and PP were performed, one in which the trait was inverse normal transformed and a second in which the raw phenotype was analysed. Both sets of results were consistent (Methods), therefore to minimise sensitivity to deviations from normality in the analysis of rare variants, the results from the analyses of the transformed traits were used for discovery. Strong correlations between the BP traits were observed across studies (Methods), hence no adjustment of significance thresholds for independent trait testing was applied.\n\nThe discovery meta-analyses identified 51 genomic regions with genome-wide significant (GWS) evidence of association with at least one of the four BP traits tested (P<5x10-8; Supplementary Table 4). There were 46 regions associated in the EUR_SAS samples, of which 14 were novel (Supplementary Figure 1). An additional five regions were GWS in the EUR only meta-analyses of which three were novel (Supplementary Figure 2). In total, 17 genomic regions were identified that were GWS for at least one BP trait that have not been previously reported.\n\nReplication of single variant BP associations\n\nNext we sought support for our findings, in an independent replication dataset comprising of 18 studies, 15 of which were from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology+ (CHARGE+) exome chip blood pressure consortium (Figure 1; Liu et al. Nature Genetics, submitted). Variants were selected for replication first using the larger (transformed) EUR_SAS data, with additional variants from the (transformed) EUR data also selected. SNVs were selected if they mapped outside of known BP genomic regions and had MAF≥0.05 and P<1x10-5 or MAF<0.05 and P<1x10-4 with at least one BP trait, i.e. choosing a lower significance threshold for the selection of rare variants (full details of the selection criteria are provided in the Methods). In total 81 candidate SNVs were selected for replication (Supplementary Table 5). Eighty variants were selected from EUR_SAS (transformed) results and one SNV at the ZNF101 locus from the EUR (transformed) analyses. The results for EUR_SAS and EUR were consistent (association statistics were correlated, ρ=0.9 across ancestries for each of the traits). Of the 81 variants, 30 SNVs were selected for association with DBP as the primary trait, 26 for SBP, 19 for PP and 6 for HTN, with the primary trait defined as the BP trait with the smallest association P-value in the EUR-SAS discovery analyses.\n\nMeta-analyses were performed on results from analyses of untransformed DBP, SBP, PP and HTN (as only results of untransformed traits were available from CHARGE+) in (i) up to 125,713 individuals of EUR descent, and (ii) up to 155,063 individuals of multiple ethnicities (4,632 of Hispanic descent, 22,077 of African American descent, 2,641 SAS samples with the remainder EUR; Figure 1). Given that a large proportion of the ancestries in the trans-ethnic meta-analyses were not included in our discovery samples, we used the EUR meta-analyses as the main data set for replication, but we also report any additional associations identified within the larger trans-ethnic dataset.\n\nNovel BP-SNV associations were identified based on two criteria (Figure 1; Methods). Firstly, replication of the primary BP trait-SNV association was sought at a Bonferroni adjusted P-value threshold in the replication data (P≤6.17x10-4, assuming α=0.05 for 81 SNVs tested and same direction of effect; Methods) without the need for GWS. Secondly, meta-analyses of discovery and replication results across all four (untransformed) BP traits were performed to assess the overall level of support across all samples for the 81 candidate SNVs; those BP-SNV associations that were GWS (with statistical support in the replication studies; P<0.05 and the same direction of effect) were also declared as novel.\n\nSeventeen SNV-BP associations formally replicated with concordant direction of effect at a Bonferroni adjusted significance level for the primary trait. Fourteen were in the EUR meta-analyses, and amongst these was a rare non-synonymous (ns) SNV mapping to COL21A1 (Table 1, Supplementary Table 6). Three associations were in the trans-ethnic meta-analyses, these included two rare nsSNVs in RBM47 and RRAS (Table 1, Supplementary Table 7; Methods).\n\nIn addition to the 17 SNV-BP trait associations that formally replicated, we identified 13 further SNV-associations that were GWS in the combined (discovery and replication) meta-analyses. Ten of these were GWS in the combined EUR analyses, (",

Three associations were in the trans-ethnic meta-analyses, these included two rare nsSNVs in RBM47 and RRAS (Table 1, Supplementary Table 7; Methods).\n\nIn addition to the 17 SNV-BP trait associations that formally replicated, we identified 13 further SNV-associations that were GWS in the combined (discovery and replication) meta-analyses. Ten of these were GWS in the combined EUR analyses, (Table 2; Supplementary Tables 6 and 8a), and three were GWS in the combined trans-ethnic meta-analyses (Table 2; Supplementary Tables 7 and 8b).\n\nThis gives a total of 30 novel SNV-BP associations (15 SNV-DBP, 9 SNV-SBP and 6 SNV-PP; Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Figures 3 and 4). Five of the SNVs were GWS with more than one BP trait (Figure 2: Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Table 8). Four loci (CERS5, TBX2, RGL3 and OBFC1) had GWS associations with HTN in addition to GWS associations with DBP and SBP. The PRKAG1 locus had GWS associations with both SBP and PP.\n\nConditional analyses were performed to identify secondary signals of association within the novel BP loci. The RAREMETALWORKER (RMW) package (Methods) allows conditional analyses to be performed using summary level data. Hence, analyses of the transformed primary traits and HTN were re-run in RMW across the discovery studies (Figure 3). The results of the RMW single variant tests were consistent with the initial discovery analyses (Supplementary Information). Given the RMW analyses were based on our discovery samples, the larger EUR-SAS data was used as the main analysis to increase power, but we also report any additional associations with evidence in EUR.\n\nWe identified secondary independent signals of association in four loci, PREX1, PRKAG1 and RRP1B within the EUR_SAS analyses and COL21A1 in the EUR analyses (Pconditional<1x10-4, Bonferroni adjusted for ~500 variants within each region; Methods; Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). Three independent association signals were identified in the MYH6 locus in the EUR_SAS analyses (Supplementary Table 11).\n\nGene-based BP associations\n\nTo improve statistical power to detect associations in genes harbouring rare variants, analytical methods that combine effects of variants across a gene into a single test have been devised and are implemented in the RMW package. We applied the gene-based sequence kernel association test (SKAT) and Burden tests to the RMW dataset (MAF<0.05 or MAF<0.01; Figure 3; Methods). One previously unidentified BP gene (A2ML1) was associated with HTN (P= 7.73x10-7) in the EUR_SAS studies and also in EUR studies (Supplementary Table 12; Bonferroni-corrected threshold of significance P<2.8x10-6, after adjusting for 17,996 genes tested, Methods). The gene showed residual association with the primary BP trait after conditioning on the most associated SNV in the gene (Pconditional=5.00x10-4; Supplementary Table 12), suggesting that the association is due to multiple rare variants in the gene. One nonsense variant (rs199651558, p.Arg893*, MAF=3.5x10-4) was observed, and there were multiple missense variants (Figure 4). A2ML1 encodes alpha-2-macroglobulin-like 1 protein, and is a member of the alpha macroglobulin superfamily, which comprises protease inhibitors targeting a wide range of substrates. Mutations in this gene are associated with a disorder clinically related to Noonan syndrome, a developmental disorder which involves cardiac abnormalities. We sought replication in the CHARGE+ studies for this gene, however there was no evidence of association with HTN (P= 0.45). Given the very low frequencies of the variants involved, however, studies in which the variants are polymorphic will be required to replicate the association with HTN. The DBH gene was found to be associated with DBP using the SKAT test (P=2.88x10-6). However, this was not due to multiple rare variants as the association was driven by rs77273740 (Supplementary Table 5) and the SNV was not validated in the replication samples.\n\nRare and common variant associations in established BP loci\n\nOf the 67 established BP loci, 35 loci were on the Exome chip (N=43 SNVs or close proxies r2>0.7). All 43 SNVs had at least nominal evidence of association with BP in our discovery samples (P<0.01; Supplementary Table 13). We also assessed if any of the established BP loci contained coding variants that are associated with BP traits and in LD (r2>0.2) with the known BP variants on the Exome chip (Supplementary Table 13), using the 1000G phase 3 release for LD annotation. Focusing on SNVs that were GWS for any BP trait from our transformed discovery data for either ancestry, there were 25 coding variants, of which 6 were predicted to be damaging at loci labelled CDC25A, SLC39A8, HFE, ULK4, ST7L-CAPZA1-MOV10 and CYP1A1-ULK3. Three of these are published variants at loci labelled SLC39A8, HFE and ST7-C",

Three of these are published variants at loci labelled SLC39A8, HFE and ST7-CAPZA1-MOV10. At CYP1A1-ULK3, the coding variant was in moderate LD with the reported variant, but was less significantly associated with DBP in our EUR_SAS dataset (P=2.24x10-8 compared to P=1.68x10-15 for the published variant). At the ULK4 locus the predicted damaging coding variant had similar association as the published coding variant (predicted to be benign), and prior work has already indicated several associated nsSNVs in strong LD in ULK4 . The nsSNV within the CDC25A locus (rs11718350 in SPINK8) had similar association with DBP as the intergenic published SNV in our EUR_SAS dataset (P=2.00x10-8 compared to P=2.27x10-8 for the published variant). Overall at least 5 of the known loci are consistent with having a coding causal variant.\n\nGene-based SKAT tests of all genes that map within 1 Mb of a previously reported SNV association (Supplementary Table 14), indicated no genes with multiple rare or low-frequency variant associations. Single variant conditional analyses showed that rs33966350, a rare nonsense variant in ENPEP (MAF=0.01) was associated with SBP (Pconditional=1.61x10-5) in the EUR_SAS samples (Supplementary Tables 14 and 15; Methods) independently of the known SNV (rs6825911). ENPEP encodes aminopeptidase A (APA) an enzyme of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that converts angiotensin II (AngII) to AngIII.\n\nThere were no other established loci with convincing low-frequency or rare SNV associations in the EUR_SAS samples. However, HOXC4, had evidence of a second independent signal with a rare missense SNV in EUR samples (rs78731604; MAF=0.005, Pconditional= 5.76x10-5; Supplementary Table 15). The secondary signal in the HOXC4 region, mapped to CALCOCO1, ~300kb from the known SNV. The gene association (MAF≤0.01, P=2.37x10-5) was below the required significance threshold and attributable to rs78731604, which is not predicted to have detrimental effects on protein structure. Therefore, replication of this association is required. Three loci (ST7L-CAPZA1-MOV10, FIGN-GRB14, and TBX5-TBX3) had evidence of a second independent signal in the region in EUR_SAS samples with a common variant (Pconditional<1x10-4; Supplementary Table 15) that has not been previously reported.\n\nHaving identified 30 novel loci associated with BP traits, as well as additional new independent SNVs at four novel loci and five known loci, we calculated the percent of the trait variance explained (Methods). This was 2.08%/2.11%/1.15% for SBP/DBP/PP for the 43 previously reported BP-SNVs covered in our dataset, increasing to 3.38%/3.41%/2.08% respectively with the inclusion of the 30 lead SNVs from novel loci, plus new independent SNV-BP associations identified from novel and known loci.\n\nEffect of BP SNVs on cardiovascular traits & risk factors\n\nAmongst our novel BP-SNV associations, some have previously been reported to be associated with other cardiovascular traits and risk factors (Supplementary Table 16); these include coronary heart disease (CHD: PHACTR1, ABO), QT interval (RNF207), heart rate (MYH6), and cholesterol levels (2q36.3, ABO, ZNF101).\n\nTo test the impact of BP variants on cardiovascular endpoints and risk factors we created three weighted genetic risk scores (GRS) according to SBP/DBP/PP based on the newly identified and previously published BP variants (up to N=125; Methods). The GRS models were used to test the causal effect of BP on the following traits: ischemic stroke (including the subtypes, cardiometabolic, large and small vessel), CHD, heart failure, left ventricular mass, left ventricular wall thickness, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c), triglycerides, total cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio adjusted BMI, height and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Methods). As expected, BP was positively associated with increased CHD risk (OR [95% CI]=1.39[1.22-1.59] per 10mmHg increase in SBP, P=6.07×10-7; 1.62[1.28-2.05] per 10mmHg increase in DBP, P=5.99x10-5; 1.70[1.34-2.16] per 10mmHg increase in PP, P=1.20x10-5; Table 3), and increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR [95% CI]=1.93[1.",

The positive association with ischemic stroke was primarily due to large vessel stroke (Table 3). DBP and SBP were also positively associated with left ventricular mass (9.57 [3.98-15.17] gram increase per 10mmHg increase in DBP, P=8.02x10-4 and 5.13 [1.77-8.48] gram increase per 10mmHg increase in SBP, P=0.0027) and left ventricular wall thickness (0.10 [0.06-0.13] cm increase per 10mmHg increase in DBP, P=1.88x10-8 and 0.05 [0.03-0.07] cm increase per 10mmHg increase in SBP, P=5.52x10-6, Table 3). There was no convincing evidence to support the BP associated variants having an effect on lipid levels (P>0.1), BMI (P>0.005), waist hip ratio adjusted BMI (P>0.1), height (P>0.06), eGFR (P>0.02) or heart failure (P>0.04). The causal associations with CHD, stroke, and left ventricular measures augment the results from a previous association analysis using 29 BP variants. Our data strongly support the previous observations of no causal relationship between BP and eGFR. Lack of evidence of a BP effect with heart failure may only be due to lack of power, as the association was in the expected direction.\n\nPossible functional variants at BP loci and candidate genes\n\nTwenty-six of our newly discovered BP associated SNVs had MAF≥0.05 and therefore due to extensive LD with other SNVs not genotyped on the Exome array, identifying the causal genes requires additional information. If a SNV is associated with increased or decreased expression of a particular gene, i.e. it is an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) this suggests the gene on which the SNV acts could be in the causal pathway. To help identify potential candidate causal genes in the novel BP loci (Supplementary Table 9), information from publicly available eQTL databases was investigated (MuTHER for LCL, adipose and skin and GTEx for nine tissues including the heart and tibial artery; Methods).\n\nThe DBP increasing allele of the nsSNV, rs7302981-A, was associated with increased expression of CERS5 in: LCLs (PMuTHER=3.13x10-72) skin (PMuTHER=2.40x10-58) adipose (PMuTHER=2.87x10-54) and nerve (PGTEx=4.5x10-12) (Supplementary Figure 5). Additional testing (Methods) provided no evidence against colocalisation of the eQTL and DBP association signals, implicating CERS5 as a candidate causal gene for this DBP locus. CERS5 (LAG1 homolog, ceramide synthase 5) is involved in the synthesis of ceramide, a lipid molecule involved in several cellular signaling pathways. Cers5 knockdown has been shown to reduce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in mouse models. However, it is unclear whether the blood pressure raising effects at this locus are the cause or result of any potential effects on cardiac hypertrophy. Future studies investigating this locus in relation to parameters of cardiac hypertrophy and function (e.g. ventricular wall thickness) should help address this question.\n\nThe DBP raising allele of the nsSNV (rs867186-A) was associated with increased expression of PROCR in adipose tissue (PMuTHER=3.24x10-15) and skin (PMuTHER=1.01x10-11) (Supplementary Figure 5). There was no evidence against colocalisation of the eQTL and DBP association thus supporting PROCR as a candidate causal gene. PROCR encodes the Endothelial Protein C receptor, a serine protease involved in the blood coagulation pathway, and rs867186 has previously been associated with coagulation and haematological factors. The PP decreasing allele of, rs10407022-T, which is predicted to have detrimental effects on protein structure (Methods) was associated with increased expression of AMH in muscle (PGTEx=9.95x10-15), thyroid (PGTEx=8.54x10-7), nerve (PGTEx=7.15x10-8), tibial artery (PGTEx=6.46x10-9), adipose (PGTEx=4.69x10-7), and skin (PGTEx=5.88x10-8) (Supplementary Figure 5). There was no evidence against colocalisation of the eQTL and PP association, which supports AMH",

There was no evidence against colocalisation of the eQTL and PP association, which supports AMH as a candidate causal gene for PP. Low AMH levels have been previously associated with hypertensive status in women with the protein acting as a marker of ovarian reserve. The intergenic SBP raising allele of rs4728142-A was associated with reduced expression of IRF5 in skin (PMuTHER=5.24x10-31) and LCLs (PMuTHER=1.39x10-34), whole blood (PGTEx=3.12x10-7) and tibial artery (PGTEx=1.71x10-7).\n\nThree novel rare nsSNVs were identified that map to RBM47, RRAS (both associated with SBP) and COL21A1 (associated with PP). They had larger effect sizes than common variant associations (>1.5mmHg per allele; Supplementary Figure 6) and were predicted to have detrimental effects on protein structure (Supplementary Table 16; Methods). In RBM47, rs35529250 (p.Gly538Arg) is located in a highly conserved region of the gene and was most strongly associated with SBP (MAF=0.008; +1.59 mmHg per T allele; P=5.90x10-9). RBM47 encodes the RNA binding motif protein 47 and is responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of RNA, through its direct and selective binding with the molecule. In RRAS, rs61760904 (p.Asp133Asn) was most strongly associated with SBP (MAF=0.007; +1.51 mmHg per T allele; P=8.45x10-8). RRAS encodes a small GTPase belonging to the Ras subfamily of proteins H-RAS, N-RAS, and K-RAS and has been implicated in actin cytoskeleton remodelling, and controlling cell proliferation, migration and cycle processes. The nsSNV in COL21A1 (rs200999181, p.Gly665Val) was most strongly associated with PP (MAF=0.001; +3.14 mmHg per A allele; P=1.93x10-9). COL21A1 encodes the collagen alpha-1 chain precursor of type XXI collagen, a member of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with an interrupted triple helix) family of proteins. The gene is detected in many tissues, including the heart and aorta. Based on our results, these three genes represent good candidates for functional follow-up. However, due to the incomplete coverage of all SNVs across the region on the Exome chip, it is possible that other non-genotyped SNVs may better explain some of these associations. We therefore checked for variants in LD (r2>0.3) with these three rare nsSNVs in the UK10K + 1000G dataset to ascertain if there are other candidate SNVs at these loci (Supplementary Table 17). There were no SNVs within 1Mb of the RBM47 locus in LD with the BP associated SNV. At the COL21A1 locus there were only SNVs in moderate LD, and these were annotated as intronic, intergenic or in the 5’UTR. At the RRAS locus, there were two SNVs in strong LD with the BP associated SNV, which both mapped to introns of SCAF1 and are not predicted to be damaging. All SNVs in LD at both loci were rare as expected (Supplementary Table 17) supporting a role for rare variants. Hence, the rare BP associated nsSNVs at RBM47, COL21A1 and RRAS remain the best causal candidates.\n\nPathway and network analyses\n\nTo identify connected gene sets and pathways implicated by the BP associated genes we used Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variant Associations (MAGENTA) and GeneGo MetaCore (Thomson Reuters, UK). MAGENTA tests for over-representation of BP associated genes in pre-annotated pathways (gene sets) (Methods and Supplementary Table 18a). GeneGo Metacore identifies potential gene networks. The MAGENTA analysis was used for hypothesis generation and results were compared with the GeneGo Metacore outputs to cross-validate findings.\n\nUsing MAGENTA there was an enrichment (P<0.01 and FDR<5% in either the EUR_SAS or the EUR participants) of six gene sets with DBP, three gene sets with HTN and two gene sets for SBP (Supplementary Table 18b). The RNA polymerase I promoter clearance (chromatin modification) pathway showed the most evidence of enrichment with genes associated with DBP (PReactome=8.4x10-5, FDR=2.48%). NOTCH signalling was the most associated pathway with SBP (PReactome = 3.00x10-4, FDR = 5%) driven by associations at the FURIN gene. The inorganic cation anion solute carrier (SLC) transporter pathway had the most evidence of enrichment by HTN associated genes (PReactome=8.00x10-6, FDR=2.13%).\n\nUsing GeneGo MetaCore, five network processes were enriched (FDR<5%; Methods; Supplementary Tables 19 and 20).",

These included several networks with genes known to influence vascular tone and BP: inflammation signalling, P=1.14x10-4 and blood vessel development P=2.34x10-4. The transcription and chromatin modification network (P=2.85x10-4) was also enriched, a pathway that was also highlighted in the MAGENTA analysis, with overlap of the same histone genes (HIST1H4C, HIST1H2AC, HIST1H2BC, HIST1H1T) and has also been recently reported in an integrative network analysis of published BP loci and whole blood expression profiling. Two cardiac development pathways were enriched: the oxidative stress-driven (ROS/NADPH) (P=4.12x10-4) and the Wnt/β-catenin/integrin-driven (P=0.0010). Both these cardiac development pathways include the MYH6, MYH7, and TBX2 genes, revealing a potential overlap with cardiomyopathies and hypertension, and suggesting some similarity in the underlying biological mechanisms.",

    "content": "Results\n\nDescriptive analyses in ALSPAC\n\nThe characteristics of the ALSPAC subjects with both pQCT and genotype data are shown in Table 2. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the five pQCT phenotypes are shown in Table 3. Unsurprisingly, relatively high correlations were observed between many of these traits, reflecting their codependence on cortical bone size. However, weaker associations were observed between PC and CT, and for BMDC, implying that CT, periosteal apposition, and BMDC are at least in part regulated independently.\n\nAssociations in ALSPAC\n\nTable 4 shows the results of association analyses for the nine SNPs in ALSPAC. rs3018362, near the RANK gene, was significantly associated with BMDC (P = 0.001), whereas no association was observed between this marker and any other cortical bone parameter. Each minor allele (A) was associated with a decrease in BMDC of 2.5 mg/cm3, equivalent to a change of 0.07 sd. The association between rs3018362 and BMDC was not attenuated when adjusted for height and weight(ln). No association was observed between other markers within the RANK/RANKL/OPG system and cortical bone measures, with the exception of weak evidence for an association between rs4355801 (within the OPG gene) and BMDC (P = 0.051).\n\nThere was suggestive evidence for association between BMDC and rs2010281 within the MARK3 gene (P = 0.006), whereas no associations were observed between this marker and any other cortical bone parameter. Each minor allele (A) of rs2010281 was associated with an increase in BMDC of 2.1 mg/cm3, equivalent to a change of 0.05 sd. The association between rs2010281 and BMDC was partially attenuated by adjustment for height and weight(ln). There was also suggestive evidence of association between the rs1038304 marker within the ESR1 gene and BMDC (P = 0.048), which showed no attenuation after adjustment for height and weight.\n\nMetaanalyses in ALSPAC and GOOD\n\nWe tested each of the nine SNPs for an association with BMDC in a second male-only sample, GOOD (n = 935) (Table 5). The results for the association (with age as a covariate) are displayed alongside the ALSPAC (model 1, age and sex as covariates) results and the results from the recently published aBMD genome-wide metaanalysis. In the GOOD sample, two SNPs (rs4355801 and rs6993813, r2 = 0.60), which flank the OPG gene, showed some evidence of association with BMDC (P = 0.006 and P = 0.002, respectively). After carrying out metaanalysis of the two samples, rs4355801 showed significant evidence (P = 0.002) and rs6993813 showed suggestive evidence (P = 0.003) for overall association with BMDC. Although in the overall ALSPAC analyses these SNPs showed smaller effects than in the GOOD study, when we restrict the ALSPAC analyses to males only, larger effects are seen (rs4355801 β = 1.816; r6993813 β = 2.200). Although rs3018362 near the RANK gene was associated with BMDC in ALSPAC, a similar association was not observed in GOOD alone; however because the direction of effect was consistent between the two, metaanalyses performed on the two samples did show significant evidence for overall association (P = 0.0004). When analyzing the ALSPAC males alone, the effect size of this SNP is even larger (β = −4.177), suggesting the gender composition of the two cohorts does not explain the discrepancy.\n\nAlthough rs2010281 (MARK3) was suggestively associated with BMDC in ALSPAC (β = 2.122; P = 0.006), a similar association was not seen in GOOD (β = 0.347; P = 0.717), and overall, there was suggestive association (P = 0.009), similar results were seen in ALSPAC when analyzing only the males (β = 2.961; P = 0.016). No association was observed between rs1038304 near the ESR1 gene and BMDC in GOOD, and there was no evidence of an overall association in combined analyses, reflecting the opposing direction of effect in the two cohorts. When analyzing the males alone in ALSPAC, the association with this SNP is even stronger (β = 3.413; P = 0.004), suggesting that the gender composition of the two studies does not explain the discrepancy.\n\nThe results in the GOOD cohort were very similar when height and weight(ln) were included in the models. The metaanalysis results were therefore almost identical to the simpler model apart from for MARK3, where the slight attenuation in the ALSPAC cohort results in the overall metaanalysis P value rising from 0.009 to 0.018. When metaanalyzing male-only data, broadly similar results are seen to those presented in Table 5 apart from the ESR1 P value rising to 0.035.\n\nThe results from the recent large-scale (>19,000 subjects) genome-wide metaanalysis of aBMD include all but one of the SNPs we have studied here. The standardized effect sizes for each alleles association with aBMD are shown in Table 5. Our results were in the same direction for all SNPs except rs2010281 (MARK3).",

Highly significant SNPs at the experiment-wise level (PEW < 10–5) are presented in Fig. 1. We use different shapes (circle and square) and colors (green, red, blue and black) to show different kinds of genetic effects of SNPs. \n\nThe estimated genetic effects (represented by the various colors and shapes in Fig. 1) and heritabilities of two models are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3, revealing the genetic patterns and gene-ethnicity interactions on body weight.   \n\nEstimated heritability of different models\n\nEstimated heritability of the base model (WT) and conditional model (WT|SMK) are presented in Table 1. The total heritability of human body weight in the base model is up to 61.78%, within the range of heritability for human body weight discussed in the previous studies (from 40 to 70%). The heritability is mostly contributed by ethnicity-specific dominance effects ( 18.30%) and ethnicity-specific epistasis effects ( 26.21%:  1.67%,  13.66%,  5.49%,  5.39%). SNP rs2504934 in the SLC22A3 gene has the highest heritability ( 17.93%) in A-A population, and it is the leading result of high heritability of ethnicity-specific dominance effects ( 18.30%). The C/C of rs11684785 × C/T of rs17094894 (TMEM163 × near VRK1) has the highest epistasis heritability ( 20.61%) in E-A population, and it leads to high heritability of ethnicity-specific additive × dominance epistasis effect ( 13.66%) with high significance (PEW -value = 7.43 × 10−5).\n\nThe total heritability of conditional model on smoking ( 66.91%) is higher than that of base model, mostly due to epistasis effects ( 13.86%), and ethnicity-specific epistasis effects ( 33.91%). The highest heritability ( 4.42%) belongs to G/A of rs2504934 in the SLC22A3 gene × T/T of rs620175 in the SDK1 gene. This weight-decreasing epistasis was not detected in the base model, indicating that this epistasis is suppressed by smoking.\n\nGenetic effects of SNPs related to human body weight\n\nThere were 32 highly significant genetic effects (PEW-value < 1 × 10−5) of human body weight detected in the base model (Table 2). Among all the genetic effects, nearly half of them are ethnicity-specific effects, but C-A population has fewer (2/18) ethnicity-specific effects, suggesting that weight-related genes have minor specific effects in Chinese-American.\n\nGenetic effects of SNPs not affected by smoking\n\nWhen removing impacts of smoking in the conditional model, we detected 13 negative effects and eight positive effects of body weight not affected by smoking (Table 2).\n\nThe homozygote genotype of rs9639575 has additive effect ( – 5.12 for T/T and 5.12 for G/G), which reveals that major frequency homozygous (T/T) has negative additive effect, but minor frequency homozygous (G/G) has positive additive effect. The heterozygote genotype T/C of rs11684785 has a positive dominance effect ( 6.26) and three negative epistasis effects with interaction to homozygote genotype T/T and heterozygote genotype T/C of rs620175 ( – 4.02 for T/C × T/T, but 4.02 for T/C × C/C;  – 6.92 for T/C × T/T, but 6.92 for T/C × C/C.  – 7.74).\n\nOne dominance effect and three ethnicity-specific dominance effects of the heterozygote genotype G/A of rs2504934 will increase body weight by 4.22 lb, but decrease body weight by – 7.59 lb in E-A population and – 13.67 in H-A population, increase body weight by 22.27 lb in A-A population, respectively. Interestingly, this SNP not only has the largest positive effect but also the smallest negative effect among all genetic effects with highly significance ( 22.27, PEW-value < 1 × 10−47;  – 13.67, PEW-value < 1 × 10−32). This means SNPs can have totally different effects in different ethnic populations. The homozygote genotype G/G of this SNP also has five different epistasis effects with interaction to rs620175 in the SDK1 gene (additive × additive effect and additive × additive epistasis effects in all four populations, increases body weight in E-A and H-A populations, decreases body weight in C-A and A-A population), indicating that this epistasis regulates body weight through different metabolic networks in different populations and has widespread effects in different populations. These results show that SNP rs2504934 in the SLC22A3 gene has major effects on body weight, and it is not affected by smoking.\n\nGenetic effects of rs620175 in the SDK1 gene have large parts of total effects (11/21).

In addition to single effects ( 8.74 for T/T but – 8.74 for C/C,  – 5.68 for T/T but 5.68 for C/C), SNP rs620175 also has many epistasis effects with interaction to three SNPs (rs11684785 in the TMEM163 gene, rs2504934 in the SLC22A3 gene, and rs1277840 in the CACNB2 gene). Epistasis rs620175 × rs1277840 has positive dominance × dominance effect ( 6.46), while all the effect values of rs11684785 × rs620175 are negative ( – 4.02 for T/C × T/T,  – 7.74,  – 6.92 for T/C × T/T).\n\nGenetic effects of SNPs caused by smoking\n\nEleven highly significant genetic effects were detected due to smoking (Table 2). All five single effects and ethnicity-specific effects in E-A population are positive, but ethnicity-specific effects in other three ethnic populations are negative. This indicates that smoking not only has overall effects of increasing body weight in all populations, but also can increase weight in E-A population and decrease weight in C-A, A-A, and H-A populations.\n\nCompared to effects of SNPs not affected by smoking, genetic effects caused by smoking are smaller. The largest effect is 6.94 with heritability 1.74% of rs17094894 near the VRK1 gene. This shows that effect of smoking on weight-related genes is not so significant as compared to their own effects on body weight. This SNP also has ethnicity-specific additive × dominance epistasis effect with interaction to rs11684785 in the TMEM163 gene in E-A population ( 4.51 for T/C × C/C and – 4.51 for T/C × T/T), indicating that this SNP is a key factor in the mechanism of weight gain contributed by smoking in all populations, but is also a smoking-related factor in the mechanism of weight gain in E-A population.\n\nSNP rs620175 has many additive-related effects, including ethnicity-specific additive effects in A-A population and three epistasis effects with rs2504934, rs9639575, and rs1277840. The only additive effect due to homozygote genotype A/A of rs1415210 in the CRB1 gene is highly significant ( 4.13 for A/A but – 4.13 for T/T, PEW-value < 1 × 10−22), and this SNP also has another effect in E-A population ( – 4.83). SNP rs1277840 is involved in two effects, one single effect ( – 5.11) and one epistasis effect ( 8.34) with interaction to rs620175 in the SDK1 gene.\n\nSNPs suppressed by smoking\n\nThere were seven highly significant SNPs (PEW-value < 1 × 10−5) detected only in the conditional model with 25 genetic effects (Table 3).\n\nSNP rs1467194 could only be detected in the conditional model; whereas SNP rs11684785 could not be detected in this model. However, these two SNPs are located close to each other in the same gene TMEM163. The homozygote genotype of rs1467194 takes part in two epistasis effects: additive × additive effect with interaction to rs9639575 ( – 3.51 for G/G × T/T and A/A × G/G, and 3.51 for G/G × G/G and T/T × A/A), ethnicity-specific additive × additive effect with rs17094894 in E-A population ( 3.45 for G/G × C/C and A/A × T/T, − 3.45 for G/G × A/A and C/C × T/T), and ethnicity-specific additive × dominance effect with rs17094894 in C-A population ( 8.44 for G/G × C/T but – 8.44 for A/A × C/T).\n\nThe dominance × additive effect ( – 11.76 for G/A × T/T but 11.76 for G/A × C/C) of rs2504934 × rs620175 is the negatively largest effect suppressed by smoking with the heritability of 4.42%, which contributes to a large part of the total heritability of epistasis effects in the conditional model. SNP rs2656825 was not detected in the base model, but has highly significant additive effect ( 9.06, PEW-value < 1 × 10−64) in the conditional model. Apart from this single effect, six epistasis effects were detected due to interactions with three SNPs (rs620175, rs1277840 and rs2145965), implying that this SNP is involved in body weight regulation and could be suppressed by smoking.\n\nSmoking also suppresses the ways in which SNPs regulates the body weight via other two important SNPs (rs1415210 and rs2145965).

SNP rs1415210 has epistasis effects with rs17094894 ( – 6.44 for A/A × C/C and T/T × T/T, 6.44 for A/A × T/T and C/C × T/T;  – 9.97 for A/A × C/T but 9.97 for T/T × C/T). The heterozygote genotype G/C of rs2145965 near the KIZ gene has a positive dominance effect ( 6.42) and three negative effects with interaction to rs2656825 ( – 3.17 for A/A × G/C but 3.17 for T/T × G/C,  – 7.77,  – 5.17 for A/A × G/C but 5.17 for T/T × G/C).\n\nGene ontology analysis\n\nUsing BioPubInfo (https://ibi.zju.edu.cn/biopubinfo/), we also assessed the structural and functional connectivity for the detected candidate genes.\n\nFigure 2a shows the network of two SNP-related genes (CREB5 and SLC22A3) not caused or suppressed by smoking. The CREB5 gene is connected to the SLC22A3 gene via three kinds of chemicals (estradiol, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol sulfate), which are all related to estrogen. Gonadal hormones can effectively control body weight, the activation of estradiol will affect the body's homeostasis for a long time in female animals, it has similar effects in humans. \n\nFigure 2b shows three SNP-related genes with the largest effects caused by smoking (CRB1, SDK1, SLC22A3). The SDK1 gene is connected to the CRB1 gene through valproic acid and to the SLC22A3 gene via tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). These two chemicals were both proved to be related to body weight. A common adverse reaction of valproic acid is weight gain. TCDD is a main compound in cigarettes, and animals treated with TCDD will develop overeating and become obese. SNP rs2504934 in the SLC22A3 gene has seven kinds of epistasis effects with interaction to rs620175 in SDK1 gene in all populations (Table 3), indicating that this epistasis is important in body weight regulation, and that these effects may be caused by smoking through TCDD. From gene ontology analysis, the relationship between these three genes became clearer for smoking and body weight.\n\nFigure 2c shows three SNP-related genes (TMEM163, VRK1, SLC22A3) with the largest effects suppressed by smoking. All the three genes are connected to each other by benzopyrene. Long-term exposure to benzopyrene may cause obesity, and overweight/obesity can be experimentally induced by benzopyrene, which is a main compound in cigarettes, and all these three genes have effects contributed or suppressed by smoking. This gene ontology plot proves the reliability of our results in some ways.\n\nFigure 2d shows other three key genes (CACNB2, VRK1, CREB5) that have interesting stories about body weight. The VRK1 and CREB5 genes are connected via 7,8-dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene-9,10-oxide, which is an analogue of benzopyrene. Cyclosporine is connected to genes CACNB2, VRK1 and CREB5. Cyclosporine, which is widely used in organ transplantation, was found to cause weight gain after transplantation. The CREB5 gene and the VRK1 gene are connected through the JUN gene and the ATF2 gene. CRE (cAMP response element) can bind to the product of the CREB5 gene with c-Jun (another name of the JUN gene). The protein encoded by the ATF2 gene is closely related to CRE and c-Jun. An essay clearly described the regulatory principles and the complex metabolic interaction of CRE, c-Jun, the ATF2 gene, and the VRK1 gene. This network may be a way of controlling body weight and the reasons are as follows. CREB (CRE binding protein) and ATF2 could affect the expression of UCP1, a protein essential for the thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue. The brown adipose tissue is related with heat production in human body, and there is a weight loss therapy for the purpose of activating the tissue. Thus, we may have discovered a novel mechanism involving CRE of these four genes that has impacts on body weight and weight-related diseases through a complex metabolic network, the specific reason remained to be revealed.\n\nGene effect prediction\n\nThere were 15 SNP/epistasis detected in the base model and 22 SNP/epistasis detected in the conditional model. All the 15 SNP/epistasis were also detected in the conditional model. The patterns of gene effects for 15 SNP/epistasis in the conditional model are almost identical with those in the base model (some new effects were detected when setting smoking as a covariant, indicating that these effects are suppressed by smoking). This shows the stability and reasonableness of our conditional method. Although some effects of the 15 SNP/epistas",

The patterns of gene effects for 15 SNP/epistasis in the conditional model are almost identical with those in the base model (some new effects were detected when setting smoking as a covariant, indicating that these effects are suppressed by smoking). This shows the stability and reasonableness of our conditional method. Although some effects of the 15 SNP/epistasis were not detected in the conditional model (some effects disappeared when setting smoking as a covariant, indicating that these effects are caused by smoking), these effects have little effects on the population and are not large in number. Therefore, we believed that the overall impact of smoking on body weight is produced by suppressing the expression of certain weight-related SNP/epistasis.\n\nIn Fig. 3, we present genetic effects of the rest seven SNP/epistasis in the conditional model, which are suppressed by smoking. We arranged individuals of same population together, did clustering on the effects in each population, and then visualized the result by R software. \n\nThe most important result of Fig. 3 is that smoking has different effects on different populations. The effects of these seven SNP/epistasis were smaller in effect size and less in effects number compared to other three ethnic populations (represented in Fig. 3 as the region of C-A population has large area of blank or light color), showing that smoking has limited effects on C-A population. However, A-A population has large area of dark color, and the color is the darkest in all effects. From the point of single SNP/epistasis, rs620175 × rs2656825 has negative effects (purple color) on some people in A-A population but not in other populations; rs1277840 × rs2656825 has positive effects (orange color) on some people in H-A population but not in other populations. Some other SNP/epistasis have the same phenomenon.\n\nThe first column is the sum of all columns, from which we can infer when people quit smoking, he or she will gain or lose how much body weight. In E-A and H-A populations, a small number of people will gain weight heavily (people have red color in the first column), but also a small number of people will lose weight heavily (people have blue color in the first column), and major part of people will have slight weight change. In C-A population, smoking cessation has limited effects on body weight, but in A-A population, a majority of people will lose weight when quitting smoking.",

    "content": "Results\n\nAssociations of Sterols with Glucose Levels, Insulin Sensitivity and Insulin Secretion\n\nAfter the exclusion of participants with previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus and participants on statin medication, a total of 746 men were included in statistical analyses. Their mean age was 57.6 years (SD 5.8), BMI 27.1 kg/m2 (SD 3.9), 18.8% of them were current smokers, and 63.8% were physically active (undertaking regular physical exercise at least once a week for ≥30 min). Mean FPG at baseline was 5.6 mmol/l (SD 0.6) and 2hPG 6.1 mmol/l (SD 2.20). Levels of sterols at baseline are given in Table S1.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1 the levels of three absorption markers, campesterol, sitosterol and avenasterol were significantly reduced (P<1×105) as a function of increasing FPG levels, but no significant changes were observed for cholesterol synthesis markers. Desmosterol significantly (P<1×10−5) and lathosterol and cholestenol nominally (P<0.01) increased as a function of increasing 2hPG levels, whereas the levels of absorption markers decreased (campesterol, P<0.01).\n\nThe associations of sterol levels with insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are shown in Table 1. Synthesis markers, of which desmosterol particularly, correlated inversely with Matsuda ISI, and positively with insulin secretion. In contrast, all markers of cholesterol absorption correlated positively with Matsuda ISI, and cholestanol correlated inversely with insulin secretion. Partial correlations of synthesis markers and cholestanol with insulin secretion lost their statistical significance after the adjustment for Matsuda, suggesting that low insulin sensitivity is the primary mechanism explaining the association of sterols indicating cholesterol synthesis with glucose levels. Similarly, the correlations of the three absorption markers, campesterol, sitosterol and avenasterol were also more significant with insulin sensitivity than with insulin secretion.\n\nThe correlations of sterol levels with FPG and 2hPG were considerably weaker than those with insulin sensitivity as shown in Table 2. Synthesis markers did not correlate significantly with FPG levels but campesterol, sitosterol and avenasterol had significant inverse correlations with FPG. These correlations considerably weakened after the adjustment for both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, whereas no major changes were observed when adjusted for insulin secretion only. Results for 2hPG were quite similar with the exception of higher correlations of synthesis markers with 2hPG than with FPG. Adjustment for all confounding factors and additionally for insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion abolished all statistically significant associations. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the association of glucose metabolism with sterols is mainly mediated by low insulin sensitivity.\n\nEffects of Sterol Levels on the Worsening of Hyperglycemia and the Development of Incident Type 2 Diabetes\n\nWe first evaluated in a 5-year follow-up of the METSIM Study the effects of baseline sterol levels as predictors of the worsening of hyperglycemia, defined by a glucose area under the curve (Glucose AUC) in an OGTT (measurement of glucose levels at 0, 30 and 120 min) in 474 individuals without type 2 diabetes at baseline (Table 3). The levels of synthesis markers, cholestenol (P = 6.5×10−4) and desmosterol (P = 1.6×10−4) significantly predicted (P≤0.006) an increase in Glucose AUC after the adjustment for age, BMI, smoking and physical activity. In contrast, absorption markers campesterol, sitosterol and avenasterol significantly predicted a decrease in Glucose AUC at follow-up, after the adjustment for age, BMI, smoking and physical activity. The associations were largely attributable to low insulin sensitivity since additional adjustment for Matsuda ISI weakened all associations (Table 3), and abolished the association of desmosterol and campesterol with Glucose AUC at follow-up. Additional adjustment for insulin secretion, glucose AUC at baseline and total triglycerides did not substantially alter the results.\n\nA cholesterol synthesis marker desmosterol significantly predicted an increase, and absorption markers campesterol and avenasterol predicted a decrease in the risk of incident type 2 diabetes (Table 4). Associations of desmosterol, campesterol and avenasterol with incident type 2 diabetes were abolished after the adjustment for age, BMI, smoking and physical activity.\n\nSNPs Regulating Sterol Levels\n\nWe performed a genome-wide association study of 538,265 SNPs and non-cholesterol sterol levels in the Kuopio cohort of the EUGENE2 study, and a targeted replication of 134 SNPs in the METSIM cohort. Table 5 presents genome-wide significant and Figure 2 nominally significant results (P<0.001) of a meta-analysis of the discovery sample and the replication sample. The three genome-wide significant SNPs were all associated with the cholesterol absorption marker levels, rs4299376 (from P = 4.7×10−15 to P = 4.3×10−19) and rs6544713 (P = 2.5×10−15 to 3.7×10−19, linkage disequilibrium in European populations with rs429976, r2 = 0.99) of ABCG8, and rs6756629 of ABCG5/ABCG8 (from P = 4.8×10−12 to P = 1.8×10−17).

    "content": "Results\n\nIn this study, 446 cases and 379 controls were investigated to explore the association of VDR SNPs and PCa risk. The characteristics of PCa patients and control subjects are shown in Table I. The respective mean age of patients with PCa and control subjects were 65.5±9.18 and 57.7±10.8 years, respectively. A Student’s t-test reveals significant differences in age between the cases and controls (p<0.0001). The mean Gleason score of the PCa was 7.8±0.63. The mean PSA levels were 2.5 ng/ml and 97.2 ng/ml for the controls and cases, respectively (p=0.0002). All nine SNPs rs731236 (TaqI), rs7975232 (ApaI), rs1544410 (BsmI), rs3782905, rs2239185, rs2289179, rs10783218, rs4516035 and rs2853563 were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). Six of the 9 SNPs were found to be associated with PSA level, PCa risk and/or Gleason score (Table II). SNPs rs731236 and rs3782905 were associated with PSA level and PCa risk. SNP rs1544410 was associated with PSA level and Gleason score, while rs2239185 was associated only with Gleason score. Two SNPs, rs2289179 and rs7975232, were associated only with PCa risk.\n\nThe SNPs associated with PSA level are listed in Table III. SNP rs731236 was found to be associated with PSA risk in AA men even after adjusting for age using the codominant (p=0.021), dominant (OR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.29–0.87; p=0.014), recessive (OR=0.41, 95% CI: 0.17–0.95; p=0.045) and the log additive models (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.37–0.84; p=0.005). SNP rs1544410 was also found to be associated with PSA in AA men after adjusting for age using the recessive (OR=0.42, 95% CI: 0.18–0.93; p=0.04) and the log additive models (OR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.42–0.95; p=0.027). Finally, SNP rs3782905 was also found to be significantly associated with PSA risk in our populations after adjusting for age using the codominant (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.15–2.41; p=0.045), dominant (OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.28–0.86; p=0.014), over dominant (OR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.28–0.88; p=0.017) and the log additive models (OR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.37–0.94; p=0.028). After multiple comparisons testing, rs2289179 lost its significant association under the over dominant model.\n\nAdditionally, the association between VDR SNPs and PCa risk was also assessed (Table IV). SNP rs731236, was found to be significantly associated with PCa risk in AA men after adjusting for age using the codominant (OR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.45–1.01; p=0.039 and OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.26–0.95; p=0.39), dominant (OR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.43–0.92; p=0.018) and the log additive models (OR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.52–0.92; p=0.011). SNP rs7975232 was also found to be significantly associated with PCa risk using the recessive model (OR= 1.85, 95% CI: 1.01–3.39; p=0.042). Furthermore, rs3782905 was found to be marginally significant using the dominant model (OR= 0.72, 95% CI: 0.50–1.02; p=0.06), but lost its significance after adjusting for age. Finally, rs2239185 completely lost its significant association when adjusted for age, although the recessive model showed marginal significance after adjusting for age (OR= 1.70, 95% CI: 0.97–3.00; p=0.061).\n\nThe association between VDR SNPs and Gleason score was also determined (Table V). High and low Gleason scores were defined as less advanced “if a case’s Gleason score is <7” and more advanced “if their Gleason score is >7”. SNP rs1544410 was found to be significantly associated with PCa and high Gleason score risk when adjusted for age under the codominant (OR=1.65, 95% CI: 0.59–4.59; p=0.022 and OR=1.92, 95% CI: 0.24–15.00; p=0.022) and the recessive models (OR=1.61, 95% CI: 0.21–12.18; p=0.0071).

Notably, there was an inverse relationship between Gleason score risk alleles and high PSA level, as well as PCa risk alleles.\n\nA haplotype analysis of VDR SNPs revealed several associated haplotypes with PCa risk. Specifically, haplotype analyses of SNPs associated with PCa risk and those not associated with PCa risk were undertaken separately. The haplotype analyses made up of PCa associated risk alleles showed an additive effect with increasing risk alleles (p-trend <0.001) (Table VI). In particular, the greater the number of risk alleles in the haplotype, the greater the risk. Compared to the reference haplotype made up of the non-risk alleles, haplotype 6, made up of 4 risk alleles, showed an odds ratio of 1.82 (95% CI: 1.21–2.76; p=0.008). The haplotype with 3 risk alleles was also associated with PCa risk (OR=l.77, 95% CI: 1.05–2.97; p=0.02). SNPs that were not associated with PCa also underwent haplotype analysis. All of the haplotypes remained not significantly associated with PCa risk, thus indicating no additive or multiplicative effect (Table VII).",

The SNP rs6580639 showed an overall P-value of 0.0269, with significant distortion in males (P = 0.0054). SNP rs10735810 (FokI) exhibited an overall P = 0.0170, whereas rs2238136 (P = 0.0244) had an effect only in females and rs4760648 had significant distortion overall (P = 0.0304) and in females (P = 0.0138).",

In silico analysis facilitated the mapping of six CGIs across VDR. Three were located at experimentally verified VDR promoters: the tissue-specific promoter at exon 1f (CGI 1065); the primary promoter at exons 1a-1d (CGI 1062); and a promoter at exon 9 (CGI 1060; Fig. 1A). To identify the most variably methylated CGI located at promoters, methylation densities of CGIs were analysed using ERMA for seven DNA samples from primary whole blood cells (a male and female from the Venda population, comprising a control and a TB case for each), EBV-transformed B lymphocytes (a CAU male and female) and the monocytic cell line, U937. CGI 1060 was the most variably methylated (mean methylation density 55.3%, CV = 52%), compared to CGI 1065 (mean methylation density 35.3%, CV = 48%) and 1062 (which was largely unmethylated).\n\nBioinformatic annotation of CGI 1060 (Fig. 1B) revealed 17 CpGs and 7 SNPs. The latter comprised of rs7975232 (ApaI), rs4987032, rs731236 (TaqI), rs11574115, rs34189316, rs35435255 and rs2229829. The monomorphic status of 5 SNPs excluding ApaI and TaqI, is probably a result of the small, unrepresentative sample size. Yet, analysis of dbSNP data showed either monomorphism (rs4987032, rs2229829 and rs11574115) or slight variation (rs34189316 and rs35435255) in larger Caucasian and/or African American groups. The existence of CpGs 5 and 6 was found to depend on the specific allele present for rs4987032 (A/G) and rs731236 (TaqI, C/T) respectively. CGI 1060 was positioned 454 bp upstream of the TSS for the non-coding transcript AK024830, of which the promoter, GXP_168256, traverses CpGs 16 and 17. CGI 1060 was selected for further analysis based on its methylation variability and the presence of TB-associated SNPs, ApaI and TaqI.\n\n3.2. Methylation varies based on ethnicity and disease status\n\nWe compared methylation levels of CGI 1060 between populations of European (CAU) and African (YRI) ancestry to study ethnicity-related methylation differences (Fig. 2). Site-specific and regional methylation differences were considered as both may alter gene expression. Mean, site-specific methylation was significantly higher in YRI at CpGs 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13 and 14 and significantly lower at CpGs 4 and 6 as compared to CAU. Suggestive differences in regional methylation between YRI and CAU were observed but not found to be statistically significant (P = 0.07). CpG 6 coincided with TaqI and showed the least methylation of all CpGs in CAU and YRI. The TaqI ‘C’ allele, when present, was always methylated, causing CpG 6 to be methylated distinctly according to genotype: 0% (TT), 50% (TC) or 100% (CC). The interquartile ranges (IQRs) for both populations at CpG 6 was similar but the median and mean were higher in CAU (mean difference, P = 0.05). The IQR for all other CpGs were narrower for YRI than for CAU (Fig. 2). Methylation levels of CGI 1060 were then compared between TB cases and healthy TB contacts from a Venda population to study TB-related methylation variability (Fig. 3). CpG 3 showed higher methylation in controls than TB cases (P = 0.04), while CpGs 7 and 8 showed higher methylation in TB cases than controls (P = 0.01). No difference in regional methylation between TB cases and controls was observed (Fig. 3). Distribution ranges for site-specific and regional methylation were narrower for Venda DNA, extracted from whole blood, than for DNA extracted from EBV-transformed B lymphocytes in the case of YRI and CAU (for example compare boxplot ranges between Fig. 2 and 3).\n\n3.3. Methylation is associated with TaqI genotype at specific sites and globally\n\nTo investigate whether methylation level was influenced by TaqI or by factors independent of TaqI, the Kruskal-Wallis test together with Mann-Whitney U and Bonferroni correction was used to screen for CpGs showing interaction (or lack thereof) of TaqI with ethnicity (Fig. 4) and TaqI with TB status (Fig. 5). Interaction of TaqI with ethnicity is evident when methylation in TT individuals differs significantly from TC/CC individuals in either CAU or YRI but not in both ethnic groups. Similarly, interaction of TaqI with TB status is evident when methylation in TT individuals differs significantly from TC/CC individuals in either TB cases or controls but not in both TB status groups. Interaction of TaqI with ethnicity or TB status is also evident when methylation is significantly different between TT individuals of both ethnic or TB status groups or between TC/CC individuals of both ethnic or",

CpG 8 showed an independent ethnic effect without interaction with TaqI genotype.

The female to male ratio was 1 : 0.89 and 1 : 1.04 for healthy controls and dental caries adolescents, respectively. The mean age of caries-free group and dental caries adolescents was 12.24 ± 0.30 years and 12.20 ± 0.40 years, respectively. The gender and mean age between the two subjects was not significantly different (p value > 0.05). The data of BOP, VM-value, brushing time, and frequency of the two analyzed groups showed no significant difference (p value > 0.05).  Table 2 illustrates the demographic characteristics of the analyzed groups.\n\n Table 3 shows the distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies for Bsm I (rs1544410), Taq I (rs731236), Apa I (rs7975232), and Fok I (rs10735810) SNPs of VDR gene in the two analyzed groups. The results were fitted to a Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p value > 0.49).\n\nSignificant differences were detected in the frequencies of Fok I genotype between the caries group and the caries-free group. In particular, the frequency of Fok I's TT genotype was obviously lower in the caries experience group than that in the controls (9% versus 24.5%, resp.). We also found a lower carriage rate of allele T (57% in the caries group versus 67.5% in the controls, p value = 0.03) and a higher carriage rate of allele C (91% versus 75.5%, p value ≤ 0.001) in the caries group, compared to the caries-free controls. The odds ratio of the carriage of allele C reached 3.281, which showed a strong relationship between allele C of Fok I and caries group (OR > 3). We found that the frequency of allele C was markedly higher, while the frequency of allele T was significantly lower in the caries cases compared to the caries-free controls.\n\nBy contrast, for the other three VDR gene SNPS (Bsm I, Taq I, and Apa I), the genotypes and allele frequencies (G/A, T/C, and C/A, resp.) showed no statistically significant differences between the caries group and the control group.\n\nAll these four SNPs showed strong evidence of recombination when we performed LD analysis on data of caries and caries-free group or caries-free group only. The linkage between Taq I and Bsm I reached an uninformative status, an intermediate state from strong recombination to strong linkage disequilibrium, when LD analysis was carried out on data of caries group only (Figure 1).\n\nHaplotypes of these four SNPs were presented in an order based on the physical location of these four SNPs. The haplotypes TCGT and TAAC showed a significant difference between the cases and controls since their p values were far less than 0.05. But when we put these data into 999-time permutation tests, only haplotype TCGT and SNP Fok I still had significant difference between the cases and controls (Table 4).",

From the 16 articles obtained after reviewing the abstracts, finally 14 appropriate articles were included in this study based on the entry and exit criteria shown in Figure 1. Of the 14 articles selected, 4 studies examined serum levels of vitamin D in affected individuals, 2 studies studied the effect of vitamin D supplementation on OLP symptoms, in 2 studies, the association of VDR gene polymorphisms and OLP risk have been investigated and 6 studies have investigated the mechanisms of OLP formation due to vitamin D deficiency (Table 1).\n\nSerum vitamin D levels\n\nFigure 2 shows the forest diagrams of the meta-analysis. Four studies were included in the meta-analysis. In the OLP and control groups, 206 and 170 patients were studied, respectively. There were 166 patients with OLP and 104 controls with vitamin D less than 30 ng/ml. Heterogeneity between studies was not significant (Q = 5.57, df = 3, I2 = 46.19, p-value = 0.13). According to the results of the meta-analysis, the odds of vitamin D levels in patients with OLP being lower than 30 ng/ml were 2.65 times higher than those in the control group (OR = 2.65.95% CI = 1.20 -5.83, p-value = 0.015).\n\nThe effect of vitamin D supplementation on OLP symptoms\n\n Studies that have evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on OLP showed statistically significant improvement in symptoms of OLP patients receiving vitamin D supplementation.\n\nAssociation of VDR and OLP Gene Polymorphisms\n\nAs a ligand-dependent transcription factor, vitamin D receptors encoded by the VDR gene (chromosomal locus 14-12q12) play important roles in regulating the role of vitamin D. Significant differences in allelic distribution and genotype of VDR FokI polymorphism (rs2228570) between OLP patients and control group indicated the possible importance of VDR FokI polymorphism in susceptibility to OLP. The single nucleotide polymorphisms are rs2239185 and rs7975232 in the intron region of the VDR gene. The GTEX database has shown that the amount of VDR expression in the blood is actually affected by genetic changes. Thus, polymorphisms in VDR genes may affect the expression of blood VDR and decrease the binding of vitamin D to VDR in blood and oral keratinocytes and prevent activation of the VD/VDR pathway. Such anti-inflammatory effects are inhibited and eventually lead to lichen planus. In two studies by Kujundzic et al and Shen et al on the polymorphism of the rs7975232 VDR gene, different results were presented. It is noteworthy that the different results may be due to different ethnic populations and sample sizes.\n\nPathways of creating OLP due to Vitamin D or VDR Deficiency\n\nSchematic illustration of mediatory effect of vitamin D/VDR signaling on prevention of OLP is shown in Figure 3.",

In the case and control group 82.6% and 78% of participants were female, respectively; and the difference was not statistically significant. Also there was no significant difference between the mean ages of case and control groups (34.08 ± 1.01 versus 34.77 ± 1.06, resp.). Patients' characteristics are reported in Table 2.\n\nThe allele frequencies of F and f for the FokI gene in the study population were 356 (87.7%) and 50 (12.3%), respectively. Frequencies in the control group were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The f allele was more frequent in the migraine patients than the control subjects (16.9% versus 7.5%, P = 0.002) (Table 3). For the TaqI gene, frequency of T and t alleles were 318 (78.3%) and 88 (21.7%), respectively. The t allele was more frequent in the case group than the control (25.3% versus 18%, P = 0.035) (Table 3). The frequencies of homozygote and heterozygote genotypes in the study population were 153 (75.4%) and 50 (24.6%) for FokI gene and 115 (56.7%) and 88 (43.3%) for TaqI gene, respectively. The heterozygote genotype was statistically more frequent in the migraine patients than the control subjects for both TaqI (50.4% versus 36%, P = 0.018) and FokI gene polymorphisms (33.9% versus 15%, P = 0.001) (Table 3). Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the independent role of  the FokI gene polymorphism in susceptibility to migraine and adjust the potential effect of TaqI gene polymorphism. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the Ff genotype of the FokI gene in subjects with the Tt genotype of the TaqI gene is associated with a higher risk for the disease compared with the control (OR: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.57–6.33, and P = 0.001).\n\nVDR haplotypes derived from FokI and TaqI polymorphisms were examined using combination of genotypes. Subjects heterozygous for more than one polymorphic site were not considered for haplotype frequency. The distribution of haplotype frequencies in patients and control groups is shown in Table 4. Results show that frequency of TF haplotype in the control group is statistically significant more than the patients, and the haplotypes carrying t or f are more frequent in the patients group (P = 0.012).\n\nThe comparison of allele frequencies between males and females in the case and also control group showed that there is no significant difference in the alleles distribution according to the sex (P = 0.231 and 0.163 for FokI gene and P = 0.469 and 0.494 for TaqI gene, resp.). Further analysis in the migraine subjects showed that the distributions of FokI rs2228570 and TaqI rs731236 gene polymorphisms were not associated with the presence of a family history of migraine and also with presence of menstrual effect on the headache aggravation (P = 0.228 and 0.493 for FokI gene and P = 0.086 and 0.377 for TaqI gene, resp.). Frequency of headache per month and total HIT-6 score between the homozygote and heterozygote patients are shown in Table 5.",

The male/female frequencies were 49 (44.54%)/61 (55.46%) for the case group and 41 (37.27%)/69 (62.73%) for the control group (P = .14). The age of subjects in mean ± SD was 31.34 ± 7.81 and 28.73 ± 6.89 years, for the patient and normal groups, respectively (P = .203). No significant differences were found between groups for sex and age of subjects. The pulmonary function characteristics were measured, and the corresponding values were as follows: FEV1 (%predicted) = 70.04 ± 20.86, FVC = 69.32 ± 19.31 and FEV1/FVC = 71.99 ± 4.75. With regard to asthma severity, 35 patients (36.8%) had mild symptoms, 24 patients (25.3%) showed moderate symptoms, and 36 patients (37.9%) had severe symptoms.\n\nMeasurement of Vit D and VDBP in serum samples\n\nConcentrations of Vit D in the patient and control groups were 16.26 ± 6.76 and 23.05 ± 10.57 ng/mL, respectively. Figure 1A shows that the serum Vit D significantly decreased in asthmatic patients compared to healthy subjects (P = .001). Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was presented in 71.42% of patients, while the corresponding value for the healthy group was 40.32% (P < .0001). The results indicated that decline in Vit D is a risk factor for the progression of asthma (OR = 3.04, 95% CI = 1.32‐7.00, Z statistic = 2.6, P = .0092). Differences of serum Vit D concentration between males and females were not statistically significant, although female subjects had a bit lower Vit D content (P = .19; 21.81 ± 11.4 vs 19.12 ± 8.27 ng/mL). Furthermore, our data did not show a significant association between age of subjects with serum Vit D level (P = .36). On the other hand, serum VDBP concentration increased in patients compared to controls (1044.6 ± 310.82 and 545.95 ± 121.73 µg/mL, respectively), and the difference between groups for VDBP was statistically significant (P < .0001; Figure 1B). Our results also revealed a direct correlation between high level of serum VDBP and development of asthma (Spearman's ρ = 0.61, P = .001).\n\nLinear regression analysis showed that rise in serum Vit D directly linked to higher FEV1% in asthmatic patients (r 2 = .79, P < .0001; Figure 2A). Our results also showed a direct correlation between Vit D with FVC (r 2 = .78, P < .0001) and Vit D with FEV1%/FVC (r 2 = .22, P = .001; Figure 2B,C). Furthermore, determination of serum Vit D based on severity of asthma showed a significant decline of Vit D in cases with severe symptoms compared to mild and moderate symptom groups (Figure 2D). In addition, no significant correlation was found between serum VDBP with clinical outcomes including FEV1%, FVC, FEV1%/FVC, asthma severity, and also the age of studied subjects (data not shown).\n\nGenotype analysis\n\nThe distribution of genotype and allele frequencies for VDR rs1544410, VDR rs2228570, and VDBP rs7041 SNPs in patients with the asthma and control groups is shown in Table 1. All of the studied SNPs including VDR rs1544410, VDR rs2228570, and VDBP rs7041 were consistent with Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium (P > .05).\n\nThe VDR rs1544410 GG genotype was more frequent in patients compared to control, although the difference was not significant (P = .21). Similar results were seen for GA (P = .21) and AA (P = .58) genotypes. The frequency of G and A alleles had no significant differences between patient and healthy subjects (P = .81), although the frequency of G allele was significantly higher in both groups versus the A allele (P < .0001). The clinical properties of studied subjects did not show any significant difference for VDR rs1544410 SNP. However, serum concentration of VDBP has increased in GG genotype compared to heterozygote GA and homozygote AA genotypes (1269.2 ± 737.67, 1026.4 ± 229.82, and 989.96 ± 130.23 µg/mL, respectively) (P = .03; Figure 3A). Similar results were seen for serum VDBP in patients with GG genotype compared to the AA + GA group (P = .001, Table S1).\n\nGenotype analysis of VDR rs2228570 showed the higher prevalence for TT genotype in both cases and controls compared to CC genotype.

Furthermore, analysis of studied groups did not show any correlation between VDR rs2228570 SNP and clinical findings of asthmatic patients.\n\nThe rate of the GG‐rs7041 was increased in the patient group compared to healthy subjects (39.1% vs 20.91%, P = .003). In addition, GG genotype was a potential risk factor for asthma development (OR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.21‐5.5, P = .014). Our data showed that VDBP‐rs7041 has no significant association with clinical findings included serum Vit D, FEV1%, FVC, and FEV1/FVC. However, serum VDBP concentration was observed to be increased in GG genotype compared to TT and TG genotype (974.79 ± 471.62, 816.41 ± 274.03, and 794.58 ± 226.99 µg/mL, respectively) (P = .02, Figure 3B). In addition, the VDBP serum concentration was found to be increased in patients with GG genotype when compared to the TT + TG group (P = .028, Table S1). We also found that the GG‐rs7041 was a potential risk factor for asthma development compared to TT + TG (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.33‐4.42, P = .004; Table S2).",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nTwo hundred and fifty-three families (127 DS with AVSD cases and 126 DS with no CHD controls) were initially enrolled and genotyped for the study. Three case families and four controls families were removed due to failed genotyping of the proband, and three additional case families were dropped due to questionable sample identity. In addition, two control fathers, two control mothers, and one set of case parents were removed due to genotyping failure. As stated in the methods, two analyses of the data were performed; the first included only self-reported white cases and controls. After all quality control checks, this white-only sample consisted of 72 control trios, 78 case trios, 18 parent-control pairs, 10 parent-case pairs, and 4 proband-only control and 4 proband-only case families. The data set in the second analysis was comprised of a combined sample of self-reported white and black families, to determine whether associations in the white-only sample were also supported in the larger dataset and to test whether these findings were consistent with race-independent effects. This combined sample contained 89 control trios, 29 control parent-proband pairs, and 4 control proband-only families, as well as 85 case trios, 28 case parent-proband pairs, and 8 case proband-only families (Table I).\n\nTwenty-three SNPs were genotyped on chromosome 21 in the CBS and SLC19A1 genes. The genotype call rate was comparatively low for these trisomic SNPs compared to non-chromosome 21 SNPs, largely due to the difficulty of distinguishing all four genotype clusters (i.e., AAA, AAB, ABB, and BBB). Five CBS SNP assays failed quality control or did not produce distinguishable heterozygous clusters in trisomic probands. Of the remaining 18 trisomic SNPs, none had more than two Mendelian errors and all were in HWE in the parents.\n\nIn total, 22 SNPs were genotyped in the three non-chromosome 21 genes. Of these 22 SNPs, three failed to genotype on the Illumina platform, including the MTHFR nonsynonymous coding SNP c.1298A>C (rs1801131). Due to its known function and implication in other congenital anomalies, MTHFR c.1298A>C was genotyped separately using the SNPStream platform in the white families; the results are included in this analysis. One SNP was monomorphic in the study sample. No SNPs were significantly out of HWE when tested separately in the parents or probands.\n\nWe previously reported that both sex and race of the proband are significant risk factors for AVSD in infants with DS. Using logistic regression, we independently tested proband sex and race as potential risk factors in this study population. Consistent with our previous observation, females were at significantly increased risk for AVSD (OR 2.52, CI 1.50–4.22), and thus sex was included in all regression-based gene and SNP tests. Although race of the proband, as reported by the mother, was not a significant predictor of AVSD status in this study sample (OR 1.06, CI 0.59–1.91) because cases and controls were matched on race, race was included as a covariate in all analyses of the combined sample including both black and white families.\n\nCHROMOSOME 21 CANDIDATE GENES\n\nGene-level testing of chromosome 21 candidate genes—the reduced folate carrier SLC19A1 and the reducing enzyme of homocysteine CBS—was used to identify genes with increased allele sharing in AVSD cases compared to unaffected controls using all probands and adjusting for sex and race. Cases with AVSD shared significantly more alleles IBS across SLC19A1 than expected (P = 0.01), suggesting an association between variation in this gene and AVSD.\n\nIndividual SNP tests were also consistent with association between variation in SLC19A1 and AVSD. In analysis of whites only, two SNPs (rs3753019 and rs2330183) were nominally associated with AVSD in the trend test (Table IIA); however, the permuted P-values (0.680 and 0.563, respectively) were not significant. Using the genotype test, probands with a genotype at rs2330183 containing at least one C allele were at greater risk of AVSD in the sample of white probands. In combined analysis of white and black cases and controls, the same two SNPs, rs3753019 and rs2330183, as well as two additional SNPs, rs1051298 and rs12482346, reached nominal significance in the trend test, though again permutation-corrected P-values, 0.659, 0.747, 0.588, and 0.613, respectively, were not significant (Table IIB). The results of the genotype test also suggest a specific risk genotype for three of the SNPs (CTT for rs3753019, TTT for rs1051298, and TTT for rs12482346, respectively) (Table IIB).\n\nFor the family-based analyses, only 67 of 85 case families and 80 of 89 control families had chromosome nondisjunction data available. The sample size was further reduced due to relatively low levels of SNP heterozygosity. With this reduced sample, rs2838950 was the only SNP in SLC19A1 significantly associated with AVSD based on the trisomic TDT (Table III). SNP rs2838950 showed no corresponding transmission distortion in control trios (data not shown).\n\nThe consistent association of several tag SNPs within SLC19A1, none of which has a known biological function, is suggest",

SNP rs2838950 showed no corresponding transmission distortion in control trios (data not shown).\n\nThe consistent association of several tag SNPs within SLC19A1, none of which has a known biological function, is suggestive of indirect association with an untested, functional polymorphism. Linkage disequilibrium patterns from the CEPH HapMap pedigrees indicate all significant tag SNPs are, in fact, in strong LD (r2≥0.80) with the untested SNP rs1051266 (Fig. 2) [2003]. SNP rs1051266 is a nonsynonymous variant (c.80A>G) that results in the replacement of a histidine codon (CAC) with an arginine codon (CGC) at amino acid 27 of the SLC19A1 protein (p. H27R). The risk allele associated with AVSD for all significant tag SNPs is found almost exclusively with the c.80G allele of rs1051266 in the CEPH population.\n\nThe gene-specific test of CBS showed no association with DS-associated AVSD (P = 0.87). Individual SNP analyses showed fewer significant P-values than expected by chance, with only two SNPs reaching nominal significance in any of the tests, one in the genotype test (GGT genotype of rs234715; Table IIA) and one in the trisomic TDT (rs706209; Table III). The same association in rs234715 was observed when analyzing the two ethnic groups together (Table IIB).\n\nNON-CHROMOSOME 21 CANDIDATE GENES\n\nThe gene-level test for MTHFR did not show significant levels of allele sharing among individuals affected with AVSD (P = 0.24). In past studies, several nonsynonymous coding variants have been associated with CHD; therefore, SNPs were also tested individually for association with DS-associated AVSD. None of the individual SNPs reached significance in the trend test (Table IV), but the A allele of rs1801131 (c.1298A>C) was over-transmitted in cases (P = 0.05; Tables IV, V). Evaluation of control families for rs1801131 using the TDT allowed discrimination between selection effects and association with AVSD. In contrast to the cases, c.1298A allele was significantly under-transmitted in control families. Using FBAT, which performs a single test of association combining information from both case and control trios, the MTHFR c.1298A allele was significantly associated with AVSD risk under both dominant (P = 0.03) and additive (P = 0.01) models (Table V).\n\nMTR (P = 0.69) and MTRR (P = 0.67) did not exhibit any significant patterns of allele sharing at the gene level among individuals affected with AVSD. No significant associations were detected in SNPs in MTR, using the trend test in either the white-only sample or in the combined analysis of all families (Table IV). The non-synonymous coding variant MTR c.2756G (rs1805087) was over-transmitted in cases (P = 0.04, permuted P = 0.055); however, there was no corresponding distortion in control trios (P = 0.44, permuted P = 1.0). In the combined FBAT test, MTR c.2756G was significantly associated with AVSD only under a recessive model (P = 0.003) (Table V).\n\nAll SNPs were also tested for interaction with the sex and race of the proband. No significant interactions were observed, though the power to detect potential interaction effects is limited given the small sample size.",

The mean age was the highest for subjects with MM (65 ± 10.7 years), followed by subjects with asbestosis (58.7 ± 9.1 years).\n\nThe mean values of pack-years of smoking were the highest in subjects with asbestosis (24.4 ± 18.6) and in subjects with MM (23.2 ± 17.2). Regarding asbestos exposure, the percent of subjects with low asbestos exposure was the highest for the group of subject with no asbestos-related disease (77.5%), followed by the group of subjects with pleural plaques (72.3%) (Table 1).\n\nThe genotype frequencies for all studied genetic polymorphisms are shown in Table 2. Genotype frequencies for all investigated SNPs were concordant with HWE.\n\nIn univariate logistic regression analysis, no association was found between GCLC rs17883901 and GCLM rs41303970 genetic polymorphisms and asbestos-related diseases.\n\nGSTT1 null genotype was associated with the decreased risk for asbestos-related diseases when analysed together (OR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.42–0.95; p = 0.026).

When analysing the association between high and medium vs. low asbestos exposure and MM compared to pleural plaques, the OR was 3.07 (95 % CI = 1.85–5.12; p < 0.001).\n\nIn multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk of GSTT1 null genotype for all asbestos-related diseases together (OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.41–0.94; p = 0.025) and separately for asbestosis (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.27–0.95; p = 0.033) did not change considerably after adjustment for asbestos exposure. Similarly, the risk of GSTT1 null genotype for pleural plaques remained practically unchanged after adjustment for age (OR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.40–0.99; p = 0.046).

The perioperative changes in α-GST concentration are illustrated in (Fig. 1). In individuals with GSTP1 c.313G/G genotype the early postoperative serum α-GST concentration was significantly higher, compared with the preanaesthetic and 24 h postanaesthetic measurements. Changes in α-GST concentrations between patients were evaluated at different time points using repeated measures analysis of variance where p = 0.00004 (Fig. 2).

    "content": "Results and discussion\n\nAll participants in this study were originally included in the Vitamin D intervention (VIDI) study, a randomized clinical trial investigating whether 30 μg compared with 10 μg of daily vitamin D3 supplementation, given from age 2 weeks to 24 months, would be beneficial for Finnish infants (also see Methods). The 25(OH)D concentration at 24 months was chosen to best represent the children’s inherent 25(OH)D concentrations. For the GWA test the 25(OH)D concentration was treated as a continuous variable and the applied linear model was adjusted for randomization group, sex, season and the first 4 principal components. In order to maximize genetic homogeneity in the cohort, we performed an ancestry analysis in which we excluded 22 individuals because they did not cluster close enough to the 99 Finnish reference individuals encompassed within the 1000 genomes project [see Methods].\n\nTwo genome-wide significant loci near the genes GC and CYP2R1\n\nAltogether 928 children participating in the original intervention study were genotyped using Illumina’s Infinium Global Screening Array. Of them, 761 had both genotype data that passed all quality control filters [see Methods] and a 25(OH)D measurement for the 24-month timepoint. Anthropometric, biochemical and skeletal measurements are shown in Table 1. The GWA results showed two strong signals that surpassed the genome-wide significance threshold (p≤5x10-8), one on chromosome 4 and one on chromosome 11 (Fig 1, QQ-plot in S1 Fig). The genomic inflation factor for the association test was 0.997, suggesting a genetically homogenous dataset with few spurious associations. The lead SNP on the chromosome 4 locus, rs1155563 (p = 1.011 x10-11), was a non-imputed SNP in the first intron of the gene GC (Vitamin D binding protein; ENST00000273951.8). For the signal seen on chromosome 11, the lead SNP rs10832310 (p = 4.241 x10-11) was located in intron 12 of the PDE3B gene (Phosphodiesterase 3B; ENST00000282096.4), but also in close proximity to CYP2R1 (Vitamin D 25-hydroxylase; ENST00000334636.5). Both these two loci have in previous GWA studies been shown to associate with serum 25(OH)D but no GWA data exist for children as young as our cohort. We identified in the GWAS catalog 9 separate studies using 25(OH)D concentration as the studied trait (accessed September 2019). These 9 studies reported in total 47 independent SNPs (41 unique SNPs) that were associated with 25(OH)D levels on a genome wide significant level (Fig 2). The two signals identified in our study are located within the two strongest previously known loci for 25(OH)D concentrations, most often mapped to the genes GC and CYP2R1. However, in a pediatric setting, the GWAS catalog only reports one previous GWA-study on 25(OH)D, involving children aged ≥6 years, that has been able to find genome-wide significant loci.\n\nAt 24 months we observed no difference between boys and girls in their overall 25(OH)D level. Further, sex did not have a significant effect on the association strength between either of the two lead SNPs and 25(OH)D (p = 0.15 for rs1155563 and p = 0.1111 for rs10832310)). However, the intervention had a strong effect on 25(OH)D concentrations at 24 months in the 761 analyzed individuals (beta = 30.88, p<2x10-16). Because of this strong effect we wanted to further investigate the randomization group’s contribution. We performed the same association analysis after separating the two groups receiving 10 μg or 30 μg vitamin D daily (denoted Group10 and Group30). The effect allele (C) at the lead SNP on chromosome 4 (rs1155563) appeared to have a larger negative effect on 25(OH)D in Group30 compared to Group10, while the lead SNP on chromosome 11 (rs10832310) showed a similar effect size regardless of the randomization group (Fig 3). However, no significant interaction effects between the lead SNPs and the randomization group were observed (rs1155563: beta = -3:12, p = 0.259; rs10832310: beta = 0.1987, p = 0.930). Exclusion of the randomization group from the model weakened the association with 25(OH)D for the chromosome 11 lead SNP (p = 1.37−09 vs p = 4.24−11), which was expected. However, for the chromosome 4 lead SNP (rs1155563) we now saw a larger difference in mean 25(OH)D between the genotypes and the association became stronger (p = 2.16−13 vs p = 1.01−11). This was unexpected, because the randomization group should be considered as a competing exposure variable, not a confounder, and exclusion of such a variable should weaken the model. The observed strengthening of the association suggested that a part of the signal on chromosome 4 may be explained by the intervention effect, meaning that children carrying the allele associated with low 25(OH)D respond less efficiently to vitamin D supplementation.\n\nThis observation motivated us to further evaluate how the genotypes affected the response to vitamin D intervention during the controlled trial",

    "content": "the randomization group should be considered as a competing exposure variable, not a confounder, and exclusion of such a variable should weaken the model. The observed strengthening of the association suggested that a part of the signal on chromosome 4 may be explained by the intervention effect, meaning that children carrying the allele associated with low 25(OH)D respond less efficiently to vitamin D supplementation.\n\nThis observation motivated us to further evaluate how the genotypes affected the response to vitamin D intervention during the controlled trial. We constructed a random intercept linear mixed model using the lme4 R package. The 25(OH)D concentrations at two time points, (1) at birth (umbilical cord) and (2) at 24 months, were used as outcome. The model was adjusted for sex and the mother’s 25(OH)D concentration during pregnancy, which impacts cord blood 25(OH)D, (data available for 648 mothers). Since no subjects had received any vitamin D supplementation at the first time point (birth), the interaction effect between genotype and time was assessed separately in the two randomization groups. A significant interaction effect between genotype and time was only seen in the intervention group (Group30) for the lead SNP on chromosome 4 (rs1155563, p = 0.02798, interaction effect: genotype:time: -7.40596). These findings imply that the effect allele (C) of rs1155563, associated with low 25(OH)D, also reduces response to high dose vitamin D supplementation (S1 Appendix).\n\nGC and CYP2R1 are likely to cause the observed association signals\n\nAll SNPs in a 5 Mb window around the lead SNP in each locus were re-imputed from non-phased genotypes to increase imputation precision, as recommended by IMPUTE2. Conditioning on the respective lead SNP in both loci completely suppressed the association signals, implying presence of only one independent signal per loci. Fig 4 shows the two associated loci with the top SNPs in relation to the nearby genes. Using a 100 kb window on both sides of the lead SNPs as the presumed resolution, the most likely gene to give the signal on chromosome 4 is the GC gene, encoding vitamin D binding protein. Intestinal absorption of vitamin D is inadequately characterized, but the process is no longer thought to be only passive. Vitamin D binding protein is highly expressed in the stomach, duodenum and gallbladder, suggesting a role in dietary vitamin D absorption. The protein also has a key role in maintaining 25(OH)D concentrations by mediating its reabsorption in the kidneys. Henderson et al. described recently an adult female with severe vitamin D deficiency due to a homozygous GC gene deletion. The patient was also resistant to treatment and despite very large doses of vitamin D supplementation her 25(OH)D was unmeasurable. Vitamin D binding protein may thus play an important role when handling large quantities of oral vitamin D intake, and SNPs affecting its regulation or function could influence the efficiency of this process.\n\nRegarding the signal on chromosome 11, both PDE3B and CYP2R1 lie within this target window. Since CYP2R1 encodes vitamin D 25-hydroxylase that converts cholecalciferol to 25(OH)D, it can be considered the most likely candidate for the signal. Genetic variation in CYP2R1 is also known to affect 25(OH)D concentrations, and a rare functional variant (p.Leu99Pro) has been shown to significantly lower 25(OH)D concentrations. The applied 100 kb window is based on studies by Wu et al. who recently quantified the mapping precision of associated SNPs in genome-wide association studies. They showed that the distance between the causal variant and the top associated GWAS SNPs most often is shorter than 25.1 Kb and almost always (≈95%) shorter than 100 Kb if the top associated SNPs are common (MAF≥0.01). Their conclusion derived from extensive simulations on whole-genome sequencing data from 3642 unrelated individuals from the UK10K project. We therefore consider the rationale for using a 100 Kb window to search for underlying causes to be strong, but we also acknowledge that the distance relationship between a causal variant and the causal effector gene can vary widely.\n\nComparing association signals with gene expression data\n\nIn an effort to more confidently map the association signals to specific genes we compared the top 10 associated SNPs, and all non-imputed SNPs that passed the genome-wide significance level for each locus, with the full GTEx dataset (V7) with eQTL data for more than 10 000 samples in 53 different tissues. For the loci on chromosome 4, two SNPs (the lead SNP and the third highest ranked SNP) were significantly associated with an expression change in the gene GC for the tissue ‘Stomach’. No other significant associations were seen for any other gene or tissue. For the chromosome 11 locus, 10 of the top-ranking SNPs were significantly associated with an expression change altogether in 5 genes in 9 different tissues. These 10 top-ranking SNPs had a common denominator, they were all significantly associated with the expression level in 3 genes: CYP2R1 (in Thyroid), PDE3B (in Pancreas) and RRAS2 (Tibial Nerve). This common denominator became our focus for further analysis. We extracted all variants included in the GTEx dataset within the 200 kb target window on chromosome 4 for the tissue ‘Stomach’, and on chromosome 11, for the tissues ‘Thyroid’, ‘Pancreas’ and ‘Tibial Nerve’. Because the analysis was limited to the target windows we readjusted the significance threshold",

We extracted all variants included in the GTEx dataset within the 200 kb target window on chromosome 4 for the tissue ‘Stomach’, and on chromosome 11, for the tissues ‘Thyroid’, ‘Pancreas’ and ‘Tibial Nerve’. Because the analysis was limited to the target windows we readjusted the significance threshold, after intersecting the two datasets, to a false discovery rate (FDR) ≤0.05 [See Methods]. Finally, we made a comparison analysis to look for intersecting significant variants in our association test and the GTEx dataset.\n\nFor the 200 kb target window on chromosome 4, our dataset included 237 variants significantly associated with 25(OH)D concentrations (FDR≤0.05). For the same window there were 107 variants in the GTEx dataset (tissue: Stomach) significantly associated with any gene expression changes; 91 of these variants, all associated to a gene expression change in the GC gene, intersected in the two datasets, meaning that they were simultaneously associated with GC gene expression levels and 25(OH)D. Of the 91 variants, 73 variants (80%) were significantly associated with both a lower expression of GC in the GTEx dataset and low 25(OH)D in our study. The remaining 18 variants (20%) were significantly associated with both higher expression of GC in GTEx dataset and high 25(OH)D in our study (Fig 5A). In an attempt to quantify the signal similarities between our dataset and the GTEx dataset we used a bayes factor colocalization analysis from the R package “coloc”. This method approximates the posterior probability that a shared variant is the underlying cause of both signals. The analysis was performed on the 91 intersecting variants significantly associated to 25(OH)D and GC gene expression, and the results show a posterior probability of 32.8% that the same single variant is causing the association signals in both datasets (S1 Appendix). A caveat is that the method assumes one single causal variant for each trait and the precision of the method is also dependent on the number of significant SNPs used as input. However, together with what is known, these results do suggest that the signal we observed on chromosome 4 can be confidentially mapped to the GC gene. The tissue ‘Stomach’ was regarded relevant because of GC’s high expression in the stomach and because Vitamin D binding protein mediates the transport of 25(OH)D from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver and other tissues.\n\nFor the target window in the chromosome 11 locus, the results were not as unequivocal. In the tissue ‘Thyroid’, 52 intersecting SNPs were present. Twenty-seven variants (52%) were simultaneously associated with high CYP2R1 expression and with low 25(OH)D, whereas the other 25 variants (48%) associated with low CYP2R1 expression and high 25(OH)D (Fig 5B). For CYP2R1 these results were opposite to what was expected since we anticipated higher levels of CYP2R1 to associate with higher 25(OH)D concentration. The biological relevance of 25(OH)D in the Thyroid can also be questioned. However, the complete concordance in the direction of association does further implicate CYP2R1 as the gene responsible for the association signal in chromosome 11, also because of its definite role in vitamin D metabolism. Regarding the genes PDE3B (tissue: Pancreas) and RRAS2 (tissue: Tibial Nerve), residing in close proximity to the same locus but lacking a clear role in vitamin D metabolism, we again observed a complete concordance in the direction of SNPs’ association with 25(OH)D levels in our study and gene expression in the GTEx dataset (S2 Fig). SNPs associated with 25(OH)D levels within the chromosome 11 locus thus seem to affect the expression of several genes in different tissues, but in a concordant manner relative to 25(OH)D levels. Performing the same colocalization analysis as above for the chromosome 11 locus, the results show strong support for colocalization of the signals in our study and the GTEx dataset. The posterior probability for a shared causal variant was 97.3% for the intersecting SNPs significantly associated to 25(OH)D and CYP2R1 expression. For the genes PDE3B and RRAS the results also show a high probability for a shared cause of the signals. The significance of these observations remains unclear, but suggests a more complex co-regulation at the chromosome 11 locus. Although we cannot separate CYP2R1 from PDE3B and RRAS2 using the results from the eQTL comparison analysis, our data together with previously published studies collectively suggest that CYP2R1 is the gene behind the observed GWA signal for 25(OH)D in the chromosome 11 locus.\n\nIn the search for underlying causal variants\n\nFrom the eQTL comparison analysis we observed that all analyzed SNPs could be divided into two groups. Within each group all SNPs had the same association direction over the two datasets (our study and GTEx), but the association direction was opposite between the two groups of SNPs. Looking at linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns we observed that SNPs were in higher linkage disequilibrium within their group than with SNPs belonging to the other group. We therefore explored the idea that single underlying genetic variants are driving the observed signals. We functionally annotated all common variants (MAF≥0.05) in both loci within the 200 kb target",

Looking at linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns we observed that SNPs were in higher linkage disequilibrium within their group than with SNPs belonging to the other group. We therefore explored the idea that single underlying genetic variants are driving the observed signals. We functionally annotated all common variants (MAF≥0.05) in both loci within the 200 kb target window and focused on exonic and splice site variants in high LD (r2≥0.6) with the lead SNPs (S1 Table).\n\nFor the locus on chromosome 4, one missense variant (rs4588, p.Thr436Lys, p = 1.503−10, rank = 4th), in high LD with the lead SNP (r2 = 0.68, D’ = 0.82), was seen in GC. Of the 475 other variants within the target window, one other protein altering variant in GC was seen (rs7041, p.Asp432Glu, p = 2.252−08, rank = 16th), but it was in weaker LD (r2 = 0.38, D’ = 0.88) with the lead SNP. Both these variants have previously been shown to impair vitamin D binding protein function and affect 25(OH)D levels. However, taking advantage of the observed LD differences, we could analyze these 2 SNPs separately by fixing the genotype for the lead SNP (rs1155563) at the major allele (T/T). In this sub-analysis neither rs7041 nor rs4588 were associated with 25(OH)D levels and thus are unlikely to be the drivers of the observed signal (S1 Appendix).\n\nFor the locus on chromosome 11, none of the 224 variants within the target window had a protein altering effect, and hence we have no obvious candidate for an underlying cause. To further explore possible candidate causal variants, we also annotated all common variants (MAF≥0.05) for the same 200 Kbp windows in both loci from publicly available whole genome sequences from 1747 Finnish individuals included in the gnomAD database. Taking advantage of sequencing data made it possible to assess multiallelic sites and variants hard to impute. However, no additional variants with probable protein altering capacity were identified.\n\nIdentifying the major haplotypes and their effects\n\nUsing the non-imputed data with high genotyping frequency and the most confident genotype calls we identified the major haplotypes for the two loci using Haploview [Methods]. This was an effort to capture an underlying cause without prior assumptions. Because of relatively high frequency, in both loci, of the haplotypes that included the markers associated with low 25(OH)D, we could also assess combinatory effects of these risk haplotypes under a simplified additive model. The study subjects were genetically stratified into three groups based on the individual haplotype set (Fig 6). Only individuals matching one of the three haplotype sets shown in Fig 6B were assessed in the analysis (total of 228 individuals). The results showed that the effect on 25(OH)D concentrations for the combination of risk haplotypes was additive, approximately doubling the effect. The effect on 25(OH)D concentrations was also larger than the effect seen by looking only at combinatory effects of the lead SNPs in the two loci (beta = -20.781 vs -17.736; std beta = -0.368 vs -0.323). This suggests that the haplotypes tag more of the relevant genomic information than the lead SNPs alone.\n\nAssociating vitamin D risk haplotypes to tibial pQCT measurements\n\nWe observed that 25(OH)D concentration was positively, and significantly, associated with several pQCT parameters (Table 2). Similarly, the effect alleles for both lead SNPs associated negatively with several pQCT parameters, but these associations were not statistically significant. These results suggested a relationship between 25(OH)D concentrations and pQCT parameters at 24 months. Taking advantage of the more powerful haplotype analysis (Fig 6), the results show that the haplotype combinations associating with low 25(OH)D concentrations were also strongly, and negatively, associated with several pQCT parameters (Fig 7). Comparing the association direction for ‘low 25(OH)D haplotypes’ and overall 25(OH)D concentrations, we observed the direction to be opposite for all 6 pQCT parameters (Table 2). By using this single sample Mendelian randomization approach, we can provide support for vertical pleiotropy, meaning that the concentration of 25(OH)D is not only a marker for skeletal outcomes but a mediator of the actual effect (Fig 7B). The results show that low 25(OH)D has a negative impact on bone in 24-month-old children. The results were not dependent on the 4 individuals harboring the rarest haplotype (aabb); the results remained unchanged when these individuals were omitted (S2 Table)”. The applied linear regression model was adjusted for sex, randomization group, length, length-adjusted weight and the manually assessed quality of the scan. This finding is noteworthy because most randomized clinical trials and other Mendelian randomization studies have not been able to find evidence for a causal relationship between bone mineral density and 25(OH)D. The discordant results may relate to the young age in our study cohort, but more studies in a pediatric setting are needed to be able to draw conclusions of the age dynamics of vitamin D metabolism.\n\nStudy limitations\n\nWe have shown that our study has several strengths,",

The discordant results may relate to the young age in our study cohort, but more studies in a pediatric setting are needed to be able to draw conclusions of the age dynamics of vitamin D metabolism.\n\nStudy limitations\n\nWe have shown that our study has several strengths, especially when it comes to the homogeneity of the study cohort and careful collection of the patient data, including skeletal outcomes. This extensive collection of patient data also made it possible to interpret our findings in the context of skeletal outcomes. The intervention setting allowed us to evaluate also the effects of genetic factors on response to supplementation. However, our study also has some limitations. The cohort was underpowered in size for a genome-wide approach and can only detect genotypes that have a large effect on 25(OH)D concentrations, while loci with a more moderate effect remain undetectable. Furthermore, a replication cohort was not available to us for corroborating our results. However, despite the relatively small cohort we were able to find significant associations, further underscoring the significance of the identified genetic variants and loci. The study setting was not ideal when trying to associate genetic variation to 25(OH)D concentrations and assessing response to supplementation, because the entire cohort received vitamin D supplements in two different doses. However, due to the country’s northern location and current national vitamin D guidelines it would not be ethically possible to include a placebo group in a randomized vitamin D study in this age group. Functional experiments were not within the scope of this study and we can therefore only provide support for our findings from post hoc analyses.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this GWA study–the first of its kind in this age group—involving 761 Finnish infants we have identified two loci that strongly associate with 25(OH) Vitamin D concentrations in 24-month-old children. We also showed that the locus on chromosome 4, within the GC gene, seems to affect response to supplementation. We were not able to find any convincing single underlying causative variant in either locus, instead we focused on the effects seen from sets of variants within the same haplotypes. We could show that these sets of variants within the two loci not only associated with 25(OH)D concentrations but were also associated with pQCT-derived parameters of bone strength in 24-month-old children. Because the overall 25(OH)D concentration also was associated with pQCT-derived parameters in a coherent manner, the results suggest that the haplotypes’ effect on bone are, at least partly, mediated by 25(OH)D.",

The median VDBP level was 250 μg/mL (IQR: 175–311 μg/mL) and the median total 25(OH)D level was 27.3 ng/mL (IQR: 20.4–33.0 ng/mL), and both were modestly correlated (r = 0.12; P < 0.01; Supplementary Table S2). The median bioavailable 25(OH)D level was 3.36 ng/mL (IQR: 2.26–4.66 ng/mL). As expected, bioavailable 25(OH)D levels were positively correlated with total 25(OH)D (r = 0.59; P < 0.0001) and albumin levels (r = 0.23; P < 0.0001) and negatively correlated with VDBP levels (r = −0.67; P < 0.0001). The median free 25(OH)D level was 8.25 pg/mL (IQR, 5.66–11.19 pg/mL), and was nearly perfectly correlated with bioavailable 25(OH)D levels (r = 0.99; P < 0.0001); thus, we focused our analyses on bioavailable 25(OH)D that was much more abundant in the circulation.\n\nPatient characteristics were well balanced by quartile of VDBP, except that patients with higher VDBP levels had a lower BMI (Table 1). Patients with higher total 25(OH)D levels had a lower BMI and higher physical activity, compared to those with lower levels (Supplementary Table S3). In addition, patients with higher total or bioavailable 25(OH)D levels were more likely to have their blood collected in the summer or fall.\n\nCauses of death\n\nThe median time of follow-up among patients who were alive at the end of follow-up was 12.4 years (IQR: 8.0–15.3 years). During the follow-up, we documented 328 deaths, 187 (57.0%) of which were due to CRC. Non-CRC causes of death included other malignancies (n = 26), cardiovascular disease (n = 33), neurological disorders (n = 21), cerebrovascular disease (n = 13), respiratory disease (n = 12), and other or unknown reasons (n = 36). A summary of causes of death by follow-up period after diagnosis is presented in Supplementary Table S4. Of the 187 deaths due to CRC, 163 (87.2%) occurred within the first 5 years after diagnosis.\n\nAssociation between prediagnostic VDBP levels and patient survival\n\nHigher VDBP levels were significantly associated with improved overall (Ptrend = 0.001) and CRC-specific survival (Ptrend = 0.02) (Table 2). Compared to patients in the lowest quartile, those in the highest quartile of VDBP had a multivariable HR of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.41–0.80) for overall mortality and 0.58 (95% CI, 0.37–0.91) for CRC-specific mortality. The HRs were not materially changed after further adjustment for total 25(OH)D levels. In addition, higher VDBP levels were associated with improved 5-year overall survival (Ptrend = 0.001), with a multivariable HR of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.32–0.76) comparing extreme quartiles.\n\nTo further address concerns about the possible influence of occult cancer on VDBP levels, we performed sensitivity analyses by excluding patients who developed CRC within 3, 4, and 5 years after blood collection, respectively. Although statistical power was diminished, the association between VDBP levels and patient survival remained largely unchanged (Table 3).\n\nWe next evaluated the associations between 2 VDBP polymorphisms and patient survival. Neither rs7041 nor rs4588 was significantly associated with overall or CRC-specific survival (P ≥ 0.08; Supplementary Table S5). In models additionally adjusted for these polymorphisms, the significant association between VDBP levels and patient survival remained unchanged (Ptrend = 0.001 and 0.008 for overall and CRC-specific mortality, respectively).\n\nThe association of VDBP levels with overall and CRC-specific survival was examined across strata of potential effect modifiers, including age at diagnosis, time from blood collection to diagnosis, sex, BMI, physical activity, cancer stage, grade of tumor differentiation, location of primary tumor, year of diagnosis, and total 25(OH)D levels, and remained largely unchanged in most subgroups (Pinteraction ≥ 0.18; Fig. 1).\n\nAssociations between prediagnostic levels of total, bioavailable, and free 25(OH)D and patient survival\n\nTotal 25(OH)D levels were not significantly associated with overall (Ptrend = 0.09) or CRC-specific survival (Ptrend = 0.08) (Table 4). However, higher total 25(OH)D levels were associated with improved 5-year overall survival (Ptrend = 0.01), with a multivariable HR of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.30–0.78) comparing the highest to the lowest quartile.

Overall, the median (interquartile range, IQR) of age was 67 (59, 77) years, among whom 64% were male. The median (IQR) of dialysis vintage was 4.9 (2.5, 8.1) years. Baseline serum hepcidin-25 and 25(OH)D showed right-skewed distributions and were median 21.6 (5.4, 43.6) ng/mL and 10.9 (8.3, 13.9) ng/mL, respectively. The combined cholecalciferol vs. placebo groups were well-balanced at baseline except for serum 25(OH)D levels and the prevalence of calcium carbonate use, both of which were lower in the cholecalciferol group (P = 0.01 and 0.05, respectively) (Table 1). Supplementary Table S1 online shows baseline characteristics across 3 groups (i.e., thrice-weekly cholecalciferol, once-monthly cholecalciferol, and placebo).\n\nSafety\n\nOut of 96 participants, 4 patients in the placebo group and 5 patients in the cholecalciferol group dropped out and became unavailable for analyses due to adverse events; 1 sudden death, 1 acute cholangitis, and 1 bullous pemphigoid in the placebo group, and 1 congestive heart failure and 1 traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage in the cholecalciferol group (Fig. 1). The other adverse events were 1 infection episode and 1 small bowel obstruction in the placebo group and 2 infection episodes, 1 atherosclerosis obliterans, 1 spinal compression fracture, and 1 bladder cancer in the cholecalciferol group. No patients developed hypercalcemia (≥ 10.5 mg/dL) during the follow-up period.\n\nEffect of cholecalciferol on serum 25(OH)D\n\nMedian (IQR) serum 25(OH)D levels at Day 3 were 13.5 (9.0, 15.4) ng/mL, 12.1 (9.7, 14.6) ng/mL, and 15.2 (12.7, 18.8) ng/mL in the placebo, thrice-weekly cholecalciferol, and once-monthly cholecalciferol group, respectively. At Month 3 and 6, there was no significant difference between thrice-weekly vs. once-monthly cholecalciferol groups (P = 0.19 and 0.40, respectively), and both groups showed higher serum 25(OH)D levels than the placebo group (P < 0.001). Median (IQR) serum 25(OH)D levels at Month 3 and 6 were 12.9 (10.6, 16.6) ng/mL and 13.2 (12.2, 16.0) ng/mL in the placebo group, respectively, and were 23.9 (19.5, 28.3) ng/mL and 23.2 (20.4, 28.9) ng/mL in the combined cholecalciferol group, respectively (Fig. 2a).\n\nEffects of cholecalciferol on serum hepcidin, ESA resistance, and inflammatory markers\n\nAmong 69 darbepoetin users at baseline, 38 and 31 patients were given darbepoetin at the first and second dialysis session of the week (i.e., Monday/Tuesday and Wednesday/Thursday), respectively. During the follow-up, 2 and 3 patients in the placebo group converted ESA from darbepoetin to epoetin-α between Day 3 and Month 3 and between Month 3 and Month 6, respectively, and so did 2 and 2 patients in the cholecalciferol group. One patient in the placebo group converted ESA from epoetin-α to darbepoetin between Day 3 and Month 3. Table 2 shows median (IQR) weekly darbepoetin-equivalent doses at baseline, Month 3, and Month 6 in each group. Change in weekly darbepoetin-equivalent dose from baseline to Month 6 was − 1.3 (− 10.0, 0.0) μg in the placebo group and 0.0 (− 7.5, 10.0) μg in the cholecalciferol group (P = 0.15).\n\nMedian (IQR) hepcidin levels at baseline were 21.6 (5.4, 43.6) ng/mL overall, but were largely different depending on the ESA type.

Patients on thrice-weekly epoetin-α/β showed the highest hepcidin levels [median 43.1 (IQR 21.0, 60.6) ng/mL], followed by those on Wednesday/Thursday once-weekly darbepoetin [median 15.7 (IQR 9.1, 39.3) ng/mL] and Monday/Tuesday once-weekly darbepoetin [median 7.0 (IQR 0.6, 34.3) ng/mL]. No significant difference was observed between darbepoetin schedules.\n\nMedian (IQR) hepcidin levels of each group over the study period were shown in Fig. 2b and Table 2. After adjustment for baseline values, serum hepcidin levels at Day 3 were higher in the combined cholecalciferol than in the placebo group (P = 0.004), which was attenuated at Month 3 (P = 0.65). These findings were not significantly different between the thrice-weekly vs. once-monthly groups (P = 0.30 and 0.50, respectively), and were not significantly modified by age, gender, diabetes, ESA group (i.e., Monday/Tuesday darbepoetin, Wednesday/Thursday darbepoetin, and thrice-weekly epoetin-α/β), and baseline levels of 25(OH)D, hepcidin, ESA resistance index (Supplementary Fig. S1 online; Pinteraction > 0.05 for all).\n\nHowever, the cholecalciferol group showed lower serum hepcidin levels with greater ESA resistance index at Month 6 (Table 2). There were no significant between-group differences in haemoglobin, TNF-α, IL-6, iron saturation, or ferritin at any time point.\n\nEffects of cholecalciferol on serum 1,25(OH)2D and CKD-MBD parameters\n\nSerum 1,25(OH)2D levels were higher in cholecalciferol group than the placebo group at Month 3 and 6 (Table 3 and Fig. 3a). The cholecalciferol group also more frequently reduced the dose of active vitamin D drugs from baseline to Month 6 (P = 0.02) (Fig. 3b). There were no significant between-group differences in serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, intact PTH, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, or bone-specific ALP (Table 3). The multivariable fractional polynomials interaction analysis indicated that cholecalciferol supplementation decreased intact PTH at Month 3 to a greater extent with lower baseline serum 25(OH)D levels only if patients had baseline serum 25(OH)D levels < 8 ng/mL (Fig. 4).\n\nImpact of vitamin D-related gene variants on serum 25(OH)D levels and the effect of cholecalciferol\n\nTable 4 shows the prevalence and baseline serum 25(OH)D levels per SNPs on those selected vitamin D-related genes among 89 (93%) patients who provided informed consent to this genetic study. The T allele at VDR gene rs11568820 was associated with higher baseline serum 25(OH)D levels, while those alleles in the other candidate variants did not show significant association. However, none of the genetic variants significantly modified the effect of cholecalciferol on serum hepcidin level at Day 3, serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D levels at Month 3, and ESA resistance index at Month 6 (Ptrend for interaction > 0.05 for all).",

Results\n\nBioinformatic analysis of the sequencing results was carried out in 46 subjects with a concentration of 25(OH)D below 10 ng/mL (mean concentration 7.13 ng/mL ± 2.16 ng/mL) and in 43 subjects with the normal concentration of 25(OH)D (mean concentration 43.40 ng/mL ± 8.63 ng/mL). Biochemical and anthropometric parameters, as well as data related to lifestyle, are presented in Table 1.\n\nA total of 159 mutations were found in the 3 investigated fragments of the CYP2R1 gene among the 89 participants. 44 mutations occurred in fragment 1, 30 in fragment 2, and 85 in fragment 3. After evaluating these variants with GeneStudioTM Pro 2.2.0.0. software (GeneStudio Inc., Suwanee, GA, USA), the number of detected changes was narrowed down to only two substitutions (Figure 1). These occurred in 10 patients, with 1 variant being found in 9 patients and both variants in 1 patient. Eight of the 10 participants who had 1 mutation were from the group with vitamin D deficiency, and the remaining 2 were from the control group.\n\nThe predicted effect of these amino acid substitutions on the structure and function of CYP2R1 was analyzed using SIFT and PolyPhen prediction tools. Additionally, the potential for acquiring or losing alternative splicing sites was verified by SpliceAI. The first detected variant, NC_000011.10:g.14878291G>A (c.1337G>A), is a missense mutation that probably impairs (or damages) the structure and function of the protein—the value of the PolyPhen score analysis was 1.0, and for SIFT, it was 0.0. This variant led to a replacement of arginine (Arg) with lysine (Lys) at codon 446 (p.Arg446Lys) and was detected in 3 subjects with a 25(OH)D concentration below 10 ng/mL and in 2 persons from the control group (Figure 2). The result of the SpliceAI analysis (DS score = 0.25 (6 bp)) suggests that this variant may have lost a splicing acceptor site (Table 2), and additionally, it should be noted that Arg446 is one of the heme-binding sites. This variant has not been reported in individuals with CYP2R1-related or other conditions, nor in population databases (no frequency in ExAC); however, in the dbSNP database, another variant can be found at this position (rs1555010445->GT, ExAC 0.000%). Bioinformatic algorithms designed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2) suggest that this variant may be impairing; however, this prediction has not yet been confirmed in published functional studies.\n\nThe second detected variant (NC_000011.10: g.14878336T>G (c.1331-39T>G) is an intron variant and was identified in 5 subjects with a concentration of 25(OH)D below 10 ng/mL and in 1 person with a concentration above 30 ng/mL (Figure 2). SpliceAI analysis did not show any significant effect on alternative splicing (Table 2). This variant is not present in population databases (no frequency in ExAC) and has not been reported in the literature in individuals with CYP2R1-related or other conditions.",

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 2. Participants were examined in terms of VDR and VDBP polymorphisms. Most of the kidney recipients were treated by a triple immunosuppression therapy including corticosteroids (prednisolone), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and Tacrolimus that was tailored based on measured plasma levels.\n\n3.1. Frequencies of VDR and VDBP Alleles and Genotypes Distribution\n\nThe frequency of alleles and genotypes distribution in ApaI (rs7975232) are shown in Figure 2A,B. The results showed that the G allele frequency in rs7975232 polymorphism in the control group was significantly 0.63 times more than that of the case group (p = 0.026). There were differences between the two groups concerning the distribution of TT, GG, and GT genotypes of rs7975232; however, they were not statistically noteworthy (p = 0.058). Comparing the case and control group, concerning the frequency of FokI (rs2228570) G and T alleles (p = 0.234), no significant difference was observed (Figure 2C). Furthermore, the frequency of rs2228570 genotypes (GG, GT, and TT) was not statistically significant between the groups (p = 0.629) (Figure 2D). Similarly, no significant differences were detected between the frequency of T and C alleles (p = 0.710) and that of CC, CT, and TT genotypes (p = 0.819) of the Bsml genotype (rs1544410) between the two groups (Figure 3A,B). Furthermore, no significant difference was detected in the frequency of G and T alleles (p = 0.056) and that of the GG, GT, and TT genotypes of rs7040 (p = 0.230) between the case and control groups (Figure 3C,D).\n\n3.2. VDR and VDBP Gene Polymorphisms Based on Allograft Rejection\n\nOut of the 115 cases of kidney transplants, 21.7% had a history of transplant rejection. The comparison of the frequency of VDR and VDBP alleles and genotypes distribution, concerning the graft rejection are depicted in Figure 4. As it can be seen, no significant difference was shown concerning the frequency of G and T alleles (p = 0.691) and the distribution of rs7975232 genotypes (p = 0.266), regarding the graft rejection (Figure 4A,B). Similarly, in the rs2228570 genotype, there was no significant difference in the frequency of G and T alleles (p = 0.281) and the distribution of the GG, GT, and TT genotypes (p = 0.428) between the acute rejection and the control groups (Figure 4C,D). Additionally, no significant change was detected between the frequency of T and C alleles (p = 0.689) and the distribution of the rs1544410 genotypes (CC, CT, and TT) (p = 0.361) (Figure 4E,F). As it can be seen in Figure 4G, the frequency of the G allele in the rs7040 genotypes was significantly low (p = 0.002) in patients with allograft rejection. Moreover, this allele increased the risk of transplant rejection to 0.27. The distributions of rs7040 GG and GT genotypes were lower in the rejection group; however, they were not statistically significant (p = 0.096) (Figure 4H).\n\n3.3. The Frequency of VDR and VDBP Gene Polymorphisms Based on Viral Infection\n\nThe comparison of the frequency of the studied genotype alleles, regarding the history of viral infections is depicted in Figure 5. No significant differences were observed in the frequency of G and T alleles (p = 0.302) and the distribution of the Apal genotypes between the recipients with the history of viral infection and the controls (Figure 5A,B). In the rs2228570 genotype, the frequency of T allele in patients with a history of viral infection was significantly lower than the controls (p = 0.030). This T allele showed a risk history of viral infections (Odd ratio = 2.035) (Table 3). The distribution of the TT rs2228570 genotype was also lower in the recipients with a history of viral infection, however, it was not significant (p = 0.074) (Figure 5C,D). The frequency of C and T alleles (p = 0.703) and the distribution of rs1544410 genotypes (p = 0.804) displayed no significant difference between the control and viral infection groups (Figure 5E,F).\n\nThe T allele frequency of rs7040 was significantly higher in cases with viral infections (p < 0.001) compared with the controls, with an Odd ratio of 0.40 (Table 3). Moreover, the distribution of the GG genotype of rs7040 was significantly lower (p = 0.004) in cases with a history of viral kidney infection compared with the controls (Figure 4 G,H).\n\n3.4.

Table 1 presented the genetic associations between IVs for serum 25OHD, Ca, and PTH levels and the risk of CAD in patients with diabetes. After searching in the PhenoScanner, rs780094 was found strongly associated with metabolic traits such as blood glucose, triglycerides, and total cholesterol, which may represent a pleiotropic SNP, while the remained SNPs were not related to any traditional risk factor of CAD in patients with diabetes.\n\nThe effect of serum 25OHD levels on the risk of CAD in patients with diabetes\n\nThere was no significant association between genetically predicted serum 25OHD levels, based on six SNPs, and the risk of CAD in patients with diabetes in the IVW analysis (odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58 - 1.87, P = 0.888). In line with this primary result, no significant association was observed in the sensitivity analyses using the weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO methods (Fig. 2). No evidence of heterogeneity was observed between the estimates of selected six SNPs (Q = 5.71, P = 0.336), and no potential directional pleiotropy was revealed in the MR-Egger intercept test (P = 0.243). Figure S4 presented the results of leave-one-out analysis, which indicated that rs3755967 might affect the association between serum 25OHD levels and the risk of CAD in patients with diabetes (Overall OR = 1.04, P = 0.888; OR after removing rs3755967 = 0.47, P = 0.149). However, rs375596 was not related to any traditional risk factor of CAD in patients with diabetes, based on the Phenoscanner search, namely, no evidence to support that rs375596 was a potential pleiotropic SNP was observed.\n\nThe effect of serum Ca levels on the risk of CAD in patients with diabetes\n\nNo significant association between genetic predisposition to serum Ca levels and the risk of CAD in patients with diabetes was found in the IVW analysis (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 0.62 – 5.35, P = 0.273). Similar results were observed in the sensitivity analyses (Fig. 2). Q statistics suggested no evidence of heterogeneity (Q = 9.99, P = 0.125) and the intercept of MR-Egger regression indicated no evidence of pleiotropy (P = 0.997). Though rs780094 was a potential pleiotropic SNP based on Phenoscanner search, the result of leave-one-out analysis indicated that association was attenuated but still insignificant (Overall OR = 1.83, P = 0.273; OR after removing rs780094 = 1.32, P = 0.529) (Figure S5).\n\nThe effect of serum PTH levels on the risk of CAD in patients with diabetes\n\nThe IVW analysis suggested no significant association between genetically determined serum PTH levels and the risk of CAD in patients with diabetes (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.67 – 2.44, P = 0.464), which was confirmed by the sensitivity analyses using the weighted median, MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO methods (Fig. 2). In addition, no evidence of heterogeneity (Q = 3.55, P = 0.470) and pleiotropy (P = 0.832) was observed in our study. The leave-one-out analysis indicated that this insignificant association was not disproportionally driven by any individual SNP (Figure S6).",

The mean age of the participants was 64.9 years and 43.2% were male. The mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 55.9 nmol/l (SD 27.6) and median CRP was 1.6 mg/l (IQR: 0.70–3.55). Study participants that had data on 25-hydroxyvitamin D available (n = 9,649) were divided in groups of sufficient vitamin D levels (n = 2,294), insufficient levels (n = 2,784) or deficient levels (n = 4,571). Participants from the population eligible for analysis were younger, had lower blood pressure, a lower prevalence of diabetes and a higher education than those from the non-eligible population (S2 Table). After correcting for age, the differences in systolic blood pressure and alcohol intake disappeared.\n\n Table 3 shows the results of the linear regression analysis of lnCRP on 25-hydroxyvitamin D. In the age, sex and cohort adjusted linear regression, lnCRP decreased with 0.13 unit (95% CI: -0.15, -0.11) per standard deviation increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There was a consistent trend across the three different categories of vitamin D levels (p = 4.98∙10−25). After further adjustment for BMI, SBP, eGFR, TC/HDL ratio, alcohol intake, smoking, prevalent diabetes, season of blood drawing, income and level of education, the effect estimates attenuated substantially (B = -0.06, 95% CI: -0.08, -0.03, p for trend = 4.48∙10−6).\n\nWe repeated these analyses with a quadratic term for vitamin D added to the regression model. Squared vitamin D was significantly associated with log-transformed CRP in both the first (p = 8.55∙10−9) and the second model (p = 3.21∙10−6) (S3 Table).\n\nMoreover, in a subset of RSI-3 in which we additionally adjusted for osteoporosis, we found similar results in the first and second model as in the previous analyses comprising the larger study population (Table 4). Our quadratic model was not significant in this subset (S4 Table).\n\nMendelian randomization analyses\n\nThe genetic risk scores for vitamin D and CRP were robustly associated with their respective phenotypes (S1 and S2 Figs). The 25-hydroxyvitamin D GRS explained 5.1% of the variation in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D GRS was not associated with lnCRP (n = 10,788, β = -0.018 per SD, p = 0.082). Moreover, there was no significant trend across the GRS quartiles (Fig 2). Associations of individual SNPs with lnCRP are shown in S5 Table. Among all, rs2282679 (GC: Vitamin D binding protein) was significantly associated with lnCRP (p = 0.027), however, after correcting for multiple testing this was no longer significant. The additional analysis that estimated the effect of the GRS for 25-hydroxyvitamin D on lnCRP in data of a CRP GWAS did not provide a significant result (p = 0.23). The CRP GRS explained 5.5% of the variation in lnCRP. We did not observe a significant association between the CRP GRS and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (n = 6,267, β = 0.001 per SD, p = 0.998). Similarly, after dividing the GRS in quartiles, there was no significant trend (Fig 2).",

    "content": "Results\n\nVKORC1 Haplotype Study\n\nA haplotype study of the 4.1 kb VKORC1 gene was carried out with seven VKORC1 SNPs genotyped in the 52 HGDP-CEPH population samples (Figure 1A). Haplotypes were reconstructed from these SNPs. Seven of these haplotypes had a frequency above 1% in at least one geographic region and were labeled H1 to H7 according to their frequency at the global level (Figure 1B). Four haplotypes are found in at least five geographic regions and only two are shared among all regions. The highest and lowest haplotype diversity values are observed in Sub-Saharan Africa (0.75±0.02) and East Asia (0.19±0.02), respectively. Most individuals carrying the ancestral haplotype (H6), i.e. the haplotype carrying the ancestral allele at each SNP, are from Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1B and Figure S1). Interestingly, the -1639A allele (rs9923231) conferring the increased sensitivity to AVK is carried by a unique haplotype (H1). This haplotype associated with AVK sensitivity is the most frequent at the worldwide level (49.7%) and shows an extremely high differentiation among geographic regions (Figure 1B). While rare in Sub-Saharan Africa (4.4%), it is found at intermediate frequencies in the Middle East, Europe, Central South Asia, Oceania and America (from 27.8% to 51.2%), and is largely predominant in East Asia (89.6%). The prevalence of H1 tends to be high in all of the 17 East Asian population samples investigated, ranging from 75% in She to 100% in Oroqen (Figure S1). However, the sample size is small for most of them, with 10 or less individuals.\n\nThe median-joining haplotype network describes the mutational relationships between the different VKORC1 haplotypes inferred (Figure 1C). Haplotype H1 differs from the others by two nucleotide substitutions at the functional rs9923231 SNP and at the rs9934438 SNP, which are found in complete LD in all geographic regions (D’ = 1 and r 2 = 1, Figure S2).\n\nDetection of Signatures of Positive Selection\n\nTo support the hypothesis that positive selection has played a role in shaping patterns of genetic variation at VKORC1, four complementary methods were applied to detect signatures of selective sweeps in the genome. FST and XP-CLR are both based on allele frequency differentiation, whereas XP-EHH and iHS are based on haplotype structure. Scores for the four test statistics were computed at both the regional and population levels for the seven VKORC1 SNPs and for some other available SNPs representing the expected neutral genomic background. For each score, a p-value was derived from the empirical distribution obtained from the genomic background (cf. Material and Methods). We considered as significant any p-value below 0.05. The results of the four tests are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\nAt the global level, when we evaluated the level of genetic differentiation among the seven HGDP-CEPH Panel geographic regions, an atypical pattern of genetic differentiation was detected for four VKORC1 SNPs: rs2359612, rs8050894, rs9934438 and rs9923231 (p<0.05). The functional rs9923231 polymorphism and the rs9934438 SNP, in complete LD with each other, displayed FST values falling above the 99th percentile of the empirical genome-wide distribution (FST = 0.32, p = 0.008) (Figure 2A). When global FST values were computed among the 52 world populations, very similar results were obtained (Table S1). At the inter-regional level, i.e. between a given geographic region and the remaining ones, the same four VKORC1 SNPs showed highly significant FST values (p<0.01) when comparing Central South Asia and East Asia to the rest of the world (Table 1, Figures 2B and 2C). Regarding East Asia, the highest FST values (FST = 0.41, p = 0.003) were also observed for the two SNPs, rs9923231 and rs9934438. For the other geographic regions, no VKORC1 SNP displayed an inter-regional FST value as much significant as the ones observed for Central South Asia and East Asia (Table 1 and Figure S3). At the intra-regional level, i.e. among populations within a region, no extreme pattern of genetic differentiation (p<0.01) was observed for any VKORC1 SNP in any geographic region (Table 1 and Figure S4).\n\nThe XP-CLR test applied to each geographic region also provided evidence of an atypical pattern of genetic differentiation at the VKORC1 gene locus, with XP-CLR scores in East Asia ranging from 16.53 (p = 0.050) to 43.44 (p = 0.012) in the 16 kb genomic region centered on VKORC1 (Table 2). For each of the other six geographic regions, the XP-CLR scores were very low, supporting the existence of a selective sweep restricted to East Asia. In this geographic region, when the XP-CLR test was performed for each population, all of the 17 population samples, except Oroqen, showed this extreme pattern of genetic differentiation, with at least three significant XP-CLR scores out of the five scores computed in the 16",

For each of the other six geographic regions, the XP-CLR scores were very low, supporting the existence of a selective sweep restricted to East Asia. In this geographic region, when the XP-CLR test was performed for each population, all of the 17 population samples, except Oroqen, showed this extreme pattern of genetic differentiation, with at least three significant XP-CLR scores out of the five scores computed in the 16 kb genomic region surrounding VKORC1 (Table S2). As most of the SNPs in the VKORC1 genomic region have reached fixation in the Oroqen sample, XP-CLR scores could be calculated for only very few SNPs on either side of VKORC1, making difficult the interpretation of XP-CLR results in this sample.\n\nRegional results obtained with the extended haplotype-based XP-EHH test indicated that the unusual pattern of genetic differentiation observed at the VKORC1 gene locus resulted from a selective sweep in East Asia. Significant XP-EHH scores, ranging from 2.68 (p = 0.011) to 3.10 (p = 0.005), were observed for the seven VKORC1 SNPs in East Asia, while no significant values were observed for any other geographic region (Table 1). For East Asian populations, evidence for a selective sweep was detected in all 17 population samples with significant XP-EHH scores for each of the seven VKORC1 SNPs, ranging from 1.84 (p = 0. 049) in the Dai sample for rs7294, to 3.78 (p = 0.004) in the Tujia sample for rs8050894 (Table S3).\n\nWith the iHS test, only two VKORC1 SNPs (rs7294 and rs2359612) exhibited significant iHS scores in East Asia (p = 0.040 and 0.047, respectively; Table 1). Two other significant scores were observed for the rs2359612 SNP in the Middle East (2.69, p = 0.009) and Europe (2.00, p = 0.039). At the population level in East Asia, only three samples (Hezhen, Lahu, and Yakut) displayed significant iHS scores for two, three and four SNPs, respectively (Table S3).\n\nThe four selection tests consistently evidenced the signature of a selective sweep involving the VKORC1 genomic region in East Asia. However, this result did not allow us to determine with certainty that VKORC1 is the direct target of positive selection. A linked gene could be the target instead, resulting in genetic hitchhiking of VKORC1 . In an attempt to seek the true target of positive selection, we probed the downloaded chromosome 16 genotypes with the four tests for selection and examined the results over an extended 2 Mb genomic region centered on VKORC1. We focused on clusters of selection test scores with highly significant p-values (p<0.01) for East Asia only. Three clusters were observed (Figure 3): (i) ∼ 570 kb downstream of VKORC1, the first cluster was found with partially overlapping clusters of extreme XP-CLR and XP-EHH scores over a region of 64 and 39 kb, respectively, involving the genes ITGAL, ZNF768, and ZNF747; (ii) at or close to VKORC1 genomic position, the second cluster was determined by overlapping clusters of extreme FST values when comparing East Asia to the rest of the world (with the lowest p-values observed for the same two VKORC1 SNPs evidenced before, rs9923231 and rs9934438) and extreme XP-CLR and XP-EHH scores. These clusters ranged in size from 45 to 244 kb; (iii) ∼ 230 kb upstream of VKORC1, the third cluster of 32 kb was found with XP-EHH and concerned the genes ITGAM and ITGAX. If SNPs within clusters are in high LD (D’≥0.97, except for one SNP in the third cluster), only limited LD exists between the SNPs located in the different clusters (Figure 4 and Figure S5) and several recombination hotspots are present between these clusters (Figure 4). This suggests that each of the three clusters represents a different adaptive event.\n\nExamination of the second cluster showed that VKORC1 is contained in a block of strong LD spanning ∼ 505 kb in East Asia (Figure 4 and Figure S5). Similar LD blocks were observed for Central South Asia and Europe, and to a lesser extent, for the Middle East (Figure S5). This LD block encompasses 25 genes (Figure 4). We used the most extreme FST, XP-CLR and XP-EHH scores in order to spatially localize a target of selection within the LD block. Significant XP-CLR scores (p<0.05) were found in a 350 kb region encompassing 19 genes including VKORC1 (Table S4). XP-EHH scores were almost all significant at the 0.05 threshold but four adjacent genes VKORC1, BCKDK, MYST1 (KAT8) and PRSS8 displayed most extreme XP-EHH scores (p<0.01). Clusters of highly significant FST values when comparing East Asia to the rest of the world (p<0.01) and significant global FST values (p<0.05) were also found for these four genes (Table S5). It is thus probable that the selective pressure has targeted one of these genes.\n\nWhen did the -1639A VK",

Our analysis yielded an age estimate of 181 generations (95% CI: 128–256 generations). Assuming a generation time of 25 years, the expansion therefore occurred about 4,525 years ago (95% CI: 3,200–6,400 years).",

    "content": "Results\n\nPatient demographic and clinical characteristics\n\nA total of 222 atrial fibrillation patients taking stable warfarin therapy before catheter ablation procedure were studied, and their demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 2. Patient age ranged from 21 to 71 years, with a mean age of 47.5 ± 0.72 years. Body surface area of patients ranged from 1.3 to 2.35 m2, with a mean of 1.7 ± 0.01 m2. 222 patients had successfully controlled their INR values to a range of 1.5 to 3.0 with a daily stable warfarin dose (2.05 ± 0.05 mg/day).\n\nGenotype analysis\n\nGenotypes of VKORC1 rs9923231, CYP4F2 rs2108622 and NQO1 rs1800566 were successfully determined for 222, 221 and 116 patients, respectively. The genotyping results in Table 3 showed that the frequency of the mutated allele of CYP4F2 rs2108622 and NQO1 rs1800566 was low - 19.5% of all patients carried the T allele of CYP4F2 rs2108622 and 13% carried the T allele of NQO1 rs1800566. In contrast, the frequency of the mutated allele of VKORC1 rs9923231 was high - 90% patients carried the A allele of VKORC1 rs9923231, while only 1 patient carried the wild type (GG). The genotype distributions of VKORC1 rs9923231 and NQO1 rs1800566 are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,except CYP4F2 rs2108622.\n\nImpact of VKORC1 rs9923231, CYP4F2 rs2108622 and NQO1 rs1800566 SNPs on the daily stable warfarin dose\n\nThe association of the daily stable warfarin dose with VKORC1 rs9923231, CYP4F2 rs2108622 and NQO1 rs1800566 genotypes is shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1. With regard to the VKORC1 rs9923231 genotype, the AG heterozygote carriers required a significantly higher warfarin dose (3.03 ± 0.28 mg/day; P < 0.001) than the AA carriers (2.52 ± 0.07 mg/day), while the single carrier of wild type GG required a much higher dose (7.19 mg/day) than the AG and AA carriers. In patients with CYP4F2 rs2108622 genotype, the CT and TT carriers required a significantly higher warfarin dose (3.38 ± 0.22 mg/day, P < 0.001; 2.79 ± 0.19 mg/day, P < 0.001, respectively) than the CC wild type carriers (2.41 ± 0.08 mg/day). With regard to the NQO1 rs1800566 genotype, the warfarin dose for the CT and TT carriers (2.46 ± 0.24 mg/day and 3.01 ± 0.27 mg/day, respectively) was not significantly higher than the CC wild type carriers (2.33 ± 0.1 mg/day).\n\nContribution of demographic characteristics and genotype variation to the daily stable warfarin dose\n\nMultiple linear regression analysis was used to investigate the contribution of demographic characteristics and genotype variation to the daily stable warfarin dose in Sichuan Han Chinese population. Our data indicate that several factors (VKORC1 rs9923231, CYP4F2 rs2108622, NQO1 rs1800566, age, weight, height and gender) contributed to 20.1% of individual variations in the daily stable warfarin dose (Table 4). VKORC1 rs9923231 exhibited a significant correlation with the daily stable warfarin dose (P < 0.001) and contributed the most (15%) to individual variations in the daily stable warfarin dose. CYP4F2 rs2108622 also contributed approximately 3% to variation in the daily stable warfarin dose (P < 0.001). However, NQO1 rs1800566 was not significantly associated with the daily stable warfarin dose (P = 0.12).",

    "content": "Results\n\nAnalysis of CYP2C9 & VKORC1\n\nOf the 65 patients who were designated sensitive (<21 mg/week) or resistant (>49 mg/week), six were identified whose therapeutic dose was discrepant from their algorithm-predicted dose based on the alleles tested below. Of these, one patient was identified with a nonsynonymous variant following CYP2C9 and VKORC1 exonic sequencing. This patient was a 61.1 year old HIV-positive African–American male (height: 188 cm; weight: 86.2 kg) with a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association class III heart failure) and stage three chronic kidney disease who was treated with anticoagulation since 2002 for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a target INR of 2–3 and a mean therapeutic warfarin dose of 14.4 mg/week. Other medications included aspirin, amiodarone, 200 mg daily, carvedilol, 6.25 mg twice daily, lisinopril, 5 mg daily, spironolactone, 25 mg daily, furosemide, 120 mg twice daily, lamivudine, 150 mg twice daily, zidovudine, 300 mg twice daily, potassium chloride and docusate. The patient had not developed bleeding complications during anticoagulation, nor had he required a blood transfusion. His blood chemistry values including liver function tests were normal and hepatitis serologies revealed no evidence of infection.\n\nPatients enrolled in the study were genotyped for eight CYP2C9 and 12 VKORC1 variant alleles (see Materials & methods) and the index patient described above had the following genotypes used for algorithm-based dose prediction: CYP2C9*1/*1; VKORC1 g.-4931T/C, g.-1639G/G, g.1173C/C, g.2255C/T, g.3730G/G; F7 g.-401G/G; APOE ε2/ε3. None of the seven tested warfarin resistant VKORC1 mutations were identified in this patient. The predicted doses from the 15 tested algorithms ranged from 24.9 to 52.2 mg/week and are summarized in Table 2. Based on the clinical features and identified genotypes, all algorithms predicted a significantly higher maintenance warfarin dose (24.9 to 52.2 mg/week) than this patient actually required, even when adjusted for renal clearance. In addition, although amiodarone inhibits CYP2C9 and decreases warfarin requirements, the eight algorithms, which included an adjustment for amiodarone or concomitant drug interaction predicted doses ranging from 24.9 to 50.1 mg/week, all greater than the observed 14.4 mg/week therapeutic dose.\n\nSequencing identified CYP2C9*8\n\nThe sensitivity to warfarin and the discrepancy between the therapeutic (14.4 mg/week) and algorithm-predicted (24.9 to 52.2 mg/week) warfarin doses in this patient prompted CYP2C9 and VKORC1 sequencing. In the CYP2C9 gene, one homozygous base substitution was identified in exon 3 (rs7900194, c.449A/A) and three heterozygous nucleotide changes were identified in exon 9 (rs9332240, c.1540C/T; rs9332241, c.1561C/T; rs9332243, c.1628C/T). The exon 3 variant, a known arginine to histidine substitution (p.R150H; Figure 1), has been classified by the Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Committee as CYP2C9*8. All three exon 9 transition polymorphisms were in the 3′;-UTR and have not been reported in known CYP2C9 haplotypes according to the Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Committee. No additional VKORC1 coding region or intron–exon boundary changes were identified.\n\nAfrican–American CYP2C9 allele frequencies\n\nThe CYP2C9*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *8, *11 and *13 allele frequencies were determined in 300 anonymous healthy African–American individuals from the greater New York, USA, metropolitan area and were compared with previous African–American CYP2C9 population data (Table 3). Representative PCR-RFLP genotyping for CYP2C9*8, *11 and *13 is illustrated in Figure 2. No CYP2C9*4 or *13 alleles were identified and *8 was the most prevalent variant allele (0.047) in this cohort with a combined heterozygote and homozygote frequency of approximately 1 in 11 individuals. The wild-type (*1) allele frequency was 0.867 and the identified variant alleles, *2, *3, *5, *6, *8 and *11, had a combined frequency of 0.133 (~1 in 4 individuals). To determine if CYP2C9*8 is specific to the African–American population, genomic DNAs (100 each) from Caucasian, Ashkenazi Jewish, Hispanic and Asian individuals were interrogated and the allele was only detected in Hispanics and Asians with frequencies of 0.015 and 0.010, respectively. The Hispanic frequency may represent an African contribution to the Caribbean Hispanic community of the New York metropolitan area.\n\nAll African–American CYP2C9 allele frequencies were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and the genotype frequencies are summarized in Table 4.

Based on their genotypes, the assigned metabolic phenotypes among the African–American individuals in our cohort were distributed as extensive (75.7%), intermediate (22.7%) and poor (1.7%) metabolizers. Notably, the high CYP2C9*8 frequency (0.047) made *1/*8 the most common intermediate metabolizer genotype in this population (8.7%). In addition, the inclusion of CYP2C9*5, *6, *8 and *11 in the genotyping panel reclassified approximately 16% of African–Americans compared with the predicted phenotypes using a panel consisting of only CYP2C9*2 and *3.\n\nAfrican–American VKORC1 allele frequencies\n\nThe VKORC1 allele frequencies were determined in the African–American cohort and were compared with previous African–American population data (Table 5). The VKORC1 g.-1639A sensitive allele, which is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with g.1173C>T, g.1542G>C and g.2255C>T in Caucasians, had a frequency of 0.108, consistent with other reports of the g.-1639G>A and g.1173C>T tag-SNPs, but lower than the reported g.1542G>C frequency in African–Americans (0.255). No g.85G>T (p.V29L), g.121G>T (p.A41S), g.134T>C (p.V45A), g.172A>G (p.R58G), or g.3487T>G (p.L128R) warfarin resistant alleles were detected; however, three African–American g.1331G>A (p.V66M) carriers were identified. These three samples were interrogated for additional VKORC1 alleles and the genotypes are listed in Table 6. In addition, the VKORC1 g.106G>T (p.D36Y) warfarin resistant allele found at a high frequency in Ashkenazi Jewish and Ethiopian individuals was analyzed and no African–American carriers were identified.\n\nAll African–American VKORC1 allele frequencies were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and the g.-1639G>A genotype frequencies are summarized in Table 7. By contrast to the Caucasian and Asian populations, the low g.-1639A frequency (0.108) resulted in only approximately 20% of African–American individuals carrying either the G/A or A/A genotype.",

    "content": "Results\n\nPatient characteristics\n\nDemographic, clinical and genotypic characteristics for our 60 African–American patients are shown in Table 1. The maintenance dose in these patients (6.8 mg/day) was higher than those for Caucasian and Asian patients, as reported previously. The patient demographics (mostly female with a larger body size) are consistent with previous reports of warfarin pharmacogenetics in larger cohorts of African–Americans. There was a significant (p < 0.01) correlation between BSA and body weight (r = 0.968) and female patients had a smaller BSA (1.96 vs 2.11 m2, p < 0.05). An association was found between CYP2C9*8 and rs12777823 (p < 0.05). Minor-allele frequencies for the genetic variants (CYP2C9*2, *3, *5, *6, *8, *11, rs7089580 and rs12777823) were consistent with those reported previously in African–American populations.\n\nRelationships between dose & Cp(S)\n\nThe estimated pharmacokinetic parameters in African–Americans are summarized in Table 2. Overlapping means and 95% CIs for population parameters obtained from the original dataset and those from the bootstrap values were observed. A high predictive performance with no systematic deviations of the final PPK model was demonstrated in the diagnostic plots (Figure 1A-C). These results suggested that the parameter estimates obtained can adequately describe the time courses of Cp(S) in African–American populations.\n\nPredictors of CL(S) & their impact\n\nThe median values (95% CI) of CL(S) for patients were 204 ml/h (92–382 ml/h, n = 39) for CYP2C9*1/*1, 161 ml/h (122–251 ml/h, n = 5) for CYP2C9*1/*2, 67 ml/h (n = 1) for CYP2C9*1/*3, 221 ml/h (n = 1) for CYP2C9*1/*5, 106 ml/h (n = 1) for CYP2C9*1/*6, 125 ml/h (71–228 ml/h, n = 12) for CYP2C9*1/*8 and *8/*8, 114 and 258 ml/h (n = 2) for CYP2C9*1/*11, 197 ml/h (101–365 ml/h, n = 14) for heterozygous rs7089580 and 147 ml/h (65–303 ml/h, n = 30) for hetero- and homo-zygous rs12777823, respectively. During the screening step, BSA, body weight, CYP2C9*8 and rs12777823 were extracted as significant covariates of CL(S) (p < 0.05). Age and CYP2C9 SNPs (*2, *3, *5, *6 or *11) exerted no significant effect on CL(S) in this population. As a strong internal correlation was observed between BSA and body weight, a final model based on either BSA or body weight was developed, respectively. During the deletion step, rs12777823 was removed from both models. In the final model constructed on the basis of BSA, CL(S) was expressed by the following equation:  where CYP2C9*8 = 0 in patients with CYP2C9*1/*1 and CYP2C9*8 = 1 in patients with CYP2C9*1/*8 or *8/*8 and 1.99 m2 was the median BSA. As shown in Equation 4, BSA with the exponential model (Equation 3 in Methods) and the CYP2C9*8 genotype were significant independent contributors to overall variability in CL(S), in other words, a 30% reduction in CL(S) for patients with CYP2C9*8 relative to patients with the wild-type and a 5% reduction in CL(S) per −0.1 m2 in BSA from 1.99 m2 to 1.89 m2, which was roughly equivalent to a −10 kg reduction in body weight from 93 kg to 83 kg (height = 164 cm) (Table 2 & Figure 2). As shown in Figure 2, CYP2C9*8 mutation had a stronger impact than BSA/body weight (0.1 m2/10 kg) on CL(S).\n\nSimulations of Cp(S) using algorithms with loading doses or maintenance doses\n\nPredicted time courses of Cp(S) following administration of maintenance doses estimated using the IWPC algorithm are shown in Figure 3A and those after the three loading doses estimated using the EU-PACT algorithm are shown in Figure 3B. The maintenance doses estimated for typical African–American patients carrying the CYP2C9*1/*1 and the respective VKORCI GG, GA or AA allele were 6.0, 4.5 and 3.5 mg/day, respectively. The predicted maintenance doses estimated using the IWPC algorithm were approximately 1.0 mg/day lower than those observed in patients with the CYP2C9*1/*1 and the respective VKORC1 GG or GA allele. As the IWPC algorithm does not include the CYP2C9*8 variant as a covariate for dose prediction, patients with the CYP2C9*8 allele would receive the same doses as patients with CYP2C9*1/*1, which might lead to a 1.4-times higher average Cp(S) at the steady state (Cpss) in patients with any of the",

In addition, simulations showed that the determinant of the average Cpss values might be the VKORC1 genotype (e.g., patients with the insensitive GG genotype would require a higher dose, and thus a higher Cpss, than patients carrying the sensitive AA genotype in order to maintain the therapeutic INR) as well as the CYP2C9 genotype, while the time to reach 95% of the steady state value is determined by CL(S), i.e., the CYP2C9 genotypes in this simulation (i.e., 10 days for patients with CYP2C9*1/*1 and 14.5 days for patients with CYP2C9*8, irrespective of the VKORC1 genotype) (Figure 3A). In the case of the loading dose algorithm (EU-PACT) being employed, the time to reach 95% of the steady state would be reduced (i.e., 2 days for patients with CYP2C9*1/*1 and 10 days for patients with CYP2C9*8), whereas the same average Cpss observed after the maintenance dose would be attained (Figure 3B). When a 30% lower dose was used for patients with CYP2C9*8 in the loading dose algorithm, the differences in the time to reach 95% of the steady state and the average Cpss between patients with the CYP2C9 wild-type and those with CYP2C9*8 would be eliminated (Figure 3C).",

    "content": "Results\n\nSelection of SNPs for analysis\n\nWe have selected SNPs from non-synonymous coding region (nsSNPs), coding synonymous region (sSNPs), UTR (5′ and 3′) and intronic region SNPs for our analysis. Out of 539 SNPs, coding region contains 37 (6.9%) non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and 31 (5.8%) coding synonymous SNPs. Non-coding region contains 414 SNPs (76%) in intronic region and 57 SNPs (10.5%) in mRNA UTR region. It can be seen from the above results that vast majority of SNPs occur in the intronic region. The coding non-synonymous regions and SNPs in regulatory regions were selected for our investigation. The functional impact of nsSNPs can be assessed by evaluating the importance of the amino acids they affect.\n\nAnalysis of deleterious nsSNPs using SIFT\n\nSIFT predicts whether an amino acid substitution affects the protein function based on sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acid. Protein sequence with mutational position and amino acid residue variants were submitted as input in SIFT server and the results are outlined in Table S1. A total of 46% nsSNPs were predicted as intolerant by SIFT score of 0.00, 24% of the variants had score ranging from 0.01–0.05 and 30% of the variants exhibited score ranging from 0.06–0.10 respectively. Thus 70% of nsSNPs were predicted to be intolerant, that could bring about changes in protein function. A lower score 0.00–0.05 indicates that the nsSNPs is more damaging to protein function. Such scores enable the quantitative comparison and ranking of SNPs in the order of their biological significance, and are useful for researchers to decide which SNPs of a gene they should first look at.\n\nAnalysis of deleterious nsSNPs using PolyPhen\n\nAll protein sequences submitted to SIFT were also submitted to PolyPhen. Unlike SIFT, it does not solely depend on sequence homology alone to make SNP functional predictions as its modeling of the amino acid substitutions is also based on structural information. The PolyPhen output comprises a score that ranges from 0 to a positive number, with zero indicating a neutral effect of amino acid substitutions on protein function. Conversely, a large positive number indicates that the substitution is detrimental to protein function. According to PolyPhen score, 33% of the nsSNPs were found to be “Possibly damaging” to protein structure and function; 12% of the nsSNPs exhibited PolyPhen scores of 1.99–1.50 indicating that the variants were “Possibly damaging” to protein function and the remaining 55% were characterized as benign (Table S1). Such scoring is once again useful as ranking of SNPs according to their significance can be carried out to enable quantitative assessment of the severity of the effect on protein function.\n\nIdentification of functional nsSNPs using I-Mutant 2.0\n\nThe protein stability change due to single point mutation was predicted using support vector machine-based tool I-Mutant 2.0. All the nsSNPs submitted to SIFT and PolyPhen were also submitted as input to the I-Mutant 2.0. According to I-Mutant 2.0, more negative the free energy value (DDG value); less stable the given point mutation is likely to be. Out of 37 variants, 4 variants (L323P, I48T, V68M and Q310P) which showed DDG value of −2.07, −2.05,−3.32 and −2.20 respectively, were considered to be least stable and deleterious. The other 11 variants R285H, R459P, R463H, D350H, D181V, D113N, Q11H, N126D, S437V, G200C and R339P showed DDG value between −1.00 to −2.00 and the remaining 15 variants showed DDG value less than 0.00 (Table S1).\n\nPrediction of deleterious nsSNPs using PANTHER\n\nAll the nsSNPs with maximum significant score using SIFT, PolyPhen and I-Mutant 2.0 were further analyzed using PANTHER for validating its impact on protein function upon single point mutation. PANTHER is able to classify proteins by function, thus adding another layer of complexity to refine SNP prediction. This tool is able to generate a variety of outputs, the most useful being the probability that a particular variant is deleterious. Out of 37 nsSNPs taken for our analysis, 8 nsSNPs with subPSEC score less than -5 were designated as highly deleterious, out of which the amino acid substitution position at A44G, R163C and Q310P showed a good correlation with SIFT, PolyPhen and I-Mutant 2.0 scores respectively. Hence the following SNPs with ID rs78478128, rs74315362 and rs11558370 having subPSEC scores −5.29666, −8.05846 and −7.51475, were selected for further modeling analysis. The remaining 18 variants having subPSEC score less than -3 were found to be deleterious and eleven nsSNPS with subPSEC score greater than -3 were predicted to be intolerant using PANTHER (Table S1). The nsSNPs which were predicted to be deleterious in causing an effect in the structure and function of the protein by SIFT, Poly",

The remaining 18 variants having subPSEC score less than -3 were found to be deleterious and eleven nsSNPS with subPSEC score greater than -3 were predicted to be intolerant using PANTHER (Table S1). The nsSNPs which were predicted to be deleterious in causing an effect in the structure and function of the protein by SIFT, PolyPhen, I-Mutant 2.0 and PANTHER correlated well experimental studies as shown in Table S1 [.\n\nCombination of the Prediction Programs for deleterious nsSNPs\n\nPrediction of deleterious nsSNPs can be made more accurate by combining different computational methods. Thus, we combined Empirical and SVM based prediction programs, and found that this could significantly increase prediction performance in deleterious nsSNPs analysis. We used the SIFT, PolyPhen, I-Mutant 2.0 and PANTHER programs to predict the influence of nsSNPs on protein function and structure. Figure 1 shows the distribution of predicted scores of SIFT, PolyPhen, I-Mutant 2.0 and PANTHER. Since a lower SIFT or PANTHER or I-Mutant 2.0 score indicate that the nsSNP of interest would be more deleterious, whereas a higher PolyPhen score indicate that the nsSNPs of interest would be more deleterious. Out of 37 nsSNPs, 26 nsSNPs were predicted to be deleterious by SIFT, PolyPhen predicted 16 nsSNPs as damaging, 26 nsSNPs as deleterious by PANTHER and 30 nsSNPs as less stable by I-Mutant 2.0. Out of all predictions, 70%, 43%, 70%, and 80% were specific to SIFT, PolyPhen, PANTHER and the I-Mutant 2.0, respectively, and 9 nsSNPs (24%) were predicted to be functionally significant by all four methods. We found that I Mutant 2.0 was able to predict 80% deleterious nsSNPs, slightly higher than SIFT (70%) and PANTHER (70%). However, PolyPhen predicted only 43% of deleterious nsSNPs which uses a normalized cross-species conservation score and combines this with a variety of protein structural features when available. Most of these differences are likely the result of each method requiring a sufficient number and diversity of aligned sequences in order to make a prediction, each method using a different set of sequences and alignments. We have shown that our data suggests that individual tools correlate modestly with observed results, and that combining information from a variety of tools may significantly increase the predictive power for determining the functional impact of a given nsSNP.\n\nCharacterization of functional regulatory elements in 5′ and 3′ untranslated region by UTRscan\n\nIn this method, the effect of UTRs on phenotypic variation has been elucidated with the help of patterns of functional sequences deposited in the UTRSite and UTRdb. In this method, the integration of genomic data with UTRdb transforms it into an efficient annotation technique as well as a powerful retrieval resource for the UTR subsets. The UTRscan server however did provide some useful indicators with respect to the functional effects of 3′ and 5′ UTR SNPs of G6PD and PK genes. All the 57 UTR SNPs (3′ and 5′) were analyzed using UTRscan. After comparing the functional elements for each UTR SNPs, we found 11 SNPs in the 3′ UTR and 12 SNPs in 5′ UTR have different functional pattern(s) for each sequence, and were predicted to have functional significance. Totally, 23 SNPs in both 3′ and 5′ regions were found to be functionally significant as shown in Table S2. Among these SNPs, 9 of them were related to the functional pattern change of Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES), 10 of them were related to the functional pattern change of Musashi binding, 4 of them related to functional pattern change of K-Box, 3 of them related to functional pattern change of Terminal oligopyramidine track and one of them were related to functional pattern change of SXL (Sex-lethal) binding site, Selenocysteine insertion sequence type 1 [SECIS], UNR binding site, Polyadenylation signal respectively.\n\nPrediction of functional nsSNPs by FASTSNP\n\nFASTSNP tool help in classifying and prioritizing phenotypic risks and deleterious effects of SNPs based up on their influence over determining protein structure, pre-mRNA\\splicing, deviation in transcriptional levels of the sequence, alterations in the premature translation termination, deviations in the sites at promoter region for transcription factor binding, etc. However, FASTSNP could not predict the functional importance of the SNPs in the 5′ and 3′ regions. 25 nsSNPs were found to be functionally significant in coding region. Out of which 10 SNPs were predicted to affect the splicing site with a risk ranking of 3–4, 14 SNPs were predicted to affect splicing regulation with a risk ranking of 2–3 and 1 coding nonsense SNP (rs11558352) was detected with a very high (5–5) level of risk, as it can truncate and even inactivate the PKM2 protein, causing diseases (Table S3).\n\nModeling of deleterious nsSNPs\n\nSingle amino acid",

So, the knowledge of a protein's 3D structure is essential for a full understanding of its functionality. Mapping the deleterious nsSNPs into protein structure information was obtained from dbSNP and SAAPdb. Mutation analysis was performed based on the results obtained from highest SIFT, PolyPhen, I-Mutant 2.0 and PANTHER scores. The mutations at their corresponding positions were performed by SWISS-PDB viewer independently to achieve modeled structures. Then, energy minimizations were performed by NOMAD-Ref server for the native type protein and mutant type structures.\n\nGlucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD)\n\nIn G6PD gene, mutation occurred for native protein in ‘A’ chain of PDB ID [2BHL] at position A44G with SNP ID rs78478128 and at R459P with SNP ID rs72554665. It can be seen that the total energy value of native type (−25480.939 Kcal/mol) and mutant modeled structure A44G and R459P were found to be −25299.660 Kcal/mol and −25296.779 Kcal/mol respectively. The RMSD value between the native and the mutant A44G, R459P were 1.88 Å and 1.74 Å. The superimposed structures of the native protein 2BHL (chain A) with the mutant type proteins A44G of G6PD gene is shown in (Figure 2A).\n\nPyruvate Kinase isoforms (PKLR & PKM2)\n\nIn PKLR gene, mutation occurred for native protein in ‘A’ chain of PDB ID [2VGB] at position R163C with SNP ID rs118204083, R486W with SNP ID rs116100695 and T384M with SNP ID rs74315362. It can be seen that the total energy value of native type and mutant modeled structure R163C, R486W and T384M were found to be −24360.674 Kcal/mol and −24081.020 Kcal/mol, −24090.248 Kcal/mol, −24084.902 Kcal/mol respectively. The RMSD values between the native and the mutant type R163C, R486W and T384M were found to be 2.82 Å, 2.74 Å and 2.52 Å. Similarly in PKM2 gene, mutation occurred at ‘A’ chain of PDB ID [1T5A] at positions C31F with ID rs11558375, G200C with ID rs11558354 and Q310P with ID rs11558370. The total energy value were found to be −24868.992 Kcal/mol for native protein and −24623.072 Kcal/mol, −24654.807 Kcal/mol, −24608.215 Kcal/mol for mutant type C31F, G200C and Q310P respectively Their respective RMSD value were found to be 2.45 Å, 2.4 Å, 2.8 Å. Higher the RMSD value more will be the deviation between native and mutant type structures and which in turn changes their functional activity. The superimposed structures of the native protein 2VGB with the mutant type protein R163C, of PKLR gene is shown in (Figure 2B) and the superimposed structure of native protein 1T5A and mutant type model Q310P of PKM2 gene is shown in (Figure 2C). These figures were drawn using PyMOL54 release 0.99. Green color cartoon model by PyMOL54 release 0.99 represents the native structure while blue color cartoon model represents mutant modeled structure respectively.\n\nComputation of stabilizing residues in native and mutant modeled structures of G6PD and PK genes\n\nWe used the SRide server for identifying the SRs in native type structure and mutant modeled proteins in G6PD, PKLR, and PKM2 genes (Table 1). From this analysis four SRs were found to be common in both native structure (2BHL) and mutant model R459P of G6PD gene. In mutant model R459P, three stabilizing residues were found namely Ala338, Gln372, and Gln308, which revealed that these stabilizing residues could be the major factor in destabilizing the 2BHL structure. In PKLR gene all the four SRs, Ile90, Cys401, Ala495, Ile553 respectively were identical in native protein (2VGB) and mutant models R163C, R486W and T384M. Four SRs (Gly122, Cys358, Ala452 and Ile510) were identified to be identical in native type protein (IT5A) and mutant model G200C and Q310P of PKM2 gene. In mutated model (C31F), one additional residue Cys49 was found which may play key factor in destabilizing the structure.",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nPopulation‐based screening for G6PD deficiency\n\nAll subjects were first examined by DBS G6PD activity fluorescence screening. A total of 506 G6PD‐deficient subjects (male: 276, female: 230) were identified among 15,690 participants (male: 7470, female: 8220) under population‐based screening. Subsequent PCR‐RDB and PCR sequencing were used to identify G6PD variant sites of the G6PD gene in the G6PD‐deficient subjects. As a result of lyonization, heterozygous‐deficient females have a normal and G6PD‐deficient population of erythrocytes (Jiang et al., 2006; Song et al., 1999). Thus, it is very difficult to detect all heterozygous‐deficient females. Therefore, we only employed the data from male participants to represent the frequency of G6PD deficiency in different ethnic populations. As shown in Table 1, the gene frequency of G6PD deficiency in males in each group differed; a high prevalence of G6PD deficiency was observed in two original ethnic populations of southern China, specifically 11.16% G6PD deficiency in the Zhuang population and 9.07% in the Dai population. In contrast, the lowest two prevalence of G6PD deficiency were observed in Tibetan and Mongolian ethnic backgrounds (Table 1).\n\nThe “malaria hypothesis” of G6PD deficiency was proposed over half a century ago and is now widely accepted, but little evidence has been obtained from Chinese populations. In this study, the pattern of G6PD deficiency was geographically concordant with the area of China with historical prevalence of malaria and synchronously varied with the incidence of malaria (Figure 1a). To the best of our knowledge, the risk of malaria transmission is strongly influenced by environmental factors, such as altitude and air temperature. Therefore, the frequencies of G6PD deficiency in different geographical coordinates (altitude, longitude, and latitude) were analysed by regression analysis. The results of regression analysis indicated that the genetic frequency of G6PD deficiency has a negative correlation with the altitudes (r = −0.668) and latitudes (r = −0.575) where subjects live (Figure 1b). Additionally, we subsequently classified the populations according to their average altitude; 5 ethnic populations lived below 600 metres, and 7 lived above 1000 metres (Table 1). The frequencies of G6PD deficiency in low‐altitude populations were significantly higher than those in high‐altitude populations (p < 0.05) (Table 1).\n\nAnalysis of G6PD variants\n\nA total of 13 G6PD variants were identified from the 506 G6PD‐deficient individuals. Detailed information on the G6PD variants from the 12 ethnic groups is shown in Figure 1a and Table 2. The five most frequently occurring G6PD gene variants were G6PD Canton (NM_001042351.3:c.1376G>T), G6PD Kaiping (NM_001042351.3:c.1388G>A), G6PD Gaohe (NM_001042351.3:c.95A>G), polymorphism (NM_001042351.3:c.1311T>C), and G6PD Chinese‐5 (NM_001042351.3:c.1024C>T). However, the frequencies varied in different ethnic populations. The G6PD Viangchan (NM_001042351.3:c.871G>A) and G6PD Mahidol were observed at low frequencies (1–5%) in some ethnic populations, such as Dai, Jino and Li. After the analysis of the DNA sequence, a rare G6PD deficient variant, G6PD Baise (NM_001042351.3:c.448G>A (p. Val150Ile)), was identified from a male with a low G6PD value (1.6 U/gHb). With the program PolyPhen‐2, the novel deficient variant was predicted to be probably damaging with a Humdiv score of 0.992 (sensitivity: 0.70; specificity: 0.97). Moreover, the change of free energy difference before and after mutation was calculated, and ΔΔG was 0.22 (Figure S1), which indicated that the protein structure would tend to be destabilized by the V150I mutation.\n\nExtended LD around G6PD deficient alleles\n\nTo examine the pattern of LD in the 2.4‐Mb region encompassing the human G6PD gene, all possible pairwise |D′| values (Lewontin, 1964) among the Tag SNPs were calculated in the random Zhuang population (n = 744). The detailed data are listed in supporting material 1. Pairwise comparisons showed a strong LD within Tag SNPs, which was consistent with theoretical expectations (Figure 2a). A 67‐kb block was formed among the Tag SNPs around three G6PD‐deficient alleles (Canton: rs72554664, Kaiping: rs72554665 and Gaohe: rs137852340) based on the four‐gamete rule method, indicating a hitchhiking effect due to linkage with these deficient alleles. In addition, the three G6PD deficient alleles showed a high degree of LD with upstream and downstream Tag SNPs at a distance ranging from ~179 kb to ~923 kb (although some of the Tag SNPs had no statistical significance) (Figure 2b–d).\n\nTest for recent selection on G6PD deficient alleles\n\nLong‐range haplotype test (LRH) using the REHH parameter",

In addition, the three G6PD deficient alleles showed a high degree of LD with upstream and downstream Tag SNPs at a distance ranging from ~179 kb to ~923 kb (although some of the Tag SNPs had no statistical significance) (Figure 2b–d).\n\nTest for recent selection on G6PD deficient alleles\n\nLong‐range haplotype test (LRH) using the REHH parameter was conducted to test for recent natural selection on the three G6PD‐deficient alleles (Canton, Kaiping and Gaohe) (Sabeti et al., 2002). A variant under neutral evolution would take a long time to reach a high frequency, and the LD around the variant would decay substantially during this period due to recombination (Qiu et al., 2013). In contrast, alleles under positive selection would rise to a high frequency so quickly that long‐range associations with neighboring polymorphisms would not be disrupted by recombination. In this LRH test, we assigned the core region containing one Tag SNP (rs1050757) and two G6PD‐deficient alleles (Canton: rs72554664 and Kaiping: rs72554665) using the default parameters in Sweep software. As shown in Figure 3a, at a distance of 0.9 cM from the focal alleles, the REHH value of the G6PD Kaiping allele‐bearing haplotype in the population reached 9.0, while the REHH value of the G6PD Canton allele‐bearing haplotype in the population reached 3.6. Compared with other Tag SNPs, the observed REHH values of the two alleles bearing haplotypes were significantly greater (p < 0.05). This result of evolutionary analysis showed that the G6PD Canton allele and Kaiping allele were under recent and strong positive selection in the population, indicating that these alleles have received a strong selective advantage for human survival. However, we did not observe a positive signature of recent natural selection on the G6PD Gaohe allele.\n\nAn approach introduced by Voight et al. (2006) was employed to obtain a crude estimate of the age of the G6PD‐deficient allele. In this method, age was calculated using the equation Pr[Homoz] = e− 2rg, where Pr[Homoz] is the probability that two chromosomes are homozygous at a recombination distance r from the selected site, given a common ancestor g generations before the present. In this instance, we used a linear regression to evaluate the value of g through the transformation formula −ln(EHH) = g × 2r based on our EHH data. As shown in Figure 3c,d, the parameters of generation g of the G6PD Canton allele and Kaiping allele were 125 and 200 in the population, respectively. Assuming a generation time of 25 years for humans, the age is approximately 3125 years before present (YBP) for the G6PD Canton allele (if the human generation time is 30 years, the age is 3750 YBP) and approximately 5000 YBP for G6PD Kaiping (if the human generation time is 30 years, the age is 6000 YBP).\n\nOrigin of the G6PD deficient alleles in Chinese populations\n\nTo investigate the origin of primarily G6PD‐deficient alleles in Chinese populations and Southern Asian populations, data from our study or mined from the NCBI and CNKI databases (Table 2) were further analysed. A heatmap of different G6PD‐deficient allele frequencies was generated. As shown in Figure 4, the color of each block deepened as the corresponding frequencies increased. The color scale ranged from blue for the lowest allele frequency to red for the highest allele frequency. Clearly, cluster I (Chinese populations except Tibetan and Jino) exhibited relatively high frequencies of three G6PD‐deficient alleles (Canton, Kaiping and Gaohe), while another cluster II (Southern Asian populations) showed large frequencies of G6PD Viangchan and G6PD Mahidol. Additionally, in almost all Chinese ethnic populations (Table 2), the total frequency of G6PD deficient alleles (Canton, Kaiping and Gaohe) was above 70%. It is suggested that these G6PD‐deficient alleles (Canton, Kaiping, and Gaohe) occurred before the formation of these Chinese ethnic populations. Hence, based on the abovementioned results, we speculated that the genetic ancestries of the G6PD Canton and Kaiping alleles might originate from one ancient Chinese population (Figure 3b).",

    "content": "Results and discussion\n\nAt the study beginning, all patients were working or studying. They were in very good health and without complaints. Mean weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) were respectively 180.7 ± 10.1 cm, 83.4 ± 31.6 kg, and 25 ± 7 for males and 164.7 ± 2.6 cm, 63.7 ± 9.1 kg, and 23.5 ± 3.8 for females. Three patients were under the control of nephrologist in the place of residence, due to sustained nephrocalcinosis (stable from infancy). Urolithiasis and progressive renal failure, reported in IIH (Molin et al.) did not occur in any of the patients included in molecular study. Serum creatinine concentration measured in two patients was at bordeline of the control values (1.29, 1.13 mg/dl).\n\nThe results of molecular studies are shown in Table 1. In all 11 adults, the historical diagnosis of IIH was confirmed at the molecular level with 100% compliance. We detected pathogenic variants in one of two genes studied, CYP24A1 in nine patients and SLC34A1 in two remaining ones. The latter subset was already included in the original publication (Schlingmann et al.).\n\nIn CYP24A1, two novel variants c.107del (p.P36Lfs*11) and c.1157 + 1G > A (p.?) as well as five known variants [c.428_430del (p.E143del), 443 T > C (p.L148P), c.964G > A (p.E322K), c.1186C > T (p.R396W), c.1226 T > C (p.L409S)] were identified in homozygous or compound heterozygous state (Table 1). Missense variant p.R396W occurred in seven of nine CYP24A1 mutated persons (11/18 alleles; four homozygotes and three compound heterozygotes). Previously this variant, found in four of 1024 control alleles, was annotated as putative polymorphism; however, it finally concluded as pathogenic (Schlingmann et al.).\n\nFour p.R396W alleles were found in 588 samples (1176 alleles) from general Polish population. Based on this data the frequency of p.R396W allele was calculated as 0.0034 (0.34%; 1:294). Using the Hardy-Weinberg’s law the frequency of p.R396W carriers in the Polish population was estimated as 0.0068 (0.68%; 1:147). Taking into account that p.R396W make up approximately 61.1% of CYP24A1 alleles, overall carrier frequency for all mutation in CYP24A1 was calculated as 1.11% (1:90). Thus, the expected incidence of CYP24A1 deficient IIH in Poland was estimated as 1:32,465 births (with 0.95 confidence interval). A thousand potentially affected CYP24A1 deficient persons may be living in the country.\n\nThe study group of IIH, at start considered genetically homogeneous, turned out to be divided in two. Laboratory data was re-analyzed in two subsets of patients, with CYP24A1 and of SLC34A1 defects. Age of onset, total/daily vitamin D dose, duration of hypercalcemia, prednisone treatment, milk free diet, calcium/phosphate concentrations and excretion, 25OHD, 1,25(OH)2D, and PTH levels were assessed separately (Table 1). We were not able to identify any unequivocal feature useful to distinguish CYP24A1 from SLC34A1 defect at presentation of hypercalcemia in infancy. Only two potentially important differences have to be mentioned: (1) the previously reported finding that 25OHD concentration in IIH probands, carriers of two mutated variants, was twice as high as in their parents, carriers of a single mutated allele (Rowińska et al.), was observed only in the families with CYP24A1 defect, (2) kidney stones were found in one father of an IIH proband (Rowińska et al.) with SLC34A1 defect. Unfortunately those old findings are anecdotal (data no longer available) and have to be verified in the future study.\n\nDespite the fact that, in the light of present knowledge, our historical diagnosis of “hypersensitivity to vitamin D” is correct for both, the CYP24A1 and the SLC34A1 defects, the identical treatment options may require a revision. We may speculate, e.g., that the long-term calcium restriction and vit. D avoidance might be incorrect and possibly harmful for the patients with SLC34A1 defect (P10 and P11). Alternative treatment with phosphates supplementation should be considered and evaluated. By the way, increased phosphate intake was recommended constantly for our patients with IIH, and was even tested in a short experiment (Rowińska et al.), however no differences in response to phosphates between individual patients were observed and no conclusions were then attained.\n\nThis lack of laboratory difference is likely due to strict control of the calcium-phosphate homeostasis to avoid the negative effects of vitamin D excess on concentration of both calcium and phosphate during mineralization. In such a situation the optimal condition for mineralization requires feedback reaction in the direction opposite to primary genetic defect (e.g., calcium absorption in SLC34A1 and phosphate re-absorption in CYP24A1). As a result,",

As a result, the final effect of elevated 1,25(OH)2D is similar in both SLC34A1 and CYP24A1 defects (Fig. 1). It seems obvious, however, that counteracting the consequences of both defects may be different; hence, the need to establish the molecular background of IIH is crucial, not only in infants but also in adults.

Moreover, 25(OH)D3 serum concentrations were determined in an additional 227 patients from the SCCS in whom a plasma sample at the time of a liver biopsy was available.

They were largely comparable to those previously observed in the general population.\n\nIn a pooled analysis across all HCV genotypes, there was a progressive decrease in SVR rates according to CYP27B1-1260 rs10877012 genotype (73% SVR for genotype AA, 65% for AC and 62% for CC), suggesting an additive effect of the SNP. However, the association was not significant (P = 0.11, OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.954–1.552). Significance level increased in a multivariate model, after adjustment for HCV genotype, age, sex, baseline viral load, BMI, ALT, diabetes, and IL28B rs12979860 genotype (P = 0.06, OR = 1.33, CI = 0.988–1.796, Table 3) or when comparing rs10877012 CC carriers to AA carriers (P = 0.04). When the association of CYP27B1-1260 rs10877012 with SVR was examined in patients stratified according to IL28B rs12979860 genotype CT and TT vs. CC, as shown in Figure 1, CYP27B1-1260 rs10877012 was an independent predictor of SVR in patients with the poor-response genotype CT or TT (65% vs. 57% vs. 51% SVR in CYP27B1-1260 rs10877012 AA vs. AC vs. CC, respectively; univariate P = 0.06; multivariate P = 0.02, OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.061–2.188, Table 4) but not in those with the good-response genotype CC (P = 0.8).\n\nA similar impact of CYP27B1-1260 rs10877012 on SVR was observed when patients infected with genotype 1 and 4 were analysed exclusively. Again, CYP27B1-1260 rs10877012 genotype had no significant influence on SVR in patients with good-response IL28B rs12979860 genotype (SVR rates 88% vs. 65% vs. 73% for AA vs. CA vs. CC, respectively; P = 0.62). However, SVR rates in HCV genotype 1 and 4 patients with poor-response IL28B rs12979860 genotype were 42% vs. 39% vs. 30% in CYP27B1-1260 rs10877012 AA vs. AC vs. CC, respectively (univariate P = 0.11; multivariate P = 0.09, OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 0.940–2.288), but the association formally lost statistical significance, most likely due to the low number (n = 24) of HCV genotype 1 and 4 patients with CYP27B1-1260 rs10877012 AA and poor-response IL28B rs12979860 genotype. With respect to the low frequency of the beneficial minor A allele, CYP27B1-1260 rs10877012 does not appear to be a suitable parameter for clinical decision making. Nevertheless, our genetic analyses point to a relevant role of vitamin D metabolism in the response to treatment with PEG-IFN-α and ribavirin of chronic hepatitis C.\n\nSerum Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C\n\nSerum concentrations of 25(OH)D3 were determined in 496 patients at baseline of treatment with PEG-IFN-α and ribavirin (n = 269) or at the time of liver biopsy in patients who were not treated (n = 227). Mean and median 25(OH)D3 serum concentrations were 15.6 and 13.4 ng/mL (SD = 9.07; range 3.8–76.9 ng/mL), respectively, which are significantly lower than those determined in the general population (e. g. 22.2 and 20 ng/mL in Reusch et al., n>6.000). Among patients with chronic hepatitis C, 32%, 42%, and 26% had 25(OH)D3 serum levels <10, ≥10 to <20, and ≥20 ng/mL, respectively. Because of the seasonal fluct",

Among patients with chronic hepatitis C, 32%, 42%, and 26% had 25(OH)D3 serum levels <10, ≥10 to <20, and ≥20 ng/mL, respectively. Because of the seasonal fluctuation of 25(OH)D3 serum levels, we calculated median 25(OH)D3 serum levels separately for each month. Although season had a substantial impact on median 25(OH)D3 serum levels, at least 50% of HCV-infected individuals suffered from vitamin D insufficiency (<20 ng/mL) even during summer, while approximately 50% suffered from vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/mL) between November and April (Figure 2).\n\nIn a univariate analysis, age, male sex, infection with HCV genotype 3, excessive alcohol consumption, presence of diabetes, advanced liver fibrosis, and season of blood sampling were significantly associated with low 25(OH)D3 serum levels (< median; Table 5). In logistic regression analyses, age, advanced liver fibrosis, presence of diabetes, and season of blood sampling were independent and significant predictors of low 25(OH)D3 serum levels (Table 5).\n\nSerum Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and Treatment Outcome\n\nSince 25(OH)D3 serum concentrations were only available in a subgroup of all treated patients included in this study (n = 269), we analyzed their relationship to treatment outcome separately from the above-described CYP27B1 candidate gene study. In univariate analyses, no significant associations between SVR and 25(OH)D3 serum levels either as continuous variable (p = 0.13, OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.95–1.01), or 25(OH)D3 serum levels ≥10 ng/mL (p = 0.3, OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.43–1.30) and ≥20 ng/mL (p = 0.08, OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.36–1.10) were observed. Formally, these associations may be even interpreted as a statistical trend towards an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D3 serum levels and SVR after treatment with PEG-IFN-α and ribavirin. However, in multivariate models adjusted for other predictors of treatment outcome (age, sex, IL28B rs12979860 genotype, HCV genotype, HCV RNA levels, presence of diabetes, BMI, and liver fibrosis), 25(OH)D3 serum levels were clearly not associated with treatment outcome (p = 0.9 for 25[OH]D3≥20 ng/mL). These findings were similar when HCV genotype 1/4 or 2/3 patients were analyzed separately (data not shown).",

    "content": "Results\n\nIdentification of a new cause of cblC named epi-cblC\n\nWe initially identified the MMACHC secondary epimutation in two infant females with paternal transmission, case CHU-12122 (died at 1 month of age, Caucasian ancestry) and case WG-3838 (died at 2 months of age, Japanese and Korean ancestry) and in a 59-year-old male (case WG-4152, Caucasian ancestry). The cblC diagnosis was based on metabolic and fibroblast complementation analyses. Patient clinical and metabolic data are detailed in the Methods section.\n\nSanger sequencing of MMACHC in DNA of CHU-12122 revealed a single heterozygous c.270_271insA, p.Arg91LysfsX14 mutation, which was also identified in her unaffected mother and maternal grandfather (Fig. 1a). The maternal grandfather and the father had serum concentrations of homocysteine of 33.6 and 17.0 µmol/L, respectively (reference levels <15 µmol/L). No sequence variant in MMACHC was identified in the father and no additional gene mutations were identified in the patient and her relatives using the TruSight NGS Illumina panel of the genes involved in metabolic diseases. We performed methylation analysis of the MMACHC gene by PCR amplification and cloning, followed by Sanger sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA. This revealed a heterozygous epimutation consisting of 32 hypermethylated CpG sites in a CpG island encompassing the promoter and first exon of MMACHC (Chr1:45,965,587–45,966,049) (Fig. 1b, c). The epimutation was observed in fibroblast DNA from the patient, blood and sperm DNA from her father, and blood DNA from her paternal grandfather. We detected a c.-302G allele of the rs3748643 bearing the epimutation and a c.-302T allele bearing the non-methylated allele. The epimutation and c.-302G allele of rs3748643 were absent in the DNA from the mother and maternal grandmother (Fig. 1a, c). The MMACHC allele bearing the c.270_271insA mutation was the only one detected by RT-PCR analysis of patient fibroblast transcripts. Treating the fibroblasts with 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), produced bi-allelic MMACHC expression (Fig. 1d). Taken together, these results showed an epimutation causing promoter hypermethylation and MMACHC silencing in the paternally transmitted allele and a c.270_271insA mutation in the allele inherited from the mother. The epimutation was present in three generations; it was transmitted to CHU-12122 by her father, and to her father by her grandfather and was present in the sperm of CHU-12122’s father.\n\nSanger sequencing of MMACHC in blood DNA of WG-3838 revealed the presence of a previously reported heterozygous c.81G>A splice variant in the patient, her mother, and a deceased brother (Fig. 2a). RT-PCR of fibroblast transcripts found no detectable MMACHC cDNA. No paternal MMACHC mutation was identified. Sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA identified the same mono-allelic epimutation as that identified in CHU-12122 in blood DNA samples from her and her father and in sperm from her father; the patient was compound heterozygous for the c.81G>A mutation and the MMACHC epimutation (Fig. 2b). In contrast to CHU-12122, the c.-302T allele of the rs3748643 c.-302 G>T polymorphism was detected with the epimutation and the c.-302G allele tagged the non-methylated allele. Taken together, these data showed a presentation similar to case CHU-12122. The epimutation silenced MMACHC gene expression in the fibroblasts.\n\nSequencing of the MMACHC gene in blood DNA of WG-4152 identified a previously described heterozygous c.158T>C (p.Leu53Pro) mutation. Sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA identified the same mono-allelic epimutation found in CHU-12122 and WG-3838. The patient was compound heterozygous for the c.158T>C mutation and the MMACHC epimutation. The c.-302G allele of rs3748643 was detected in the allele bearing the epimutation and the c.-302T allele in the non-methylated allele.\n\nConfirmation of the epimutation by epigenome-wide analysis\n\nWe performed an epigenome-wide study of DNA from the 3 epi-cblC cases and their relatives using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (HM450K). The methylation variation positions (MVPs) of the three cases were compared to those observed in 690 DNA samples from a Caucasian population from the Asthma BRIDGE consortium (USA), 350 DNA samples from a Caucasian population recruited in the South of France (the MARTHA cohort), and one typical cblC (CHU-09011) sample with compound heterozygosity for the same mutation as CHU-12122 in exon 2 (c.270_271insA, p.Arg91 > LysfsX14) and an exon 4 mutation (c.616C>T, p.Arg206Trp). The HM450K array included eight probes covering the CpG sites of the epimutation (Fig. 1b",

The HM450K array included eight probes covering the CpG sites of the epimutation (Fig. 1b). HM450K methylome profiling in the three epi-cblC cases and their relatives confirmed the results obtained by Sanger sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA (Fig. 2c, Fig. 2d). The epimutation was also confirmed in sperm from the fathers of the CHU-12122 and WG-3838 cases. The CpG hypomethylation in sperm DNA from a control population from Utah was similar to that observed in the genomic DNA of the control subjects (Fig. 2e). We observed only one subject in the control population with the same hypermethylation of the MMACHC sites as was reported in the epi-cblC cases and their relatives. The allele frequency of the epimutation was therefore not higher than 5 × 10−4 in the control population. We also confirmed the absence of the MMACHC epimutation in the CHU-09011 cblC case.\n\nTo compare the epigenome-wide changes between the three cases and their relatives with those from the control population, we plotted the difference between the beta methylation coefficients of the MVPs in cases and relatives and those reported in the MARTHA control population for each CpG site probed in the HM450 array. The ‘epi-Manhattan’ plot generated by this analysis showed that the MMACHC epimutation was the single change greater than 0.3 that reached a high level of statistical significance (Fig. 3a). In the control population, the CpG island that encompassed the promoter and the first exon of MMACHC was hypomethylated and surrounded by hypermethylated CpG sites (Fig. 3b, c). This corresponded to an ‘epi-haplotype block’ composed of the eight CpG sites probed by the HM450K array (Fig. 3b, c). Expression of MMACHC is regulated by a transcription regulatory complex of proteins that involves HCFC1, THAP11, and ZNF143. Analysis of the HM450K methylome failed to find any aberrant hypermethylation related to HCFC1-ZNF143-THAP11 in our epi-cblC cases.\n\nWe performed ChIP-Seq analyses on the chromatin of case and control fibroblasts to further characterize the epigenetic changes at MMACHC and neighboring genes (Fig. 4a). We observed a significant accumulation of trimethylated lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me3) in the MMACHC promoter region and the proximal part of the 5′ adjacent CCDC163P gene only in patients harboring the epimutation (Fig. 4a). In contrast, all control and patient samples show the absence of the H3K36me3 mark in the promoter region of PRDX1, the gene 3′ to MMACHC (which was associated with the absence of DNA hypermethylation).\n\nThe MMACHC epimutation occurs secondary to a PRDX1 mutation\n\nWe performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of DNA from cases CHU-12122 and WG-3838 and their relatives to determine whether the promoter hypermethylation of MMACHC was a secondary epimutation that resulted from a genetically heritable variant. The only sequence variant that segregated with the phenotype across all samples was in PRDX1 (Fig. 4b and Fig. 5a). PRDX1 is located adjacent to MMACHC and on the opposite strand. We found a c.515-1G>T mutation of PRDX1 in cases CHU-12122 and WG-4152 and a c.515-2A>T mutation of the same gene in WG-3838 (Fig. 4b). These PRDX1 mutations were also found in the relatives who carried the secondary epimutation, i.e., the father and paternal grandfather of CHU-12122 and the father of WG-3838 (Fig. 5a). The PRDX1 variants and the polymorphism rs3748643 associated with the secondary epimutation were present in the same allele as evidenced by DNA sequencing and transmission in the heterozygous relatives (Fig. 1c and Fig. 2b).\n\nPresence of the secondary epimutation in additional cases\n\nWe replicated our results in five cases from two other centers. We found the secondary epimutation and the c.515-1G>T PRDX1 mutation in all five cases, and confirmed the maternal transmission of the PRDX1 mutation with the secondary epimutation in one case (Supplementary Table 1). The c.515-1G>T variant was present in seven individuals of European ancestry out of 66,000 individuals reported in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database (estimated frequency in the general population 1.052 × 10−4).\n\nThe epimutation results from PRDX1 antisense transcription\n\nMMACHC belongs to a trio of reverse (R1)–forward (F2)–reverse (R3) genes with dual partial overlaps of MMACHC by CCDC163P and PRDX1 at its 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The two mutations in PRDX1 affect the canonical splice acceptor site of intron 5, 1",

The two mutations in PRDX1 affect the canonical splice acceptor site of intron 5, 1 and 2 bp apart, respectively. They are predicted to disrupt normal splicing and to produce skipping of exon 6 and the polyA transcription termination signal of PRDX1. We confirmed this prediction by single-strand RNA-Seq and RT-PCR analyses of case fibroblasts, and found that the loss of transcription termination of PRDX1 produced an aberrant extension of antisense transcription through the MMACHC and CCDC163P genes. The level of antisense transcripts was high in case fibroblasts and undetectable in control fibroblasts. The activation of cryptic acceptor sites and the resulting skipping of exons and introns of MMACHC generated several transcripts identified in both RNA-Seq and RT-PCR. Among them, we identified a predominant 1.0 kb transcript that encompassed the exons 4 and 5 of PRDX1, the CpG island and the bidirectional promoter, and the first exon of CCDC163P (Fig. 5b, Fig. 6a, b, c). This transcript resulted from the activation of a cryptic antisense splicing site located in the middle of MMACHC exon 1 (Fig. 6d, e).\n\nWe further demonstrated that the PRDX1 mutation produced the silencing of MMACHC expression through the methylation of its promoter. To address this issue, we silenced the expression of PRDX1 with siRNA transfection in WG-3838 fibroblasts and the cell line MeWo-LC1. We used WG-3838 fibroblasts because of the complete absence of detectable sense transcription of MMACHC exons. We showed previously that the MeWo-LC1 melanoma-derived cell line had a cblC phenotype and no transcription of MMACHC . We found recently that this cell line had the same antisense transcription of PRDX1 found in patient fibroblasts. We observed that the silencing of PRDX1 restored the expression of MMACHC in both cell lines and that it produced 10–15% hypomethylation of the allele initially fully methylated in the clones generated from bisulfite-treated DNA. No effect was observed in control fibroblasts transfected with the PRDX1 siRNA and in WG-3838 fibroblasts and MeWo-LC1 cells transfected with a control siRNA (Fig. 6f, g).",

    "content": "Results\n\nRelevant characteristics of the 219 bladder cancer cases and 273 controls participating in the pilot investigation are summarized in Table 2. By design, cases and controls were similar with respect to age, race and gender. Approximately 75% of participants were men, 95% were white and the mean age at diagnosis (among cases) and at interview (among controls) was 66 years (standard deviation ± 9.5 years). Bladder cancer cases were more likely to report that they had either formerly smoked or were current smokers at the time of diagnosis compared to controls at time of interview (78% versus 53%; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the estimated mean number of pack-years among smokers was higher among cases than controls. As has been reported in the larger case–control study, there was no significant difference between genotyped cases and controls in lifetime average exposure to arsenic (p = 0.45) with an estimated median concentration of 1.36 μg/L (interquartile range = 3.33 μg/L) in the study population.\n\nThe genotype distribution observed for each of the tested SNPs among controls was consistent with HWE. Table 3 summarizes the findings of our post-hoc testing of associations between genotype for each SNP and bladder cancer risk adjusted for age and smoking history, however this adjustment produced little difference from the crude estimates of risk. We did not observe any significant associations between SNPs in GSTO-1, As3MT and MTHFR and bladder cancer risk overall with one exception. Bladder cancer cases were 60% less likely to be homozygotes for the A allele in rs1476413 in MTHFR compared to controls (OR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.18-0.88).\n\nWe then stratified the study population according to genotype, examining the differences in the distribution between time-weighted average (TWA) of arsenic exposure (divided into quartiles and measured continuously) between cases and controls (Tables 4 and 5). There was evidence for interaction between several of the SNPs in As3MT and arsenic exposure. Among persons with one or more copies of the C allele in rs11191439 (Met287Thr), higher average arsenic exposure was associated with an increase in the odds of bladder cancer (OR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.04-1.32 per 1 μg/L increase). However, no association was observed between average arsenic exposure and bladder cancer among individuals who were TT homozygotes for the same SNP. This same polymorphism was also associated with an increase in the odds of bladder cancer among all study subjects, however the estimate was not statistically significant (OR = 2.75; 95%CI = 0.47-16.77 among CC homozygotes). Interactions with SNPs rs3740400, rs11191438 and rs7085104 and arsenic exposure were also observed (Table 4). These SNPs were in strong LD with one another (r2 values ranging from 0.83-0.95) ( Additional file 1: Table S1). And while there was nominal evidence for interaction with the rs4925 SNP in GSTO-1 and arsenic exposure, we not find evidence for interaction with selected SNPs in MTHFR and arsenic (Table 5). Haplotype-based association analyses for the As3MT gene were consistent with the single SNP results (Table 6). No evidence for an association between haplotypes in the As3MT gene and bladder cancer was detected when using the entire sample of participants. There was, however, an association between the As3MT haplotype which included the Met287Thr polymorphism (compared to the most common or referent haplotype) and bladder cancer for participants exposed to arsenic concentrations higher than 3.72 μg/L (the uppermost quartile) (OR = 3.90; 95% CI = 1.39-10.9), but not among those exposed to lower concentrations.",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\ndHMNX patient-derived iPSCs maintain pluripotency and normal karyotype\n\nSkin fibroblasts from the dHMNX patient harbouring the p.T994I ATP7A mutation were reprogrammed using non-integrative episomal plasmids by FUJIFILM Cellular Dynamics following company in-house protocols. The presence of the p.T994I mutation (nucleotide change c.2981C>T) was confirmed by genomic DNA sequencing (Fig. 1A). Karyotyping and G-banding analysis showed the two clones generated from the re-programming (iPSCT994I_1 and iPSCT994I_2) maintained a normal 46,XY karyotype (Fig. 1B). Pluripotent characteristics of the iPSC lines were confirmed by three experimental approaches. iPSC colonies stained positive for the pluripotency markers Oct-4A, Sox2 and Nanog (Fig. 1C), and protein expression of these transcription factors was absent (Fig. 1D) in the original patient fibroblast lines (FibrdHMNX). Reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that endogenous pluripotency-associated genes (CDH1, LIN28, FOXD3, NANOG and TDGF1) were expressed at higher levels in the iPSCs when compared to the FibrdHMNX cells (Fig. 1E). \n\nPatient-derived iPSC lines display pathogenic features associated with dHMNX patient fibroblasts\n\nOur previous investigations had shown dHMNX patient fibroblasts have reduced levels of ATP7A localizing at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Although dHMN is an adult-onset syndrome, this phenotype was also observed in embryonic fibroblasts from a conditional knock-in mouse expressing the dHMNX-causative mutation. Staining of iPSCs showed a pattern of intracellular distribution for ATP7A in both the cytoplasm and within the TGN in control iPSCs, with reduced levels of ATP7A in the patient-derived iPSCs (Fig. 2A,B). Assessing the total levels of ATP7A protein by western blot analysis (Fig. 2C) confirmed decreased expression of ATP7A under basal Cu conditions (0.5 µM CuCl2) in the iPSCT994I clones when compared with the iPSCCtrl. Despite the reduced protein expression of ATP7A in the iPSCT994I clones, patient-derived cells did not accumulate intracellular Cu under basal or Cu loading conditions (Fig. 2D). Accordingly, no differences were found between the iPSCT994I and iPSCCtrl lines when Cu-induced toxicity was assessed (Fig. 2E). \n\nDifferentiation of dHMNX-derived iPSCs into spinal cord motor neurons\n\ndHMNX patients develop muscle weakness and wasting due to axonal degeneration of motor neurons. To develop a neuronal model for dHMNX, iPSCT994I and iPSCCtrl lines were differentiated into adherent spinal cord motor neurons using protocols that were initially reported by Chambers et al. (2009) and subsequently modified by to generate neuronal models of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT), a group of hereditary neuropathies involving both the motor and sensory neurons of the PNS. For this protocol, neuralization of the iPSCs is achieved by dual SMAD signalling inhibition (dorsomorphin and SB431542) and neuronal patterning triggered with retinoic acid (RA) and activation of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway with Smoothened agonist (SAG). Later addition of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) collectively contribute to mature motor neuron development (Fig. 3A). \n\nOur protocol has been slightly modified and maturation of differentiating motor neurons takes place in a three-dimensional (3D) culture system (days 18-26). This additional step has been adapted from and has recently been applied to patient-derived iPSC lines for modelling CMT. In these conditions, differentiating motor neurons aggregate on suspended spheres (spheroids). On day 26 of the in vitro differentiation protocol (26 DIV), spheroids are dissociated into single cells and cultured in the presence of 0.01 μM SN38-P from 28 DIV onwards for the removal of proliferative stem cells. Within 1 week of adherent differentiation, immunofluorescence analysis revealed the efficient induction of HB9 and ISL-1, markers for somatic motor neurons (Fig. 3B and ). The presence of these markers was significantly upregulated in the suspension 3D culture following the SN38-P treatment when compared with the monolayer differentiation process (∼50% versus ∼3%, respectively), where PAX6+ cells are enriched (∼0.4% versus ∼35%; ).

After 7 days of adherent differentiation, cells organized into clusters that contain motor neuron cell bodies, with extending axons connecting these structures (Figs 3B and 4A). Staining with an anti-ATP7A antibody at 32 DIV and observation at low magnification (20×) showed a decrease in the levels of ATP7A within the cell bodies of patient motor neurons (Fig. 4A and ). Using the HB9 staining, we defined the areas of the cultures occupied by clusters of cell bodies and quantified the levels of ATP7A under basal Cu conditions. Using this approach, we found a significant decrease in the levels of ATP7A of dHMNX-derived motor neurons within these clusters, while no difference was observed in the axonal compartment (Fig. 4B). Motor neurons differentiated from an additional iPSC line [derived from an X-linked CMT type 6 (CMTX6) patient] that expresses wild-type ATP7A showed expression of ATP7A equivalent to MNCtrl. This result indicates that the reduction in the levels of ATP7A protein seen in the dHMNX motor neurons is a disease-specific phenotype (). \n\nCu-induced ATP7A trafficking and Cu homeostasis is not affected in dHMNX-derived motor neurons\n\nATP7A trafficking properties in response to intracellular Cu levels have been extensively investigated. However, Cu-dependent mobilization of wild-type and mutant forms of ATP7A in motor neurons have not been studied under physiological conditions due to the lack of the appropriate research models. Differentiated control and dHMNX-derived motor neurons were cultured under basal (0.5 µM CuCl2) and high (100 µM CuCl2) Cu levels, and the distribution of ATP7A assessed by confocal microscopy at 32 DIV. Observation at high magnification (63×) showed ATP7A perinuclear localization in the soma of control motor neurons under basal conditions. In contrast, this perinuclear localization was not observed in the patient cells under the same experimental settings (Fig. 5A and ). Previous studies showed that overexpressing the ATP7A p.T994I mutant protein in the spinal cord/neuroblastoma hybrid cell line (NSC-34) led to mutant ATP7A re-localizing from the TGN compartments to the cell body's plasma membrane under basal Cu conditions and to the axonal plasma membrane after NSC-34 differentiation. Under our more physiological conditions, however, ATP7AT994I is not observed at the plasma membrane of axons nor cell bodies in the presence of low Cu. When we cultured iPSC-derived motor neurons in the presence of high levels of Cu, ATP7A extensively localized to axonal compartments in both control and patient-derived cells (Fig. 5A and ). In our experimental approach, individual axons are bundled together so we are unable to determine the precise axonal localization of ATP7A (axonal plasma membrane versus axoplasm). Quantification of ATP7A levels in the axonal compartment confirmed the visual observation and showed no difference between control and dHMNX-derived motor neurons under basal or high Cu levels (Fig. 5B), suggesting that Cu-induced trafficking is not affected by the p.T994I mutation. \n\nWestern blot analysis of protein lysates from differentiated motor neurons showed a significant decrease in ATP7A levels in the patient cells. Intracellular Cu accumulation increases steady-state ATP7A protein levels through stabilization of the protein by Cu. Using patient fibroblasts and primary cells from our Atp7aT985I knock-in mouse model, we had shown that the dHMNX mutation impairs this post-translational mechanism of ATP7A regulation. Our experiments using iPSC-derived motor neurons confirm that exposure to Cu increases ATP7A protein levels in control cells and motor neurons cultured from our additional CMTX6-derived iPSC line (20%), which serves as an additional control. This effect is absent in the dHMNX-derived motor neurons (Fig. 5C and ). Despite the reduction in the ATP7A protein levels in the patient motor neurons, the levels of ATP7A available in the mutant cells are sufficient to maintain Cu homeostasis under basal and Cu loading conditions (Fig. 5D) with no increased Cu-induced toxicity observed in the dHMNX lines at DIV 32 (Fig. 5E). Further maturation/aging of the iPSC-derived motor neurons (DIV 45) did not affect this result, suggesting an alternative mechanism(s) to defective Cu transport and mobilization of ATP7A in response to Cu as a dHMNX pathomechanism ().\n\nMitochondrial features and bioenergetics are affected in dHMNX-derived motor neurons\n\nDelivery of Cu into the mitochondria is fundamental for cellular respiration. To determine whether mitochondrial features were affected by the ATP7A mutation, iPSC-derived motor neurons were stained with MitoTracker (Fig. 6A), and morphological features of individual mitochondria determined in MNCtrl and MNT944I clones (Fig. 6B). Although the mean length of mitochondria was the same between control and patient-derived cells, the number of mitochondria as well as the axonal coverage (proportion of axons occupied by mitochondria) was found to be significantly reduced in the dHMNX-derived motor neurons.

Addition of specific respiratory complex inhibitors revealed no significant differences in the ATP-linked respiration or maximal respiration between these lines.

Four cases had mutations in the acetylcholine receptor subunits (3 in epsilon (CHRNE), 1 in delta subunit (CHRND)), one had mutation in the choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) gene and two had mutation in the collagenic tail of endplate acetylcholinesterase (COLQ) gene. One patient had mutation in the GFPT1 gene.\n\nOther patients of Turkish origin (living in Turkey or elsewhere)\n\nAccording to our literature search, 35 cases of CMS of Turkish origin have been reported. Eleven of these mutations are in the AChR epsilon subunit, twelve in COLQ, seven in CHAT, two in MUSK, two in MYO9A, and one in AGRN.\n\nPatients with CHRNE and CHRND mutations\n\nA total of 14 patients had mutations in the CHRNE gene and one case had mutation in the CHRND gene. Eleven of these cases were previously reported. They all had ptosis, ophthalmoplegia and bulbar or limb involvement before 4 years of age, mostly at birth. Symptoms started at the age of 7 years in one patient. None of the patients showed progression of disease nor had respiratory crisis. Constant findings at advanced ages were ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. Four patients did not respond to anticholinesterase drugs and in the remaining patients, the response to anticholinesterase drugs were partial. Repetitive stimulation of the hypothenar muscle did not show decrement in 9 of 14 tested cases while single fiber electromyography showed increased jitter in all tested cases.\n\nOne patient harbored a homozygous mutation (p.L331F) in the AChR delta subunit. The parents were consanguineous. Symptoms started at birth with ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, bulbar weakness and apnea attacks. Respiratory findings and bulbar weakness decreased with advancing age. She is now 7 years old and the primary findings are ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. Repetitive stimulation showed a greater than 10% decrement in abductor digiti minimi muscle. She benefited from pyridostigmine bromide. 3,4 diaminopyridine (3,4 DAP) and salbutamol were not tried. Her aunt had hypotonia and ptosis and died at the age of one year because of respiratory insufficiency.\n\nPatients with COLQ mutations\n\nA total of 14 cases had mutations in COLQ gene. Twelve patients were previously reported. The median age was 8.9 years (18 months – 17 years). The disease manifested from birth to up to two years of age. Three patients were hypotonic at birth. Seven patients had motor developmental delay. Ptosis, restricted eye movements, facial weakness, bulbar weakness and respiratory crisis were the main presenting findings. Proximal muscle weakness (n=12), axial muscle weakness (n=7), scoliosis (n=5) and neck weakness (n=5) were other important findings. Six patients had respiratory crises and two patients had tracheostomy. Six patients had decremental EMG at repetitive stimulation and a repetitive compound muscle action was observed in one patient. Two patients had slow pupillary response. Most patients had worsening of their symptoms with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory therapy. Salbutamol, ephedrine and 3,4-DAP were the most effective treatments. One patient did not benefit from salbutamol and ephedrine treatment. Most patients were motor handicapped and needed assisted ventilation during the follow up. Seven patients were homozygous for the p.W148* mutation, two were homozygous for the c.1082delC mutation, one patient was compound heterozygous for the mutations p.W148* and p.R236*, and one was homozygous for p.R236*. Other patients were homozygous for the mutations c.1281C>T (p.C427=; creation of a cryptic splice donor site), p.N309S and p.Arg227*, respectively.\n\nPatients with CHAT mutations\n\nEight patients had mutations in CHAT and all were previously reported. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 6.4 years (range: 6 months – 14 years). The disease manifested from the neonatal period to up to the age of two years. Ptosis, apnea, hypotonia, bulbar weakness, facial weakness, generalized weakness, exercise intolerance and crises with respiratory insufficiency were the presenting findings. In three patients, apneas were misdiagnosed as seizures leading to antiepileptic treatment. Seven patients were mentally retarded. Patients benefited from therapy with AChE inhibitory agents and 3,4-DAP. In one patient, apneic attacks responded to diazepam treatment. In half of the patients, no pathologic EMG decrements were recorded. Creatine kinase levels were normal in all. Muscle biopsy examinations in four patients were unremarkable or showed only non-specific myopathic changes. The clinical course was normal in only one patient, and one patient died. The others had varying degrees of ptosis, psychomotor retardation, muscle weakness, bulbar weakness, and respiratory crises with intermittent ventilation. Two patients had tracheostomy. Seven patients were homozygous for the p.I336T mutation and one patient for the p.G417R mutation.\n\nPatients with AGRN mutations\n\nOne patient had mutations in the AGRN gene.

The parents were not consanguineous. Main clinical findings were fatigable limb weakness from early childhood. Facial weakness was mild without bulbar and ocular symptoms. Repetitive stimulation of the accessory nerve resulted in more than 10% decrement. Creatine kinase levels were normal with minimal myopathic changes in muscle biopsy. A trial of oral pyridostigmine bromide worsened symptoms while oral salbutamol was effective.\n\nPatients with MYO9A mutations\n\nTwo previously reported siblings aged 5 and 11 years born to consanguineous parents had a homozygous missense mutation (p.D1698G) in the MYO9A gene. The family history included four previous children dying in the first year of life due to respiratory failure, feeding difficulties and hypotonia. The current patients had reduced fetal movements. Generalized hypotonia, ptosis, nystagmus, oculomotor apraxia, ophthalmoplegia, bulbar weakness and motor retardation were noticed from early age. One of the siblings also had mental retardation.

    "content": "4. Disorders Resulting from Defective Heme Biosynthesis in Erythroid Cells\n\nHeme is mainly produced by erythroblasts and hepatocytes. Whereas heme negatively regulates the expression of ALAS1 via a feedback mechanism in nonerythroid cells (hepatocytes), it does not negatively regulate ALAS2 in erythroblasts; in fact, heme can promote its own synthesis by regulating ALAS2 expression through the IRP-IRE system. Therefore, the regulation of heme biosynthesis should be considered separately in erythroid and nonerythroid cells. In addition, a defect in any heme biosynthetic enzyme does not result in uniform systematic consequences. For example, defects in PBGS or HMBS impair heme biosynthesis in the liver, leading to the onset of ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ADP) or acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), respectively, whereas no abnormality is observed in erythroblasts. On the other hand, defects in FECH or UROS do not severely impair heme biosynthesis in the liver but instead result in the onset of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) or congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP). Accordingly, each disorder is referred to as either hepatic or erythropoietic porphyria.\n\nThis review mainly focuses on hematologically relevant human disorders resulting from defects in heme biosynthesis, such as sideroblastic anemia and erythropoietic porphyria.\n\n4.1. Sideroblastic Anemia\n\nSideroblastic anemias are a heterogenous group of syndromic and nonsyndromic disorders with the common features of mitochondrial iron accumulation in bone marrow erythroid precursors (ring sideroblasts), ineffective erythropoiesis, increased tissue iron levels, and varying proportions of hypochromic erythrocytes in the peripheral blood. Whereas these syndromes are commonly acquired and predominantly associated with myelodysplastic syndrome, of which a significant portion of cases might result from a mutation in the RNA splicing machinery componentsplicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1), congenital forms of sideroblastic anemia (CSA) have been reported; it is a rare and heterogeneous disease caused by mutations of genes involved in heme biosynthesis (ALAS2, SLC25A38), iron-sulfur [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis (ABCB7, GLRX5), iron reduction (STEAP3), and mitochondrial protein synthesis (mitochondrial DNA, PUS1, YARS2, TRNT1, and SLC19A2) (described in) (Table 1).\n\n4.1.1. X-Linked Sideroblastic Anemia\n\nThe most common form of CSA is XLSA (X-linked sideroblastic anemia), which is attributed to mutations in the X-linked gene ALAS2. Defects in ALAS2 result in decreased protoporphyrin synthesis and subsequent reductions in iron incorporation and heme synthesis, leading to microcytic anemia and the appearance of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Typically, XLSA patients are male and present before the age of 40 years; however, this disorder occurs across a broad range of ages and can affect elderly patients. On the other hand, anemia may also present in heterozygous female carriers, presumably because of skewed X inactivation or the excessive age-related skewing that occurs in hematopoietic tissues.\n\nMost of the XLSA-associated mutations in ALAS2 are missense substitutions resulting in loss of functionality, whereas mutations in the ALAS2 regulatory region, such as the promoter and intron 1, lead to decreased ALAS2 expression. ALAS2 missense mutations commonly decrease the binding of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP, vitamin B6), which is a cofactor for ALAS2 enzymatic activity, thus accounting for the PLP responsiveness in XLSA patients carrying such mutations. However, nearly half of XLSA cases are unresponsive to PLP. In such cases, ALA supplementation might mitigate these impairments. In our recent preclinical in vitro analysis, ALA restores defects in ALAS2 deficiency based on human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived erythroblasts. Because ALA is an endogenous amino acid that has been shown to be safe in clinical settings, it might be considered to administer ALA in patients with XLSA who are refractory to PLP supplementation.\n\n4.2. Erythropoietic Porphyria\n\nErythropoietic porphyria includes both erythropoietic protoporphyria and congenital erythropoietic porphyria. The former comprises two variants, erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLPP), and is classified among the cutaneous porphyrias characterized by the accumulation of protoporphyrin IX, which results in photosensitivity. EPP and XLPP are clinically indistinguishable but result from the mutations of different genes: FECH and ALAS2, respectively.\n\n4.2.1. Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP)\n\nEPP is an inherited disorder caused by a partial deficiency in FECH activity. In this disorder, protoporphyrin accumulates in the erythroblasts and is subsequently taken up by the liver and skin. Cutaneous photosensitivity characteristically begins in childhood in the absence of neurological involvement. Liver damage is observed in patients with severe symptoms. In addition, hypochromic microcytic anemia occurs in 20–60% of cases, and ring sideroblasts may be observed. Elevated levels of erythrocyte protoporph",

Cutaneous photosensitivity characteristically begins in childhood in the absence of neurological involvement. Liver damage is observed in patients with severe symptoms. In addition, hypochromic microcytic anemia occurs in 20–60% of cases, and ring sideroblasts may be observed. Elevated levels of erythrocyte protoporphyrin are observed. However, in contrast to iron deficiency anemia and lead poisoning, in which the increased erythrocyte protoporphyrin is chelated with zinc, erythrocytic protoporphyrin in EPP remains in a free state.\n\nThe inheritance of EPP is considered autosomal recessive but is a bit unusual. In most patients, EPP results from the coinheritance of a specific FECH mutation in trans with a hypomorphic low-expression FECH polymorphism (IVS3-48C). The IVS3-48C allele of this polymorphism increases the use of an aberrant splicing site that may contribute to disease onset. Ethnic differences have been reported in the frequency of the IVS3-48C allele; specifically, the frequency of this allele differs widely among Japanese (43%), southeast Asian (31%), white French (11%), North African (2.7%), and black West African (<1%) populations.\n\nBesides avoiding exposure to sunlight, the treatment for EPP includes the oral administration of β-carotene and afamelanotide, transfusion of cholestyramine red cells, and, in severe cases, liver transplantation. Low-dose intravenous iron therapy may also be effective.\n\n4.2.2. X-Linked Protoporphyria (XLPP)\n\nXLPP is a clinically indistinguishable X-linked form of EPP caused by gain-of-function mutations in ALAS2. This gain-of-function of ALAS2 increases protoporphyrin IX production in the context of normal FECH activity, the latter of which becomes rate-limiting and presumably leads to the onset of the EPP-like disease phenotype. In contrast to EPP, in XLPP the erythrocyte levels of both zinc protoporphyrin and free protoporphyrin are increased. This disease is similar but not identical to that described in Irp2 −/− mice, which are characterized by the overexpression of ALAS2 consequent to the loss of IRP2-dependent translational repression.\n\nMutations of ALAS2 include c.1706-1709 delAGTG (p.E569GfsX24) and c1699-1700 delAT (p.M567EfsX2), which result in frameshifts that cause replacement or deletion of 19-20 carboxy-terminal residues from ALAS2. Recently, the novel ALAS2 mutations c.1734 delG and c.1642 C >T (p.Q548X) have been identified. The treatment of XLPP is similar to that of the biochemically and phenotypically similar EPP.\n\n4.2.3. Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria (CEP)\n\nCEP is an autosomal recessive erythropoietic porphyria characterized by severe photosensitivity and hemolytic anemia. This disease results from a mutation in the UROS gene, and recent work has suggested that an accompanying gain-of-function mutation in ALAS2 could modify the disease severity. In addition, an X-linked form of CEP has been reported in which a trans-acting GATA-1-R216W mutation contributes to the onset of CEP.",

SCE-AA Mixture Enhances Mitochondrial Respiration in Hippocampal Neurons\n\nMitochondrial respiration is responsible for supplying the ATP necessary to sustain synapse formation and dendritic remodeling. Because schisandrin C is the predominant compound in SCE, as identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, and has been shown to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis in dental pulp, we tested the effects of SCE on mitochondrial respiration in hippocampal neurons (Figure S1). However, we found no change in the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in response to treatment with SCE alone (10 μg/mL) for 24 h (Figure 1A). It has been reported that combinations of plant metabolites exert synergistic activities, including enhanced antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we explored whether treatment with a mixture of SCE and AA synergistically altered mitochondrial respiration. As shown in Figure 1A,B, incubation of mHippoE-14 cells derived from the embryonic mouse hippocampus in media containing a mixture of SCE and AA (10 μg/mL, 4:1 ratio) for 24 h enhanced basal OCR, measured using an XF24 analyzer, increasing it by 33.7% compared with controls. Maximum respiration was also increased in the group treated with a mixture of SCE and AA (Figure 1A,B). We next examined the effect of different ratios of SCE and AA on OCR in hippocampal cells. We found that basal OCR increased significantly with increasing ratios of SCE, reaching the highest level at an SCE:AA ratio of 4:1. At mixing ratios of 1:4 and 2:3, the effect of SCE-AA mixtures was comparable to those of controls (Figure 1C,D). The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) showed a mild increase in groups of administration of the SCE-AA mixture, but it was also increased by treatment with AA only (Figure S2A,B). Furthermore, a different mixing ratio of SCE and AA increased ECAR with no pattern (Figure S2C,D). Unlike 24-h treatment, short-term treatment of mHippoE-14 cells with an SCE-AA mixture exerted effects on OCR and ECAR comparable to those observed in controls (Figure S3A,B). Taken together, these results suggest that the SCE-AA mixture has synergistic effects on mitochondrial respiration that depend on the proportion of SCE in the mixture. \n\n3.2. SCE-AA Mixture Improves Fear Learning and Memory in Mice\n\nIncreased mitochondrial respiration is known to produce cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection. To verify whether increased mitochondrial respiration in hippocampal neurons induced by an administration of an SCE-AA mixture (Figure 1) affects learning and memory in mice, we performed contextual and cued fear-conditioning tests. Hippocampal plasticity has been implicated in the regulation of fear learning and memory storage. In fear-conditioning tests, we assessed the hippocampal-dependent formation of contextual memory of an electric foot shock in mice by measuring freezing time; in all tests, the threshold for a freezing episode was set at 0.75 s (Figure 2A). In the fear-conditioning period, consisting of a 5-min habituation period and three trials of a 20-s tone and 1-s shock, with each trial separated by 1-min intervals (event 1), mice injected with the SCE-AA mixture spent 61.4% of the total testing time freezing compared with 47.4% for control mice; freezing time in mice injected with SCE or AA only was comparable to that of controls (Figure 2B). In the contextual fear memory test (event 2) performed 24 h after event 1, freezing behavior of mice was measured by tracking movement for 5 min without a stimulus in the same environment as that used for event 1. Subsequent cued fear-memory tests (event 3) were performed using the same 30-min tone as used in event 1. Freezing time, expressed as a percentage of total testing time, for mice in the SCE-AA mixture-injected group was 30.5% higher in event 2 and 17.4% higher in event 3 than in controls (Figure 2C,D). These data support the interpretation that the SCE and AA mixture increases freezing behavior induced not only by contextual fear memory but also cued fear memory, which is mediated by the hippocampus.\n\n3.3. Administration of SCE-AA Mixture Enhances Recognition Memory in Mice\n\nIt has been reported that lesions in the hippocampus or cortex lead to disruptions in object-recognition memory. The hippocampus is the region that stores and retrieves long-term recognition memory of an object; thus, object-recognition memory provides an index for assessing hippocampal function. To explore the effect of an SCE-AA mixture on object-recognition memory, we performed novel object-recognition (NOR) tests according to the schedule shown in Figure 3A. The NOR test is divided into two sessions. In session 1, two identical objects were placed equidistant from the center of the base of a cylinder-shaped box, and the time spent by mice in exploring these objects was recorded. In session 2, one of the two objects was replaced by a new object with a different shape and texture, and the test was repeated. Mice injected with a mixture of SCE and AA spent more time in exploration of the novel object compared with controls, as indicated in a heat map (Figure 3B). Specifically, the exploration time for the novel object compared with that for the familiar object increased by an average of 26.6 s in SCE-AA mixture-injected mice and 2.4",

Mice injected with a mixture of SCE and AA spent more time in exploration of the novel object compared with controls, as indicated in a heat map (Figure 3B). Specifically, the exploration time for the novel object compared with that for the familiar object increased by an average of 26.6 s in SCE-AA mixture-injected mice and 2.4 s in control mice (Figure 3C). An analysis of exploration times for novel and familiar objects, expressed as a percentage of the total exploration time during session 2 showed a 48.1% greater exploration time for novel objects than familiar objects for mice injected with a mixture of SCE and AA compared with 14.3% for control mice (Figure 3C). Collectively, these results suggest that an SCE-AA mixture significantly enhances hippocampal-dependent object-recognition memory.\n\n3.4. An SCE-AA Mixture Induces PSD95 Expression in the Hippocampus\n\nLearning and memory is regulated by interconnected neural networks and synaptic plasticity. Changes in the synaptic expression of neurotransmitter receptors, such as NMDA and AMPA (alpha-amino-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors, leads to alterations in plasticity. NMDA receptor NR2 subunits bind the scaffold protein PSD95. AMPA receptors, targets of the neurotransmitter glutamate at excitatory synapses, also associate with PSD95; among the subunits that constitute the AMPA receptor is GluR1. Because the SCE-AA mixture enhanced cognition in mice (Figure 2; Figure 3), we verified whether it also affected synaptic plasticity and/or the expression of excitatory or inhibitory synaptic molecules to regulate learning and memory. To this end, we extracted total protein from the hippocampus of mice injected with the SCE-AA mixture or SCE or AA alone after the NOR test and performed Western blot analyses to determine the synaptic protein expression level. We found a 3.3-fold increase in PSD95 protein level in the hippocampus of mice injected with the SCE-AA mixture compared with controls, as shown in Figure 4A,B. GluR1 expression was increased in the hippocampus of mice injected with either SCE or AA alone, as well as those injected with the mixture of SCE and AA (Figure 4C). In contrast, expression of the inhibitory synaptic proteins gephyrin and GAD65 was comparable in all groups (Figure 4D,E). It has been reported that BDNF, which stimulates neuron development and plasticity, increases PSD95 levels in dendritic spines. Therefore, we examined PSD95 protein levels in mice injected with a mixture of SE and AA, or SCE or AA alone. We found that administration of the SCE-AA mixture increased hippocampal BDNF levels by 7.2-fold compared with those in controls, or mice injected with SCE or AA only (Figure 4F,G). Modest increases in PSD95 and BDNF protein expression were observed in the frontal cortex of mice in the SCE-AA mixture-injected group (Figure S4). These results suggest that the SCE-AA mixture improves cognition in mice by stimulating expression of PSD95 protein and thereby regulating excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, and to a lesser extent in the frontal cortex. The findings further suggest that an increase in PSD95 is associated with BDNF induction and enhanced synaptic plasticity (Figure 5).",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nNongenetic factors\n\nThe application of the phenotype definition resulted in the identification of 21,967 cases and 103,282 controls that had complete data for all covariates. The covariates included in the final logistic regression model and carried forward to the GWAS analysis were (table S1) age at recruitment, sex, smoking status (anytime versus never), property ownership (own versus rent), body mass index (BMI), Townsend deprivation index at recruitment, adopted as a child, and long-standing illness, disability, or infirmity (yes or no).\n\nHigh alcohol consumption loci\n\nWe tested for SNP-level association with our high alcohol consumption phenotype in UKB. A total of 11,141,077 SNPs survived central quality control (QC) by UKB and post-GWAS filtering for imputation quality and minor allele frequency. The GWAS data test statistics showed modest deviation from the null (λGC = 1.09; Fig. 1, inset), although linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression intercept = 1.02 suggests most of the inflation is consistent with polygenic architecture. We then carried forward lead SNPs at P < 5 × 10−6 from UKB to Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging (GERA) for replication. We report validated associations that meet genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis of UKB and GERA, which also demonstrate nominal association with the same direction of effect in GERA (Table 1). A summary of all SNPs reaching P < 5 × 10−8 in UKB can be found in table S2. We identified six loci attaining genome-wide significant association with alcohol consumption after meta-analysis and meeting our criteria for replication: ADH1B (rs1229984; P_meta = 2.3 × 10−66); KLB (rs13130794; P_meta = 5.7 × 10−16); BTF3P13 (rs144198753; P_meta = 4.1 × 10−29); GCKR (rs1260326; P_meta = 1.5 × 10−13); SLC39A8 (rs13107325; P_meta = 6.7 × 10−9); and DRD2 (rs11214609; P_meta = 4.3 × 10−9) (Table 1).\n\nMultiple distinct signals of association observed at alcohol consumption loci\n\nConditional analyses revealed an additional signal (P < 1 × 10−5) (Table 2) at the SLC39A8 locus (NFKB1). Given ADH1B and BTF3P13 are located <1 Mb apart on q23 of chromosome 4, we conducted a wider conditional analysis across a 1.5-Mb region, which included both SNPs. The analysis identified eight independent SNPs mapping to/near ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH4, ADH5, TSPAN5, and EIF4E. The signal mapping to BTF3P13 did not meet locus-wide significance in conditional analysis, suggesting a false positive for this variant.\n\nPreviously reported loci\n\nThe signals described in this section meet our validated association criteria and have been reported for various alcohol phenotypes by other groups. The lead SNP at ADH1B, rs1229984 [risk allele frequency (RAF), 0.980; P = 3.3 × 10−36; fig. S1A], is the missense variant (G-->A; p.His48Arg) that has been widely replicated. The lead SNP rs13130794 (RAF, 0.632; P = 4.0 × 10−9; fig. S1B) is located in the KLB locus and has been reported to be associated with alcohol intake in the UKB and a separate European cohort of >98,000 individuals. The lead variant in chromosome 2, rs1260326 (RAF, 0.612; P = 2.6 × 10−8; fig. S1C), is in GCKR, a glucokinase regulatory gene. This specific SNP has been reported as genome-wide significant for alcohol consumption (i.e., drinks/week) in large-scale European ancestry and transethnic populations. The lead SNP rs13107325 (RAF, 0.928; P = 1.6 × 10−8; fig. S1D) is in the zinc transporter gene, SLC39A8, which has been linked in Europeans to AUD Identification Test (AUDIT) and AUDIT-C outcomes, and to AUD diagnosis. Last, rs11214609 (RAF, 0.395; P = 4.3 × 10−9; fig. S1E) was the SNP in the DRD2 locus. DRD2 often has been cited in addiction phenotypes and has been identified for AUD, but not alcohol consumption.\n\nNonreplicated signals reported elsewhere\n\nWe also observed genome-wide significant evidence of association in UKB at FTO and CRHR1, but these signals could not be validated in GERA. There is, however, evidence for association with alcohol-related phenotypes at these loci from other studies. The lead SNP rs55872725 (RAF, 0.599; P = 2.6 × 10−8) is in the FTO gene. This locus has recently been reported to be associated with AUDIT-C and AUD diagnosis in European ancestry individuals. Different index variants were reported between studies, rs62033408 for AUDIT-C and AUD diagnosis outcomes, but the SNPs are in strong LD with each other (r2 = 0.92).

Different index variants were reported between studies, rs62033408 for AUDIT-C and AUD diagnosis outcomes, but the SNPs are in strong LD with each other (r2 = 0.92). The FTO locus has been strongly associated with BMI, obesity, and, subsequently, type 2 diabetes as a clinical end point. Our lead SNP in this locus is in complete LD (r2 = 1.0) with rs1558902 in Europeans, which is the lead SNP for BMI in the largest published GWAS to date. The CRHR1 locus, with rs1635291 (RAF, 0.754; P = 4.5 × 10−10) as the lead SNP, has been identified through gene-based analysis in a previous alcohol consumption GWAS where never drinkers were excluded. However, no other groups have reported this locus directly through GWAS. Given the previous associations for these loci with covariates included in our analysis but not in the GERA dataset, we explored the potential for collider bias at rs55872725 when not adjusting for BMI, and rs1635291 when not adjusting for smoking; the results were consistent at 6.5 × 10−6 and 2.8 × 10−8, respectively. We also found our lead SNP in the CRHR1 locus to be in strong LD (r2 = 0.87) with a tag SNP rs1800547 for a common inversion polymorphism in 17q21.31.\n\nIn silico analysis\n\nOf the six validated variants from the UKB and GERA cohorts, three were identified as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) through the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database (table S3). rs11214609 showed evidence of being an eQTL in various tissues for nearby genes, ANNK1 and TTC12. rs13130794 was associated with the expression of RFC1 in the cerebellar hemisphere and skeletal muscle and UDGH in blood. rs1260326 was a broader eQTL with evidence across eight loci and various tissues including skeletal muscle, thyroid, and adrenal glands. Table S4 describes the LD between the top eQTL SNP for any eQTL signal and the GWAS SNP. None of the SNP pairs demonstrated evidence of colocalization based on a threshold of LD r2 > 0.8.\n\nThe validated SNPs were submitted to Gene ATLAS to explore phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) outcomes in disease phenotypes via International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Evidence suggests that these SNPs contribute to a range of diseases including alcohol dependence, hypertension, skeletal disorders, gout, alcoholic liver disease, ischemic heart diseases, metabolic disorder, obesity, and diabetes mellitus (table S5). The ADH1B variant is associated with lipid metabolism disorder, giving further link between alcohol intake and liver fat accumulation.\n\nA set of 37 loci, which reached 5 × 10−6 with heavy drinker status phenotype in UKB, were submitted to the Reactome Knowledgebase for pathway analysis (table S6). Six pathways across three distinct processes were found to be significant. The most prominent outcome related to signaling of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and PI3K/AKT pathways, particularly in reference to cancer. Dysfunction of the PI3K/AKT pathway is widely implicated in many cancers and is a key regulator of cell survival through downstream targets. The genes implicated in these pathways were KLB and ESR1 (fig. S2). The other two pathways were neurexins and neuroligins, driven by LRRTM4 and NRXN3, and TFAP2 (AP-2) family regulation of transcription of growth factors and their receptors, driven by ESR1.\n\nThrough genetic correlation analysis of the entire genome, we identified 21 significant correlations that survived multiple testing correction. These outcomes are summarized in Fig. 2. The traits with the strongest correlations included smoking variables [e.g., ever versus never smoked (rg = 0.48, PFDR = 2.60 × 10−13) and age of smoking initiation (rg = −0.41, PFDR = 0.006)], several lung cancer outcomes [e.g., squamous cell lung cancer (rg = 0.37, PFDR = 0.006) and lung cancer (rg = 0.36, PFDR = 1.20 × 10−4)], and mothers age at death (rg = −0.41, PFDR = 1.60 × 10−4). Several education measures and mental health conditions were also found to have significant correlations.\n\nMendelian randomization (MR) was used to examine the causal relationship between our heavy drinker case-control phenotype and 111 selected traits and clinical outcomes. The number of SNPs used for instrumental variables for each outcome test varied between two and six. Twelve outcomes including four insulin-related and two lung cancer outcomes demonstrated nominal significance using the inverse variance–weighted (IVW) method, although only evidence of a protective effect for ischemic stroke survived multiple testing correction (table S7). The MR-Egger regression intercept demonstrated no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy for the 12 outcomes (P ≥ 0.11).

Given rs1229984 demonstrates a consistent and large effect size across genetic studies of alcohol-related phenotypes, it is questionable whether the outcome can be considered as truly representative for this disease.\n\nTo further explore the potential causal effect of heavy alcohol consumption on lung cancer outcomes and allow for potential pleiotropy that might be driven by smoking, we repeated our GWAS analysis stratified for smoking status (ever versus never) and performed MR to assess potential collider bias. The SNPs used as the instrumental variable in the original analysis were retained, and lung adenocarcinoma and lung cancer were the only outcomes investigated. Evidence of consistent outcomes was observed in both stratified groups using IVW, although lung cancer in never smokers was the only outcome that did not reach the statistical significance threshold (P = 0.085).\n\nFunctional effects in model organisms\n\nTo verify whether validated genetic targets (i.e., ADH1B, GCKR, SLC39A8, and KLB) had a conserved role in phenotypic responses to alcohol, we investigated the acute effects of ethanol on the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans. In comparison to wild-type animals, those with a loss-of-function mutation in the worm ortholog for ADH (sodh-1 in C .elegans) had a statistically enhanced ethanol response (Fig. 3) as has been previously described in detail. The effect of intoxicating ethanol on coordinated locomotion was next quantified for loss-of-function mutations in C. elegans glucokinase (GK; hxk-1) and solute carrier family 39 member 8 (SLC39A8; zipt-15) (Fig. 3). Without an ortholog for GCKR in C. elegans, we instead analyzed its downstream effector protein glucokinase itself. Loss-of-function mutations in these genes significantly reduced the effect of ethanol for GK and SLC39A8 (Fig. 3), underlining a conserved role for these genes in whole-animal responses to alcohol. We also quantified single mutations in the C. elegans orthologs for the β-Klotho protein (KLB; klo-1 and klo-2) and found that individual mutations did not alter the ethanol phenotype (fig. S3A). A compound mutation of both klo-1 and klo-2, however, did have a significantly enhanced ethanol effect (Fig. 3).\n\nTo validate the effects seen in individual mutant strains, we performed RNA interference (RNAi) experiments to knock down expression of the contraindicated genes. In comparison to control, RNAi knockdown of GK (hxk-1) and SLC39A8 (zipt-15) resulted in the same phenotypic effects as did the mutations (Fig. 4). In our RNAi experiments, knockdown of ADH (sodh-1) did not result in a significant decrease. Similar to the KLB mutations, individual knockdown of C. elegans KLB (klo-1 or klo-2) did not statistically enhance the ethanol phenotype and neither did knocking down both klo-1 and klo-2 simultaneously (Fig. 4). The lack of effect in the double knockdown is perhaps expected given that RNAi efficiency can be reduced with multiple targets. To validate the alcohol effect of KLB in C. elegans in an alternative method, we performed RNAi on individual KLB genes in the mutant strain of the other ortholog (i.e., klo-1 RNAi in the klo-2 background; klo-2 RNAi in the klo-1 background). In both cases, there were exceptionally enhanced effects of ethanol similar to that seen with the compound mutant strain (fig. S3B).",

There were no significant OPRM1 genotype group differences across demographic variables (p’s > 0.05). Results revealed significant genotype group differences across drinking variables, specifically AUDIT score, number of drinking days, and drinks per drinking day in the past 30 days. Table 1. All subsequent analyses controlled for these variables found to differ across OPRM1 genotype. Notably, coefficients did not change in statistical significance when comparing models including AUDIT score, drinking days, or drinks per drinking day as covariates. Therefore, all models included only drinking days as the representative covariate for OPRM1 genotype group differences in drinking. To further validate the main results, all analyses controlled for ALDH2 (rs671) and ADH1B (rs1229984) markers. Analyses of subjective response during the alcohol infusion session controlled for baseline (i.e. BrAC = 0.00 g/dl) levels of subjective response on the corresponding outcome variable.\n\nA series of Fisher’s exact tests, non-parametric tests accounting for small cell sizes, were conducted to examine 24 possible side effects from the medication as indicated by the SAFTEE checklist. Results revealed a significant association between medication and drowsiness, which occurred in 20% of participants while on naltrexone in comparison to 7% while on placebo (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.05). There was also a significant medication association on ringing in the ears, which occurred in 3% of participants when taking naltrexone in comparison to 1% while taking placebo (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.03). There were no significant medication associations on the remaining 22 side effects measured by the SAFTEE (Fisher’s exact test, p > 0.05), including nausea. There were also no significant differences in side effects as a function of OPRM1 genotype (Fisher’s exact test, p > 0.05).\n\nPharmacogenetic Effects: Alcohol Craving\n\nAnalyses of alcohol-induced craving revealed no simple effect of genotype (b = 0.20, SE = 0.21, t = 0.96, p = 0.34), medication (b = −0.15, SE = 0.17, t = −0.86, p = 0.39), or medication × genotype interaction (b = 0.15, SE = 0.21, t = 0.73, p = 0.47).

As expected, there was an effect of BrAC (b = 0.13, SE = 0.06, t = 2.10, p = 0.04), such that participants reported higher levels of alcohol craving across rising BrAC levels. Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = 0.02) and baseline AUQ values (p < 0.01). Current cigarette smoking status, defined using a binary variable (i.e., 0 = non-smoker and 1 = smoker), was not a significant moderator of any of these effects (p ≥ 0.28).\n\nPharmacogenetic Effects: Subjective Response to Alcohol\n\nAnalyses of alcohol-induced sedation revealed no simple effect of genotype (b = −0.11, SE = 0.37, t = −0.30, p = 0.77), medication (b = 0.14, SE = 0.23, t = 0.61, p = 0.55), or medication × genotype interaction (b = −0.21, SE = 0.29, t = −0.72, p = 0.47). There was not a significant three-way interaction across medication × genotype × BrAC (b = 0.28, SE = 0.21, t = 1.30, p = 0.19). There was an effect of BrAC (b = 0.30, SE = 0.15, t = 2.02, p = 0.04) with participants reporting greater sedation across rising BrAC levels. Significant covariates included ADH1B genotype (p = 0.01) and baseline sedation values (p < 0.01).

There was a significant main effect of genotype (F (1,71) = 5.79, p = 0.02) such that Asp40 carriers consumed significantly fewer drinks (mean = 0.80, SD = 1.27) in comparison to Asn40 homozygotes (mean = 1.51, SD = 1.49). There was no significant medication × genotype interaction (F (1,70) = 0.68, p = 0.41). Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = .05). Smoking status was trending towards predicting greater self-administration (F(1,68)=3.87, p = 0.053), such that non-smokers consumed 0.83 (SD = 1.27) drinks versus 1.41 (SD = 1.50) for smokers. Smoking status did not moderate or affect any medication or genotype effects (p ≥ 0.25).\n\nThe distribution of latency to first drink was non-normal. Collapsed across medication conditions and genotype groups, 29% consumed their first drink immediately (within the first three minutes), 18% consumed their first drink at some point during the session (but not immediately), and 53% abstained during the entire session. Cox proportional regression models revealed no significant main effect of medication on latency to first drink (Wald χ2 = 2.58, p = 0.10, HR = .67); however, there was a significant main effect of genotype on latency to first drink (Wald χ2 = 3.39, p = 0.03, HR = 1.89) such that Asn40 homozygotes had a significantly shorter latency to first drink, Figure 4. When medication × genotype interaction was added to the models (Figure 5), the effect of genotype was no longer significant (p = 0.12) nor was the medication × genotype interaction (p = 0.63). There were no significant covariates across either model (p’s > 0.09). Smoking status was associated with marginally shorter latency to drink (Wald χ2 = 2.61, p = 0.07) but did not moderate the effects of genotype or medication (p ≥ 0.40).\n\nTreating OPRM1 genotype as a three-level variable did not significantly alter the pharmacogenetic results reported above.",

The GA group had the lowest levels in men, and the AA group had the lowest levels in women, but the difference between groups was not significant in women. The difference of distribution of age between the genotypes are significant and the GA genotype group were older than other genotypes in both sexes. And BMI differed according to the rs671 polymorphism significantly in men.\n\nTable 3 presents the results of the univariate and multivariate linear regression models in each sex. Daily alcohol consumption was positively associated with blood cortisol levels in the univariate model in both sexes. After adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and education status, the strength of the association between daily alcohol consumption and blood cortisol level was similar to the results of the univariate analysis in men but was higher in women.\n\nTable 4 shows the association between the genetically predicted alcohol consumption and blood cortisol level in each sex. The MR results except for ex-drinkers, are presented as a sensitivity analysis. In men, all models showed a positive association of genetically predicted daily alcohol consumption and blood cortisol level. In the MR analysis, the genetically predicted one standard drink/day increases cortisol by 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21–0.51). In sensitivity analysis genetically predicted one standard drink/day elevates cortisol by 0.27 (95% CI, 0.14–0.41). However, there was no significant association between alcohol and cortisol in all models for women.",

    "content": "Results\n\nCharacteristics of study population\n\nA total of 1026 individuals, including 699 males and 507 females, were enrolled in this study. The average age of the participants was 76.64 ± 6.40 years (range, 65–94 years) and all were from an elderly Beijing community-dwelling population. The prevalence of HUA was 14.71% in the study population, with 151 HUA cases and 1055 controls. Table 1 indicates that individuals in the HUA group had higher levels of serum creatinine, TG, LDL, and BMI, but lower levels of HDL, compared to controls (p < 0.05). The percentage of hypertensive patients in the HUA cases was also higher compared to the control group (47.7% vs 38.8%, p = 0.041), but there was no significant difference in SBP and DBP between the two groups, which may be related to hypertension treatment (e.g., 31.8% of the HUA cases and 18.8% of the controls, p = 4.9 × 10− 5). However, the ratio of diuretics was relatively low and did not reach statistical significance between the two groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference in FBG, alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, or history of diabetes between the case and control groups. \n\nDistribution of ABCG2, SLC2A9, and SLC22A12 polymorphisms between two groups\n\nThe three tested SNPs (SLC2A9 rs3733591, ABCG2 rs2231142, and SLC22A12 rs893006) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.30, 0.70, and 0.33, respectively). The genotype and allele frequencies of these three SNPs are shown in Table 2 and stratified by gender. In the general population, the genotype frequencies of ABCG2 rs2231142 among HUA cases were 11.9% (T/T), 53.6% (T/G), and 34.4% (G/G), respectively, while the genotype frequencies were 8.0% (T/T), 40.4% (T/G), and 51.7% (G/G) in the controls, respectively. The minor T allele of the ABCG2 variants reached 28.2% in the controls and 38.7% in the HUA cases. The distribution of ABCG2 variants showed statistical significance in males and when combining males and females for the Chi-square test, there was no significant association in females (p = 0.053). The distribution of SLC2A9 rs3733591 was only significantly different in females (p = 0.003), with a frequency of 17.8% for C/C and 52.1% for C/T in the HUA cases. There was no significant difference in genotype frequency of SLC22A12 rs893006 between HUA cases and controls in both males and females. \n\nAssociation between risk alleles of uric acid genes with sUA levels and HUA risk\n\nIn all samples, there was a significant association of increased sUA levels (μmol/L) with each copy of risk allele of the three SNPs (Beta = 0.08, p = 0.002 in rs3733591 SLC2A9, Beta = 0.16, p = 6.75 × 10− 9 in rs2231142 ABCG2, Beta = 0.07, p = 0.006 in rs893006 SLC22A12; Table 3). There was also a significant association HUA with the risk alleles of these three SNPs [OR (95% CI): 1.34 (1.03–1.74), p = 0.029 in rs3733591 SLC2A9, OR (95% CI): 1.63 (1.27–2.11), p = 1.65 × 10− 4 in rs2231142 ABCG2]; however, there was no significant association of HUA with SLC22A12 rs893006 variants [OR (95% CI): 1.33 (0.99–1.78), p = 0.061]. After we separated the subjects by gender, the T allele of rs2231142 ABCG2 was associated with sUA level and HUA in both males and females (all p < 0.05), but the C risk allele in rs3722591 SLC2A9 was only associated with sUA level and HUA in females. The SLC22A12 rs893006 G risk allele was only associated with sUA level in males. \n\nAssociation between different genotypes of three SNPs and sUA level\n\nsUA level (μmol/L) was associated with the ABCG2 rs2231142 polymorphism in all populations (T/T: 337.46 ± 71.25, T/G: 317.51 ± 80.53, G/G: 287.46 ± 75.13; p = 6.98 × 10− 8) and sUA levels of the G/G genotypes were significantly lower compared with those of the T/T genotypes (p = 4.40 × 10− 6). There was also a significant difference in sUA levels in the G/G and T/T male carriers (G/G vs. T/T: 313.32 ± 73.83 vs",

There was also a significant difference in sUA levels in the G/G and T/T male carriers (G/G vs. T/T: 313.32 ± 73.83 vs 348.20 ± 68.85; p = 0.003) and female carriers (G/G vs T/T: 276.18 ± 71.65 vs 323.32 ± 72.67; p = 2.67 × 10− 4). The sUA level was higher in SLC2A9 C/C carriers of the whole population and females compared with T/T carriers (p = 0.005 and 0.015, respectively), but there was no association in male subjects. There was also no significant difference in sUA levels between each genotype of the SLC22A12 rs893006 polymorphism analyzed using the posthoc Bonferroni test (Table 4). \n\nAssociation of sUA levels and genetic risk scores\n\nThe genetic risk score of an individual was generated by counting the number of risk alleles of high sUA levels in the study population, ranging from 0 to 6 (C allele of SLC2A9 rs3733951, T allele of ABCG2 rs2231142, and G allele of SLC22A12 rs893006; Fig. 1). Using linear regression analysis, we found that the mean sUA level in both males and females significantly increased with the number of risk alleles (Beta = 0.17, p = 6.24 × 10− 7 in males and Beta = 0.20, p = 7.39 × 10− 7, respectively). In the whole population, the mean sUA level also increased linearly with the number of risk alleles (Beta = 0.18, p = 1.94 × 10− 12). \n\nAssociation between rs2231142 ABCG2 variants and HUA risk according to cardiovascular risk factors\n\nTable 5 summarizes the association between ABCG2 rs2231142 polymorphisms and HUA risk with or without cardiovascular risk factors. In all study populations, the OR of HUA with each copy of the T allele in rs2231142 increased significantly when accounting for cardiovascular risks (such as obesity, hypertension, higher levels of TG and LDL, and lower levels of HDL) compared to those without cardiovascular risk factors. The OR of HUA with high TG levels and low HDL levels had a strong increase in HUA risk associated with each copy of T alleles in 2,231,142 in males (OR (95% CI): 2.41 (1.06–4.53), p = 0.035 and OR (95% CI): 2.50 (1.12–5.67), p = 0.026, respectively). Among females, the association was statistically significant in individuals with obesity [OR (95% CI): 1.59 (1.04–3.04); p = 0.045], hypertension [OR (95% CI): 1.83 (1.09–3.08); p = 0.021], and high TG levels [OR (95% CI): 2.57 (1.10–6.01); p = 0.030] and LDL levels [OR (95% CI): 1.98 (1.20–3.34); p = 0.008] compared with those with non-cardiovascular risk factors, but not those with low HDL levels (p = 0.156). \n\nWe further assessed the association between cardiovascular risk factors and HUA risk or sUA levels among the ABCG2 rs2231142 T allele carriers (Table 6). BMI and TG levels were associated with higher sUA levels (Beta = 0.21, p = 3.40 × 10− 8 and Beta = 0.24, p = 6.18 × 10− 9, respectively) in the whole population, and this association was also significant in males (Beta = 0.23, p = 1.14 × 10− 5 for BMI and Beta = 0.25, p = 8.95 × 1 0− 6 for TG level, respectively) and females (Beta = 0.20, p = 0.002 for BMI and Beta = 0.24, p = 4.00 × 10− 4 for TG level, respectively). The association of BMI and TG level with HUA risk was also significant in males [OR (95% CI) = 2.01 (1.62–2.50); p = 1.75 × 10− 10 and OR (95% CI) = 1.88 (1.28–2.74); p = 0.001, respectively] and females [OR (95% CI): 1.22 (1.08–1.37); p = 0.001and OR (95% CI): 1.95 (1.26–2.55); p = 0.003, respectively].

    "content": "Results\n\nIdentification of Loci Associated with Kidney Function across Ancestry Groups\n\nWe identified 20 loci attaining genome-wide-significant evidence of association with eGFR (p < 5 × 10−8) in trans-ethnic meta-analysis (Table 1, Figure S2). These loci have been previously reported in ethnic-specific GWASs of individuals with European and East Asian ancestry (Table S4). They include two loci discovered in a recently published meta-analysis of European ancestry GWASs: LRP2 ([MIM: 600073] rs57989581, p = 5.6 × 10−10) and NFATC1 ([MIM: 600489] rs8096658, p = 1.3 × 10−8). Previously reported lead SNPs at an additional 21 established kidney-function loci attained nominal evidence of association (p < 0.05) with eGFR, with consistent direction of effect (Table S4).\n\nAs expected, lead SNPs were common across ancestry groups at all 20 loci, with each displaying modest effects on eGFR (Table S5). Despite substantial variability in allele frequencies between ancestry groups, we observed no evidence of trans-ethnic heterogeneity in allelic effects on eGFR for any lead SNP (Table 1, Table S5). Through conditional analyses (Table S6), we observed no evidence of multiple distinct signals of association for eGFR at any locus (pCOND < 10−5, Bonferroni correction for ∼5,000 variants per locus). Taken together, these data are consistent with a single variant driving association signals in each locus; each variant is shared across ancestry groups and has homogeneous effects on eGFR in diverse populations. However, we recognize that larger multi-ethnic samples will be required to detect lower frequency, population-specific distinct association signals of modest effect on kidney function.\n\nImpact of Lead eGFR SNPs on CKD and Kidney Function in Diabetic Individuals\n\nWe assessed the impact on CKD of lead SNPs at the 20 eGFR loci in a subset of individuals (up to 3,976 cases and 55,904 controls) contributing to our trans-ethnic meta-analysis (Table S7). We defined CKD by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or incidence of ESRD. For all 20 lead SNPs, the eGFR-decreasing allele was associated with increased risk of CKD. Eleven of the lead SNPs demonstrated evidence of association with CKD at nominal significance (p < 0.05), and the strongest signals were observed at UNCX (rs62435145, p = 2.2 × 10−7), ALMS1 ([MIM: 606844] rs7587577, p = 3.1 × 10−6), and PDILT-UMOD ([MIM: 191845] rs77924615, p = 4.0 × 10−6).\n\nWe also investigated the impact of the lead SNPs on eGFR in GWASs of individuals with diabetes for whom there are different mechanisms for loss of renal function, such as diabetic nephropathy. We obtained association summary statistics for eGFR in 13,158 subjects of European ancestry with diabetes (9,197 with T2D and 3,961 with T1D) from the SUMMIT Consortium (Table S8). Consistent with previous reports, allelic effects on eGFR in diabetic individuals and our trans-ethnic meta-analysis of individuals from the general population were homogeneous (Figure S3). There was nominal evidence of association with eGFR (p < 0.05), with the same direction of effect, at seven loci, and the strongest signals were observed at PDILT-UMOD (p = 6.9 × 10−6), PRKAG2 ([MIM: 602743] p = 0.00013) and NFATC1 (p = 0.00045).\n\nFine Mapping of eGFR Loci\n\nWe next sought to localize variants driving eGFR association signals in each of the 20 loci attaining genome-wide significance in our trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We utilized trans-ethnic fine mapping implemented in MANTRA, taking advantage of increased sample size and the expectation that patterns of LD vary between diverse populations. We derived credible sets of variants mapping within 500 kb of the lead SNP at each locus that together account for 99% of the posterior probability (πC) of driving the association signal (Table S9). Smaller credible sets, in terms of the number of SNPs they contain, or the genomic interval that they cover, thus correspond to more precise fine-mapping. The 99% credible set at the PDILT-UMOD locus included a single variant (rs77924615, πC>0.999), which maps to an intron of PDILT. This variant has previously been reported as driving the primary association signal for CKD at the PDILT-UMOD locus through whole-genome sequencing and long-range haplotype imputation into 194,286 Icelandic individuals with serum creatinine measurements. We also observed precise localization, defined by a 99% credible set including no more than five variants (Table S10), at a five additional loci: NFATC1 (two variants, mapping to 0.4 kb), SLC34A1 ([MIM: 182309] two variants, mapping to 0.6 kb), GCKR ([MIM: 600842] three variants, mapping to 11.7 kb), DCDC5-MPPED2 ([MIM: 612321",

Across all 20 loci, only 5.4% of the posterior probability of driving association signals was annotated to coding variants (Table S11), the majority of which was accounted for by GCKR p.Pro446Leu (rs1260326, πC = 0.938). This missense variant has been shown, functionally, to result in increased de novo triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis and export and decreased plasma glucose concentrations, all of which have been associated with risk of CKD, making GCKR the likely effector transcript for eGFR at this locus. However, outside of the GCKR locus, variants mapping to non-coding sequence accounted for more than 99.4% of the probability of driving eGFR association, suggesting that these signals are most likely to be mediated by effects on gene regulation.\n\nWe next investigated whether genomic annotations of regulatory chromatin state for 93 cell types, DHSs for 145 cell types, and ChIP-seq binding sites for 165 transcription factors were predictive of posterior probability of driving association signals across the 20 loci (Figure 1, Table S12). We observed significant effects (p < 0.00012, Bonferroni correction for 403 annotations) on posterior probability for variants in kidney DHSs, including adult renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs; p = 3.4 × 10−8), renal cortical epithelial cells (HRCEs; p = 4.7 ×10−7), and fetal kidney cells (p = 8.8 × 10−6). We also observed significant effects on posterior probability for transcription-factor binding sites, most notably for HDAC8 (p = 1.1 × 10−14). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in kidney function and development, and HDAC inhibitors could be promising in the treatment of kidney disease. We repeated our analyses by using fGWAS (Figure S4, Table S12) and observed strong correlation in the ranking of enriched annotations (r2 = 0.93). These results highlight that variants driving association signals with eGFR are more likely to be co-localized with annotated elements in kidney cells, thereby suggesting that gene regulation in disease-relevant tissues is a likely mechanism by which GWAS loci impact CKD.\n\nLead SNPs that, by themselves, accounted for more than 80% of the posterior probability of driving association signals overlapped an enriched annotation at five loci (Table S13). In particular, at the SLC34A1 locus, rs35716097 (πC = 0.946) overlapped DHSs in RPTECs and HRCEs, as well as a binding site for HDAC8, while at the NFATC1 locus, rs8096658 (πC = 0.877) overlapped fetal kidney cell DHSs (Figure S5). At both of these loci, the lead SNPs were also expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for NFATC1 and RGS14 (MIM: 602513; at the SLC34A1 locus) in multiple tissues (Table S13), highlighting these genes as likely effector transcripts through which eGFR association signals are mediated. NFATC1 plays a central role in inducible gene transcription during immune response and is a downstream target of the transplant immunosuppression drug cyclosporine A. RGS14 encodes a member of the regulator of G protein signaling family, which modulates downstream effects of Gα subunits and has unknown function in kidneys.\n\nExperimental Data in Model Organisms\n\nTo provide insight into the role of NFATC1 and RGS14 (at the SLC34A1 locus) in kidney physiology, we examined the function of ancestral orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila genome encodes a single member of the NFAT family, and a previous report has demonstrated that flies with NFAT loss-of-function mutations have increased salt sensitivity, suggesting a role for this gene in ionic or osmotic regulation. The closest RGS14 ortholog in Drosophila melanogaster is loco, for which reduced expression is associated with longer lifespan and stress resistance. We thus conducted experiments aimed at characterizing a role for loco loss-of-function variants in salt sensitivity. We compared survival of two independently derived heterozygous loco mutants (y1w1; locod06164/+ and y1w1; locoEY-P283/+) with isogenic y1w1 controls after supplementing their diet with varying NaCl concentrations for 8 days (Figure 2). There was very little mortality of any of the genotypes on non-NaCl-supplemented food,",

There was very little mortality of any of the genotypes on non-NaCl-supplemented food, indicating no baseline differences in viability over the time period tested. However, we observed significantly improved survival of the heterozygous loco mutants over controls on NaCl-supplemented food (Figure 2, Table S14), thereby indicating a role for this gene in resistance to salt stress. To exclude the effects of inbreeding depression on our findings, we also repeated our experiments with the same strains on a heterogenic background. As expected, the hybrid heterogenic strains were less salt susceptible than the isogenic strains, but the loco mutants remained salt-resistant when compared to controls of a similar genetic background (Figure 2, Table S14).\n\nTo further investigate the role of NFATC1 and RGS14 in kidney function, we used the 129S6 mouse strain that is salt-sensitive and susceptible to glomerulosclerosis. We compared the renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 and Rgs14 at baseline versus (1) after a 2-week exposure to high-salt diet and (2) at 12 weeks after CKD induced by sub-total nephrectomy. Compared to baseline condition, Rgs14 was significantly decreased (∼75%, p = 0.01) during high-salt exposure (Figure 3). In the CKD model, Rgs14 expression was also reduced and approached statistical significance (p = 0.06). The renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 was also significantly decreased (∼50%, p = 0.03) during high-salt exposure and trended down in CKD (p = 0.31). Although we cannot establish cause and effect, these data illustrate that the expression of both genes is altered during disease states.",

Liquid-Liquid Chromatography Separation of Sesquiterpene Lactones from Ferula penninervis Methanolic Root Extract\n\nTo date, numerous sesquiterpene lactones have been isolated from the roots of F. penninervis. However, all the previous separation studies have been carried out with the use of conventional preparative chromatographic procedures, such as thin layer chromatography, column chromatography or gel permeation chromatography, which are known to be solvent and time consuming. Support-free liquid-liquid chromatography (LLC), commonly referred as countercurrent chromatography (CCC) and centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), is considered a hybrid technique between liquid-liquid extraction (due to its partitioning separation mechanisms and high loading capacity) and solid-liquid chromatography (due to its very high selectivity). The ‘column’ in LLC is mounted either on a single axis rotor (in CPC) or double axis rotor (in CCC) and it is subjected to a centrifugal field that allows the stationary liquid phase to be kept inside the column, while the mobile liquid phase, immiscible with the first one, is pumped through it. Since there is no solid sorbent, no irreversible adsorption can practically occur, whereas the costs of purification are relatively low, as expensive solid stationary phases, time intensive column packing procedures or high-purity solvents are not required. The tailor-made mannerly preparation of the biphasic solvent systems as well as the numerous operating mode possibilities (classical ascending or descending elution, gradient elution, extrusion elution, recycling elution, continuous elution, (multiple) dual mode elution) make LLC a highly versatile and adaptable separation technique.\n\nIn order to achieve a successful purification of target compounds using LLC, a careful selection of the biphasic solvent system is required. Its suitability is quickly pre-evaluated by assessing the partition coefficient (Pi) values and the separation factors (αij). Pi (defined as the ratio between the concentration of the target in the stationary phase and that in the mobile phase) is considered to be optimum within the range of 0.4–2.5, whereas good separation factors (αij = Pi/Pj, Pi > Pj) should be higher than 1.5. Various mixtures of HEMWat have been successfully used for the LLC separation of several sesquiterpene lactones, such as eupalinolides A-B from Eupatorium lindleyanum DC. and lactucopicrin from Cichorium glandulosum Boiss. et Huet.. Therefore, for the seven target constituents from the roots of F. penninervis (Figure 1) which were previously shown to be rich in sesquiterpene lactones, four different HEMWat systems were screened (Table 1).\n\nSince suitable Pi values (between 0.44 and 1.89) were provided only with HEMWat 3/2/3/2 (v/v/v/v), the LLC separations were performed with this solvent composition. After four repeated experiments on a CCC unit (under the experimental conditions described in Figure 2), five fractions were yielded, as follows: Fr. A (12.5 mg), Fr. B (9.7 mg), Fr. C (4.2 mg), Fr. D (8.8 mg) and Fr. E (4.9 mg). After checking the UV spectral purity of all collected fractions by HPLC-DAD, it was noticed that Fr. A contained a 5:1 mixture of compounds 1 and 2, Fr. B contained compound 3 (95.7%), Fr. C contained compound 4 (95.4%), Fr. D contained a 5:2 mixture of compounds 5 and 6 and Fr. E contained compound 7 (98.4%). The fact that compounds 1–2 and 5–6 were not resolved under the LLC experimental conditions was expected from their separation factors α21 = 1.1 and α65 = 1.0 (Table 1). Hence, Frs. A and D were further purified by semi-preparative HPLC, under isocratic elution with 45% and 55% methanol, respectively, yielding 5.9 mg of compound 1 (98.7%), 1.0 mg of compound 2 (95.1%), 3.1 mg of compound 5 (98.0%) and 1.3 mg of compound 6 (91.1%). Thus, three of the seven target compounds were directly afforded with satisfactory purities at the end of the LLC processing steps. Additionally, for the purification of the other four targets, solid-liquid chromatography (namely preparative HPLC) was complementarily employed.\n\n2.2. Structure Elucidation of the New Guaiane-Type Sesquiterpene Lactones\n\nTwo new and five known guaiane-type sesquiterpene lactones (Figure 3 and Figure S1) were isolated from F. penninervis methanolic root extract. The known compounds were identified as olgin (1), laferin (3), olgoferin (4), oferin (5) and daucoguainolactone F (7) by comparing their spectral data with those reported in spectral libraries and literature.\n\nCompound 2 had a protonated ion [M + H]+ at m/z 391.1773 (calcd. for C21H27O7+, m/z 391.1751, Δ = 5.62 ppm), as detected by HRMS in positive ionization mode.

The ESI-MS/MS fragment ions at m/z 331.1561 [M–acetyl–H2O + H]+, 261.1134 [M–acetyl–ibutyroyl–H2O + H]+ and 243.1031 [M–acetyl–ibutyroyl–2 × H2O + H]+ suggested the presence of one acetyl and one isobutyroyl group attached to a guaiane-type sesquiterpene lactone skeleton (Figure S2). The NMR data of compound 2 (Table 2, Figures S3–S8) showed close similarities with olgin (1), except that the methacrylate group present in the C-8 position of olgin was replaced by an isobutyryl group [δH 2.61 (1H, hept, J = 7.0 Hz, H-8b), 1.21 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz, H-8d), and 1.24 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz, H-8c)]. It was confirmed by the HMBC correlation from H-8b and H-8 at δH 5.60 (1H, td, J = 10.9, 3.3 Hz, H-8) to C-8a (δC 177.3). The ROESY correlations from H-5 at δH 3.94 (1H, d, J = 11.4 Hz, H-5) to H-8 and H-13 at δH 1.61 (3H, s, H-13) and from H-6 at δH 4.69 (1H, t, J = 11.4, 9.7 Hz, H-6) to H-7 at δH 3.63 (1H, dd, J = 10.9, 9.7 Hz, H-7) indicated that the relative configuration was the same than olgin. Based on these findings, the new compound 2 was assigned as 2-oxo-8α-isobutyroyloxy-11α-acetoxy-5βH,6αH,7αH-gua-1(10),3-diene-6,12-olide (ferupennin P, Figure 3).\n\nThe HRMS (positive ionization mode) spectrum of compound 6 (Figure S9) showed a molecular ion [M + H]+ at m/z 419.2066 (calcd. for C23H31O7+, m/z 419.2064, Δ = 0.48 ppm). The ESI-MS/MS fragment ions at m/z 349.1636 [M–ibutyroyl+H]+, 331.1534 [M–ibutyroyl–H2O + H]+, 261.1118 [M–2×ibutyroyl–H2O + H]+ and 243.1015 [M–2 × i-But–2 × H2O + H]+ suggested the presence of two isobutyroyl groups attached to the same guaiane-type sesquiterpene lactone skeleton as in compound 2. The NMR data of compound 6 (Table 2, Figures S10–S14) confirmed the presence of two isobutyryl groups, the first one at δH 2.60 (1H, hept, J = 6.9 Hz, H-8b), 1.23 (3H, d, J = 6.9 Hz, H- 8c), and 1.20 (3H, d, J = 6.9 Hz, H-8d), and the second one at δH 2.60 (1H, hept, J = 6.9 Hz, H-11b), 1.20 (3H, d, J = 6.9 Hz, H-11c), and 1.19 (3H, d, J = 6.9 Hz, H-11d). The HMBC correlation from H-8 at δH 5.60 (1H, td, J = 11.1, 3.3 Hz, H-8) and H-8b (or H-11b) to C-8a (or C-11a) at δC (177.3) confirmed that one of the isobutyryl group was linked to C-8. The second one was linked to the remaining oxygenated carbon as indicated by the chemical shift of C-11 (δC 79.3) and the HMBC correlation from methyl at δH 1.61 (3H, s, H-13) to C-11, C-7 at δC (48.8) and C-12 at δC (175.6). The ROESY correlations were the same as those observed for the whole series of isolated compounds. The new compound 6 was assigned as 2-oxo-8α,11α-diisobutyroyloxy-5βH,6αH,7αH-gua-1(10),3-diene-6,12-olide (ferupennin Q, Figure 3).\n\n2.3. Effects on Gastrointestinal,",

Effects on Gastrointestinal, Prostate and Skin Cancer and Non-Cancer Cell Viability\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide after cardiovascular diseases, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Colorectal (1.80 million cases), prostate (1.28 million cases), skin (non-melanoma, 1.04 million cases) and stomach (1.03 million cases) carcinomas are among the most common types of cancer. Aside from radiotherapy, surgery and immunotherapy, chemotherapy is still the main cornerstone in cancer management. Furthermore, over 60% of the currently used anti-cancer chemotherapeutics are represented by natural products, natural product botanicals, natural product derivatives or natural product mimics. In addition, plants have a long history of use in the treatment of cancer, although many of their efficiency claims are skeptically viewed due to the overall poor definition of cancer as a disease in the traditional medicinal context.\n\nSince one of the most prominent bioactivity features of the Ferula species is represented by their cytotoxicity against cancer cells, we initially assessed the in vitro cytotoxicity of F. penninervis methanolic root extract against cancer and non-cancer cell lines. The cell lines used in this study were derived from the gastrointestinal tract (gastric cancer N87 cells, colorectal cancer Caco-2 and HT-29 cells), prostate (prostate epithelial PNT2 cells, androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells, androgen-insensitive prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells), and skin (BJ fibroblasts, HaCaT keratinocytes, squamous cell cancer SCC-15 cells, malignant melanoma A375 and B16F10 cells). This panel of cell lines is commonly used to investigate new agents with potential gastrointestinal, prostate and skin anti-cancer activity.\n\n2.3.1. Cytotoxic Activity of Ferula penninervis Methanolic Root Extract\n\nThe viability of gastrointestinal cancer cells was concentration-dependently reduced over the range of 12.5–200 μg/mL (Figure 4A). At the highest tested concentration, the percentages of viable cells were decreased to 44.37 ± 1.52%, 36.91 ± 1.50% and 49.76 ± 2.83% in N87, Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, respectively. According to the calculated IC50 values, Caco-2 were the most sensitive cells (Table 3). The survival rates of prostate cancer cells also declined in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4B and Figure S15). At 200 μg/mL, F. penninervis methanolic root extract reduced DU145, LNCaP and PC3 cell viabilities to 56.02 ± 2.88%, 29.08 ± 1.63% and 32.64 ± 1.47%, respectively. However, reductions of the cell viability at lower concentrations were observed only for LNCaP cell lines (71.92 ± 4.64% cell viability at 50 μg/mL). Nevertheless, based on the IC50 values, LNCaP and PC3 were the most sensitive prostate cancer cells, with comparable IC50 values (Table 3).\n\nThe viability of non-cancer epithelial prostate PNT2 cells was not affected up to 100 μg/mL (viabilities >95%). However, at 200 μg/mL, a significant reduction of PNT2 cell viability to 59.46 ± 5.22% was observed (Figure 4D). The effects produced by the crude extract against skin cancer cells were more drastic, especially at higher concentrations (Figure 4C). At 200 μg/mL, A375, SCC-15 and B16F10 cell viabilities were decreased to 16.74 ± 1.70%, 8.96 ± 0.70% and 16.59 ± 2.14%, respectively. According to the IC50 values, the following decreasing order of activity was observed: SCC-15 > B16F10 > A375 cells (Table 3).\n\nOn the other hand, skin-derived non-cancer cells were influenced in different manners. Up to 100 μg/mL, the viability of HaCaT keratinocytes was not reduced to less than 87%; however, a concentration of 200 μg/mL reduced their viability to 26.51 ± 2.37% (Figure 4D); this might suggest a potential skin irritating effect at high doses. Nevertheless, the treatment of BJ fibroblasts with F. penninervis methanolic root extract (12.5–200 μg/mL) significantly increased the number of viable fibroblasts as compared to the vehicle control treated cells (Figure 4D); the fibroblast growth-stimulating activity of plant extracts could suggest their potential regenerative and anti-aging properties. Overall, our data are in agreement with previous reports that assessed the cytotoxic effects of other Ferula species (e.g., F. gummosa Boiss., F. szowitsiana DC., F. persica Willd., F. hezarlalezarica Ajani, F. hirtella Boiss., F. oopoda Boiss) against different panels",

For instance, the methanolic (80%) extracts of F. szowitsiana and F. hirtella exhibited IC50 values ranging from 36 μg/mL and 235 μg/mL against HT-29, MCF-7, A549 and HepG2 cells.\n\n2.3.2. Cytotoxic Activity of Guaiane-Type Sesquiterpene Lactones\n\nDespite the fact that the intrinsic cytotoxicity of the sesquiterpene lactone nucleus is already established, the effects of Ferula sesquiterpenes against cancer cells were scarcely reported in previous investigations. Therefore, olgin, laferin, olgoferin, oferin, ferupennin Q and daucoguaianolactone F were next assessed for their cytotoxicity against LNCaP cells in comparison to prostate epithelial PNT2 control cells. Among all the screened cell lines, the ones derived from the prostate were selected for this step, since the crude methanolic root extract of F. penninervis showed better selectivity in reducing the survival rates of the cancer cells (especially LNCaP cells) as compared to the non-cancer cells.\n\nAt 50 µg/mL, olgin and laferin reduced LNCaP cell viability to 43.10 ± 3.52% and 14.40 ± 1.69%, respectively, while the other tested compounds did not decrease the number of viable LNCaP cells to less than 63% at the same concentration (Figure 4E and Figure S16). The treatment with the positive control (5-FU, 5 μg/mL) showed a reduction of LNCaP cell viability to 50.65 ± 3.28%. The IC50 values were extracted only for olgin (31.03 ± 1.12 μg/mL) and laferin (23.26 ± 0.81 μg/mL), while the IC50 values of the remaining tested compounds were estimated as > 50 μg/mL. Moreover, olgin did not significantly affect the viability of non-cancer prostate epithelial PNT2 control cells (Figure 4F). In contrast, laferin reduced PNT2 cell survival to 53.85 ± 1.71% at the highest tested concentration (50 µg/mL), which might indicate a putative toxicity at high doses in non-cancer cells.\n\nGlobally, our results are in agreement with the very few reports that previously evaluated the cytotoxicity of Ferula sesquiterpenes. For instance, ferutinin isolated from F. tenuissima Hub.-Mor & Peşmen. exhibited cytotoxic activity against PC3 cells, with an IC50 value of 19.7 μM. In another study, the guaiane-type lactone dehydrooopodin isolated from F. oopoda (Boiss. & Buhse) Boiss. revealed significant cytotoxicity, with IC50 values of 5 and 15 µM against erythroleukemia K562 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. A eudesmane-type sesquiterperne lactone isolated for the first time by Suzuki et al. from F. varia (Schrenk) Trautv. showed a 4.6-fold more potent cytotoxicity against the multidrug-resistant nasopharynx epidermoid cancer KB-C2 cells (IC50 = 15.7 μg/mL) than against the drug sensitive cancer KB cells (IC50 = 72.8 μg/mL).\n\n2.4. Influence on Melanin Synthesis and Release in αMSH-Stimulated Melanoma B16F10 Cells\n\nProduced in the melanocytes and then released and transferred to keratinocytes, melanin is the main pigment of skin. However, abnormal production and accumulation of melanin due to excessive sun exposure can produce hyperpigmentation skin disorders such as melasma, senile lentigo or Riehl melanosis. Disruption of melanogenesis by depigmentation (skin-lightening) agents has been targeted for therapies or protection from hyperpigmentation disorders. Nevertheless, the currently available drugs, such as arbutin, hydroquinone or kojic acid, are banned in numerous countries, since they have been reported to cause permanent depigmentation, skin cancer or dermatitis. Therefore, there is a real need for discovering novel, safe and effective depigmentation agents.\n\nTo evaluate the effects of F. penninervis methanolic root extract and its isolated guaiane-type sesquiterpene lactones on the melanin synthesis and release, the melanin assay was carried out. For this purpose, the production of melanin in murine melanoma B16F10 cells was stimulated with αMSH. Indeed, the αMSH treatment induced a ~3fold increase in both melanin release in the conditioned medium and melanin content in the cell lysate as compared to non-treated cells (Figure 5A,B). Next, the treatment with the crude extract of F. penninervis (100 μg",

Indeed, the αMSH treatment induced a ~3fold increase in both melanin release in the conditioned medium and melanin content in the cell lysate as compared to non-treated cells (Figure 5A,B). Next, the treatment with the crude extract of F. penninervis (100 μg/mL) markedly decreased both the melanin release in the conditioned medium (to 26.97 ± 2.07% of αMSH+ control cells) and melanin content in the cell lysate (to 31.43 ± 8.47% of αMSH+ control cells, Figure 5A,B). In contrast to this, kojic acid (100 μg/mL), used as the positive control, only reduced the melanin release (35.88 ± 3.45% of αMSH+ control cells), but not the melanin content. Olgin, laferin, olgoferin and oferin significantly impaired the melanin release in the medium to 40.67 ± 5.75%–65.48 ± 2.12% of αMSH+ control cells; however, ferupennin Q and daucoguaianolactone F were found inactive. The following decreasing order of activity at 10 μg/mL was observed: olgoferin > laferin > olgin ~ oferin > daucoguaianolactone F > ferupennin Q. However, the melanin content was not significantly affected by any of the tested compounds. Our data could suggest that Ferula sesquiterpene lactones could primarily act as melanin release disrupting agents and not as melanin synthesis inhibitors. Furthermore, to exclude the possibility that the observed inhibitory effects on the melanin production might have resulted through a reduced number of viable cells, neutral red uptake assay at 72 h was performed (Figure 5C and Figure S17). Nevertheless, no treatment decreased the viability of B16F10 cells as compared to the negative control (αMSH-) cells. To our knowledge, there are no previous studies reporting the melanin production inhibitory potential of Ferula genus or isolated constituents. Nevertheless, the anti-melanogenic effects of different phytochemicals were repeatedly evidenced in various cell-based assays. For instance, Mustapha et al. showed that both the ethyl acetate leaf extract of Crataegus azarolus L. (12.5 μg/mL) and one of its main constituents, vitexin-2ʺ-O-rhamnoside (5 μM), decreased the production of intracellular melanin in B16F10 cells by threefold as compared to untreated cells. Measuring the melanin content and release in B16F10 cells was also used to prove the anti-melanogenic activity of piperlongumine derived from Piper longum L.. Piperlongumine (3 and 6 μM) had no inhibitory effects on the cell growth, but it significantly reduced the total melanin production by down-regulating the tyrosinase activity and expression of several pro-melanogenic proteins, such as tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), TRP2, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF).",

    "content": "Results\n\nSurveillance and Resistance\n\nOf 975 culture-confirmed Campylobacter infections in the study, 177 (18.2%) were infected with a quinolone-resistant isolate, whereas 3 (0.3%) isolates were erythromycin-resistant. Linked microbiologic and epidemiologic data were obtained from 678 (69.5%) patients. In total, 152 (22.4%) patients had been outside Denmark within 1 week before illness, whereas 526 (77.6%) were domestically acquired infections. The three erythromycin-resistant isolates were all C. coli, two of them were also quinolone-resistant, and these were both isolated from travelers returning to Denmark from Spain and Portugal, respectively.\n\nQuinolone resistance was significantly associated with the origin of infection: 76 (50.0%) of 152 infections among travelers returning to Denmark were quinolone-resistant whereas 52 (9.9%) of 526 of domestically infected patients were infected with a quinolone-resistant strain (p < 0.001) (Table 1). For both C. coli and C. jejuni, a significantly higher proportion of quinolone-resistant infections was found among patients who had been abroad in the week before onset of illness than among patients with domestically acquired infections (risk ratio [RR] 9.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 63.8, p = 0.004 and RR 4.9, CI 3.6 to 6.7, p < 0.001). A higher proportion of C. coli than C. jejuni infections were acquired abroad (48.3% compared with 21.3% of C. jejuni).\n\nForeign travel was associated with different prevalences of quinolone resistance, depending on destination (Table 2). No travelers returning from other Scandinavian countries hosted quinolone-resistant Campylobacter isolates, whereas travel to a number of regions and subregions, including southern Europe and Southeast Asia, was significantly associated with a high proportion of quinolone-resistant infections.\n\nC. jejuni infections and C. coli infections did not differ in severity, as assessed by frequency of diarrhea, blood in stool, abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, mean duration of illness, or admission to hospitals. However, the mean duration of illness was longer for the 86 patients with quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infections and a known duration of illness (median 13.2 days) than for the 381 patients with quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni infections and a known duration of illness (median 10.3 days, p = 0.001). The association with extended length of illness was independent of foreign travel. For domestically acquired infections, the mean duration of illness was 12.4 and 10.4 days for quinolone-resistant and quinolone-sensitive infections, respectively. For comparison, the mean duration of illness for travel-associated infections was 13.9 and 10.3 days for quinolone-resistant and quinolone-sensitive infections, respectively. For C. coli, no difference in mean duration of illness was observed between quinolone-resistant and quinolone-sensitive infections.\n\nCase-Comparison Study\n\nFrom December 1, 2001, to June 10, 2002, 42 patients were infected by quinolone-resistant C. jejuni isolates, and these patients were matched with 84 patients with quinolone-sensitive isolates. No patients were connected on epidemiologic grounds of a recognized outbreak. The patients with quinolone-resistant isolates had a mean age of 33 years (interquartile range 20–45 years), and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.2. For comparison, patients with quinolone-resistant isolates in the larger study, which were not included in the case-comparison study, had a mean age of 31 years (interquartile range 20–45 years), and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.3. No strains changed susceptibility category after being retested. However, one case-patient was shown to be co-infected with two C. jejuni strains with identical serotype and RiboGroup, but with different susceptibility patterns, i.e., one strain was clearly sensitive (MIC of quinolone = 2 mg/L), whereas the MIC of quinolone for the other one was 128 to >256 mg/L on multiple repeated testings. Subsequent nucleotide sequence analysis indicated a normal consensus sequence in the former and a Thr-86 to Ala-86 mutation and three silent mutations in gyrA in the latter. The patient had not been exposed to fluoroquinolones before stool specimen collection.\n\nRisk factors for a quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infection identified in the univariate analysis and in the multiple logistic regression analysis are presented in Table 3. According to the multiple logistic regression analysis, the only exposures independently associated with an increased risk for quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infection were foreign travel (OR = 16.81), eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey (OR = 19.10), and swimming (OR = 5.01). Eating fresh chicken (of presumably Danish origin) was associated with a decreased risk (OR = 0.04). Age group did not affect the findings (younger or older than 15 years of age) in either the univariate or the multiple logistic regression analysis.\n\nThe case-comparison study identified 12 quinolone-resistant cases that were domestically acquired. However, to determine the sources of infection for the domestically acquired quinolone-resistant infections, an unmatched subanalysis on domestically acquired infections (quinolone-resistant versus quinolone-sensitive) was performed. Infections treated with fluoroquinolones before specimen collection were excluded. In this model, the parameter estimates did not change substantially from the primary model, but because of the lower sample size, the confidence intervals increased, and only eating",

In this model, the parameter estimates did not change substantially from the primary model, but because of the lower sample size, the confidence intervals increased, and only eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey had p value <0.05. In 10 (11.9%) of 84 domestically acquired infections, patients reported eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey compared with 4 (9.5%) of 42 infections in persons with travel-related infections.\n\nOverall, we found information on antimicrobial drugs received by 122 of 126 patients. Forty patients (32.8%) were treated with antimicrobial agents for their campylobacteriosis; of these, 33 patients (27%) received a fluoroquinolone, 6 patients (4.9%) received a macrolide, and 1 patient (1%) received both a fluoroquinolone and a macrolide for the C. jejuni infection.\n\nCampylobacter Isolates from Retail Food Products and Broiler Chickens\n\nThe human isolates were included in a database and compared with 180 Campylobacter isolates obtained from retail food products (chicken [n = 139], turkey [n = 39], and pork [n = 2]) and 49 isolates from broiler chicken fecal samples obtained from the same geographic area and time period as the human isolates. Most (63%) food isolates were from Danish-bred food animals; the remaining isolates were from imported food from France (n = 48), Italy (n = 7), and the United Kingdom (n = 9). The origin of three chicken isolates was unknown. Of 180 isolates obtained from food products of both domestic and foreign origin, 153 (85%) isolates and 27 (15%) isolates were C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively (Table 1). Thirteen (8.5%) of 153 C. jejuni isolates and 8 (29.6%) of 27 C. coli isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid. Three (2.0%) of 153 C. jejuni isolates and 5 (18.5%) of 27 C. coli isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Two isolates (one C. jejuni and one C. coli) from domestic chicken products were resistant to both antimicrobial agents. A subanalysis of resistance status by origin of 139 retail chicken products (domestic versus imported) showed that 7 (8.0%) of 87 C. jejuni isolates and three (60%) of five C. coli isolates from domestic raised chicken products were resistant to nalidixic acid. Of isolates from imported chicken products, 5 (14.7%) (3 isolates from France and 2 isolates from the United Kingdom) of 34 C. jejuni isolates and 1 (10%) (from France) of 10 C. coli isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid.\n\nOf 49 isolates from broiler chicken fecal samples, 39 (79.6%) were C. jejuni and 10 (20.4%) were C. coli (Table 1). Two isolates (4.1%) (both C. jejuni) were nalidixic acid–resistant; one was also erythromycin-resistant. Five (10.2%) isolates (four C. jejuni, one C. coli) were erythromycin-resistant.\n\nSerotyping and Molecular Subtyping of Isolates\n\nWe found 133 combinations of serotypes and RiboGroups (hereafter subtypes) among 496 typed isolates (10 isolates were not tested or nontypeable) from domestically acquired C. jejuni infections (Table 4). Eighteen (13.5%) subtypes were identified exclusively among quinolone-resistant isolates, 102 (76.7%), exclusively among quinolone-sensitive isolates, and 13 (9.8%) among both resistant and sensitive isolates.\n\nFive of 11 subtypes of quinolone-resistant C. jejuni found among isolates from retail food products, broiler chickens, or both were also found among quinolone-resistant domestically acquired C. jejuni isolates from humans, and 34 of 88 subtypes of quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni found among isolates from retail food products, broiler chickens, or both were also found among quinolone-sensitive domestically acquired C. jejuni isolates from humans.\n\nPatients with domestically acquired quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni infections were more likely to have a C. jejuni subtype that was also identified among retail food products and broiler chickens than were patients with domestically acquired quinolone-resistant infections (270 of 444 vs. 15 of 51, RR = 2.07, CI 1.34 to 3.18, p < 0.001).",

However, due to additional missing data for parental education (n = 65), linguistic acculturation (n = 2), and on one of the SNPs of interest (rs4938056; n = 2), the final sample size available for the multivariable analyses was 1064.\n\nDemographic characteristics and psychosocial risk factors of study participants are shown in Table 1. The cohort was evenly split by gender, the mean age of participants was 14.4 years (SD = 1.03), and overall, the mean social disinhibition score was very close to the middle of the range of values (3.3; SD = 1.9). Males had a significantly higher mean social disinhibition score than females (F = 34.4, df = 1, P ≤ 0.001). Age was also significantly associated with mean social disinhibition score (F = 13.7, df = 5, P < 0.001); youth ≥14 years of age had higher mean scores than youth 12 or 13 years of age.\n\nYouth with at least one parent who had completed high school or had attained additional education past high school reported higher mean social disinhibition scores compared with youth whose parents did not graduate high school (F = 5.2, df = 2, P = 0.006). The mean linguistic acculturation score for the cohort was 3.5 (SD = 0.9); participants with higher linguistic acculturation scores reported higher mean social disinhibition scores (F = 30.7, df = 2, P < 0.001) compared to their less acculturated counterparts. Participants' mean TAS and DAS scores were 6.9 (SD = 3.3) and 1.2 (SD = 1.6), respectively. Both scores were significantly and positively associated with mean social disinhibition score (P < 0.001 for both).\n\nA total of 672 candidate SNPs were genotyped. Ten SNPs had a Gencall score of less than 95%, 78 additional SNPs failed the minor allele frequency test (MAF <0.05), and 19 SNPs failed the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test (P < 0.000001). A total of 565 SNPs were included in the analyses. There were 60 SNPs with P < 0.05 based on the best genetic model fit (additive, dominant, or recessive), adjusting for age and sex. After controlling for false discovery, we identified 11 SNPs with a statistically significant BFDP of <0.8 and a prior probability of 0.05.\n\nFor the principal components analysis, we used N = 1132 participants and 511 SNPs which were shown to be unassociated with the social disinhibition outcome in univariate analyses at a significance level of 0.05 based on the best genetic model fit (additive, dominant, or recessive model). We did not observe significant ethnic stratification in our data from the principal components analysis. Because only the top three eigenvalues (derived from the top three principal components) were significantly larger than the subsequent eigenvalues, we used these 3 largest principal components in our analyses (Tian et al.,; Nassir et al.,). We also considered controlling for the top 5 and top 10 largest principal components but found no significant difference in the association between SNPs and social disinhibition.\n\nSix of the 11 SNPs were found to be significant at α = 0.05 level in the final multivariable model, which included demographic and psychosocial characteristics as well as the three largest principal components terms. Two of these SNPs are in the serotonin pathway (rs9534511 on HTR2A and rs4938056 on HTR3B), and one is in an intronic region of an opioid receptor gene (rs1998220 on OPRM1). One SNP (rs1003921) resides in an intronic region of KCNC1, one SNP (rs16116) is in an intergenic region downstream of NPY, and one SNP (rs16870286) is part of LINC00518, a miscellaneous RNA gene that codes for an uncharacterized protein. Information about these SNPs, including model used, multivariable P-value, and allelic frequency, is shown in Table 2.\n\nParameter estimates for the final multivariable model are shown in Table 3. Age, linguistic acculturation, TAS, and DAS were all significantly positively associated with increased risk of social disinhibition (P < 0.001). Each 1-year increase in age was estimated to increase social disinhibition score by 0.20 points (95% CI = 0.12–0.29), and each 1-point increase in a participant's overall linguistic acculturation score was expected to increase their social disinhibition score by 0.30 points (95% CI = 0.20–0.41). Similarly, each 1-unit increase in TAS or DAS score is expected to increase participants' social disinhibition score by 0.20 (95% CI = 0.17–0.23) and 0.45 points (95% CI = 0.40–0.51), respectively.

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nFigure 1 depicts the regulatory and coding regions of CNR1 based on the study by Zhang et al and the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Analyses were focused on rs2023239 found in the region upstream of exon 3, which has been described as an alternative promoter. Each approach described in the “Methods” section has a corresponding result subsection.\n\nCB1 BINDING LEVELS IN POSTMORTEM PFC\n\nTo test the association between rs2023239 and CB1 receptor levels, CB1 binding was quantified in postmortem human PFC and the relationship between rs2023239 and CB1 binding was assessed. Ten samples were genotyped as TT and 10 as CT. The ANOVA revealed that individuals with the CT genotype for rs2023239 demonstrated significantly greater CB1 binding in Brodmann areas 9 and 10 compared with individuals with the TT genotype (F1,16 = 9.62, P < .01) (Figure 2).\n\nCUE-ELICITED CRAVING AND BRAIN ACTIVATION\n\nBecause CNR1 receptors modulate the mesocorticolimbic neurocircuitry that underlies drug-seeking behavior in animals, it was expected that the genetic variation that alters CB1 receptor levels would also be associated with the differential activation of these structures during exposure to alcohol cues. To explore the functional significance of rs2023239, data from a recent neuroimaging study were reanalyzed. Participants were 34 heavy drinkers who were right-handed and had no history of psychiatric or neurologic disorders. Two participants had the CC genotype and 8 had the CT genotype. Individuals with at least 1 copy of C (n=10; mean [SD] age, 21.5 [0.71] years; 7 men; all white participants) were age matched with 24 participants who had the TT genotype (mean [SD] age, 22.5 [1.59] years; 17 men; 21 white, 1 Asian, and 2 Latin American participants).\n\nThe CT group demonstrated greater activation when alcohol was contrasted with inactive (ie, rest) and active (ie, litchi juice) appetitive controls in the NAcc, VMPFC, VTA, and OFC compared with the TT group (P < .05) (Figure 3). Pearson product moment correlations between peak activity in these regions and subjective measures indicated several significant findings. In the CT group, the alcohol use disorder score, measured using the AUDIT, was significantly correlated with activation of the NAcc (r = 0.83, P = .003) and the VMPFC (r = 0.68, P = .03) using the alcohol vs active control contrast. In addition, the urge to consume alcohol in the CT group, as measured using the total AUQ score, was also significantly correlated with the VMPFC (r = 0.67, P = .03), the left OFC (r = 0.80, P = .005), and the right OFC (r = 0.62, P = .06). The only correlations that were significant in the TT group were the correlations between the left and right OFC and the AUDIT score (r = 0.42, P < .05 and r = 0.51, P = .01) (Table).\n\nSHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON SUBJECTIVE REWARD\n\nA human laboratory study was conducted to determine whether rs2023239 was associated with the rewarding effects of alcohol. Fifty-six individuals had the TT genotype, 15 had the CT genotype, and 3 had the CC genotype for rs2023239. The individuals with the CC and CT genotypes were combined into 1 group to facilitate analyses. The first set of analyses tested for differences between the TT and CT groups on demographics and alcohol/ other drug use variables. There were no differences in self-reported ancestry. There was 1 individual with African American ancestry in the TT group; the CT group included 1 Latin American, 1 Asian, and 1 African American individual. Of the TT group, 50% smoked tobacco, and of the CT group, 54% smoked tobacco. There were no significant differences (P > .05) between the TT and CT groups in mean (SD) age (21.6 [3] years vs 22.4 [3] years), sex (66% vs 79% male), or mean (SD) past-month quantity of alcohol use measured using a 30-day timeline follow-back method (72 [50] vs 72 [41] standard drinks). Mean breath alcohol levels after each of the 3 drinks were 0.018%, 0.038%, and 0.055% and did not differ by genotype. To ensure that population stratification was not a confounding factor, analyses were repeated with only the white individuals. No differences emerged.\n\nThe primary analyses focused on the reward and positive affect scales of the Profile of Mood States. The analyses involved a 2 (genotype: TT vs CT or CC) × 3 (drink: 1 vs 2 vs 3) repeated-measures ANOVA. The dependent variable was the difference between the alcohol and placebo beverage scores for each drink. Analyses revealed a significant main effect for genotype (F1,69 = 4.27, P <.05) such that individuals with the CT genotype reported significantly greater reward and positive affect after drinking (F1,69 = 6.27, P < .05) (Figure 4A and B).\n\nTo determine whether these results could be replicated with an earlier study, data from a previously published study were reanalyzed.

This previous study allowed us to examine the interaction between a medication that targets the dopamine system (olanzapine) and rs2023239. The analyses involved a 2 (medication: olanzapine vs cyproheptadine hydrochloride) × 2 (genotype: TT vs CT and CC) × 3 (drink: 1 vs 2 vs 3) repeated-measures ANOVA. The analyses revealed a genotype × drink interaction (F2,112 = 5.19, P = .01) such that individuals with the CT genotype reported greater reward from the alcoholic beverages. There were no significant genotype × medication interactions on this measure (P > .05). In lieu of positive affect, we examined self-reported high. The analyses revealed a significant medication × genotype × drink interaction on self-reported high (F2,112 = 3.39, P < .05). Individuals with the CT (or CC) genotype (n = 9) who received the active control medication (cyproheptadine) reported the greatest high after the third drink (Figure 4C). There were no significant differences between individuals with the CT genotype and those with the TT genotype for the olanzapine condition (Figure 4D).\n\nCUE-ELICITED CRAVING AND TREATMENT OUTCOME\n\nGiven the suggestion that there might be an interaction between CNR1 variation and olanzapine on the rewarding effects of alcohol, we reanalyzed data from a recent clinical trial of olanzapine. This study examined the effects of olanzapine (5 mg) on cue-elicited craving and drinks per drinking day during a 12-week trial in a sample of treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals. In the reanalysis, rs2023239 was included as a moderator. There were 23 individuals in the CT group and 46 individuals in the TT group. The analyses revealed a significant medication × genotype × cue interaction on craving (F1,65 = 5.29, P < .05) such that individuals with the CT genotype reported greater cue-elicited craving when treated with placebo vs olanzapine (Figure 5A and B). Individuals with the CT genotype reported greater drinks per drinking day compared with individuals with the TT genotype when treated with placebo vs olanzapine (F1,65 = 3.94, P = .05) (Figure 5C and D).",

    "content": "Results\n\nInhibition of p300 by Garcinol leads to degradation of p300 and influences FOXP3 acetylation\n\nSince both cellular FOXP3 level and transcriptional activity are affected by acetylation and p300 is known to regulate FOXP3 acetylation, we investigated the effects of the p300 inhibitor Garcinol on FOXP3 activity. HEK 293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged FOXP3 (HA-FOXP3a) and Flag-tagged p300 (Flag-p300). Cells were treated with different doses of Garcinol (0–25 µM) for 4 h. Acetylation of FOXP3 and p300 were examined by immunoprecipitation (IP) of acetylated proteins from cell lysate using an anti-acetyl lysine antibody and blotted with anti-HA and anti-Flag antibody for FOXP3 and p300, respectively.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, FOXP3 acetylation was minimal in the absence of p300. Co-expression with p300 enhanced acetylation as well as the protein abundance of FOXP3. Acetylation of both FOXP3 and p300 was reduced by Garcinol in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1A, Ac-K IP).\n\nUnexpectedly, the p300 expression level, as determined by anti-FLAG blot from the total lysate, was also clearly reduced by Garcinol. p300 proteins in the lysate were reduced quantitatively by 15 µM of Garcinol and became undetectable after treatment with 25 µM of Garcinol. No reduction of the FOXP3 protein level was observed at 15 µM of Garcinol. In the presence of 25 µM of Garcinol, when p300 was maximally degraded, the FOXP3 level was reduced and became comparable with that of control transfection (pFLAG, no ectopically expressed p300, no Garcinol treatment). Clearly Garcinol induces p300 degradation and subsequently influences both FOXP3 acetylation levels and stability.\n\nWe studied the interaction between p300 and FOXP3 by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). Lysates from cells with co-expression of p300 and FOXP3 were first precipitated with the anti-Flag antibody for p300 and probed with the anti-HA antibody for FOXP3. As shown in Fig. 1B, Garcinol limited the interaction between p300 and FOXP3. At 15 µM Garcinol, the amount of precipitated p300 was comparable with that in the control (no Garcinol treatment), but less FOXP3 proteins were associated with p300. At 25 µM Garcinol, there were still some p300 proteins in the co-IP but FOXP3 became indiscernible. Garcinol promotes the disassembly of the FOXP3-p300 complex while driving p300 into degradation.\n\nGarcinol-mediated degradation of p300 is prevented by Chloroquine\n\nFOXP3 degradation is thought to be mediated primarily through proteasomal pathways. To determine whether Garcinol-induced p300 degradation is promoted by proteasomal processes or by other mechanisms, we examined several inhibitors of protein degradation, including MG132, Chloroquine, E-64, pepstatin A, and PMSF (Fig. S1). Chloroquine, but not MG132 or any other inhibitors, efficiently blocked Garcinol-mediated p300 degradation. As shown in Fig. 2A, Chloroquine dose-dependently reversed the effect of Garcinol on both p300 and FOXP3 in terms of both protein and acetylation levels.\n\nFOXP3 acetylation was clearly observed when 5 µM or more Chloroquine was present as compared with cells treated with 25 µM Garcinol alone. Complete blocking of p300 degradation was observed with 20 µM Chloroquine. Interestingly, although Garcinol was able to prevent p300 from acetylating substrates, it did not affect auto-acetylation of p300. As shown in Fig. 2A, acetylation of Garcinol treated-p300 was detectable once p300 degradation was blocked by Chloroquine.\n\nThe effect of MG132 on FOXP3 degradation was complex. At 5 µM, a level that is routinely used to block proteasome-mediated protein degradation, MG132 was not able to counteract Garcinol on FOXP3 acetylation and stability (Fig. 2A). At higher concentrations (>20 µM), MG132 promoted FOXP3 degradation, as well as the degradation of the control protein β-actin, indicating a broad, non-specific outcome that may be related to the presence of both Garcinol and MG132. Interestingly, acetylation of FOXP3 was increased at higher MG132 concentrations, despite the reduced FOXP3 protein levels. Acetylated forms of FOXP3 appeared to be more stable.\n\nClearly, these studies indicate that Garcinol promotes the entry of p300 into a lysosome-mediated protein degradation pathway, indirectly leading to reduced acetylation of FOXP3. The influence of Garcinol on the FOXP3 protein level is limited as compared with that on p300. Although massive destruction of FOXP3 was not observed in the presence of Garcinol, the reduction of FOXP3 protein levels accompanying the loss of p300 also appeared to be lysosomally related.\n\nTo further confirm the role of Chloroquine in the degradation of p300, we utilized bafilomycin A1. Bafilomycin A1 inhibits the initial localization of Chloroquine to acidic vesicles, thus blocking Chloroquine from disrupting lysosomal function. Bafilomy",

Bafilomycin A1 inhibits the initial localization of Chloroquine to acidic vesicles, thus blocking Chloroquine from disrupting lysosomal function. Bafilomycin A1 alone slightly promoted p300 degradation (Fig. 2B, lane 2 vs lane 7). While Chloroquine prevented Garcinol-induced p300 degradation (lane 2B vs lane 2), bafilomycin A1 attenuated the effect of Chloroquine (Fig. 2B, lane 5), leading to reduced acetylated p300 signals noted after anti-acetyl lysine immunoprecipitation as well as reduced total p300 protein levels in the lysate (Fig. 2B).\n\nDegradation of FOXP3 after Garcinol treatment is not dependent on acetylation of FOXP3 by ectopic p300\n\nWe next examined if the Garcinol effect was only dependent on ectopic expression of p300. For this purpose, HEK 293T cells were transfected with HA-FOXP3a only. As shown in Fig. 3A, Garcinol was able to reduce FOXP3 acetylation in a dose dependent manner, and Chloroquine reversed the Garcinol effect on FOXP3 (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with our observation that FOXP3 can be acetylated by endogenous acetyltransferases but to a lesser extent than with ectopically over-expressed p300.\n\nPreviously we have identified K250/K252 in human FOXP3 as an important acetylation site for p300. Mutations on these two sites greatly reduce FOXP3 acetylation by p300. We investigated the effect of Garcinol on the FOXP3 K250R/K252R mutant. As shown in Fig. 3B, although the acetylation level of this mutant was reduced as compared with the wild type FOXP3 (Fig. 3A), Garcinol was still able to reduce acetylation of this mutant, and degradation of FOXP3 by Garcinol was prevented by the addition of Chloroquine. For both the wild type FOXP3 (Fig. 3A) and the K250R/K252R mutant (Fig. 3B), MG132 at 5 µM further increased Garcinol-induced FOXP3 degradation.\n\nAcetylation of the FOXP3 K250R/K252R mutant indicates that there exist additional acetylation sites for p300. It is also possible that other endogenous acetyltransferases are involved in the acetylation of FOXP3, and Garcinol can also inhibit these acetyltransferases. We have observed synergistic effects of p300 and TIP60 on FOXP3 (Xiao et al., in preparation).\n\nGarcinol as a broad spectrum acetyltransferase inhibitor\n\nGarcinol was reported to inhibit p300 and P/CAF (also known as KAT2B) with comparable activity (IC50: 7 and 5 µM, respectively). Garcinol was also observed to inhibit TIP60 at comparable levels to anarcadic acid (IC50: Garcinol = 12 µM, anarcadic acid = 6 µM) (Arun Dutta, personal communication). We compared the inhibitory activity of Garcinol on several acetyltransferases in our cell-based system and examined the acetylation level by immunoprecipitation with the anti-acetyl lysine antibody.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 4, Garcinol inhibited all enzymes (p300, CBP (also known as CREBBP), TIP60 and P/CAF) to some extent. Among these enzymes, p300 was the most sensitive to Garcinol inhibition. At 15 µM, Garcinol clearly inhibited both protein level and acetylation level of p300. TIP60 was also sensitive to Garcinol, but only the acetylation level was reduced by 15 µM Garcinol. At 25 µM, Garcinol reduced only P/CAF acetylation and barely affected the protein level. CBP was the most resistant to Garcinol, with both acetylation and protein levels still readily detectable in 25 µM Garcinol.\n\nWe had shown earlier that 25 µM Garcinol completely abolished FOXP3 acetylation levels (Fig. 1). At this concentration, Garcinol affected both p300 and TIP60, but not CBP and P/CAF levels. Taken together, this study indicates that both p300 and TIP60 may be more relevant to regulation of FOXP3 than P/CAF and CBP.\n\nMutations on FOXP3 that increase acetylation and stability render FOXP3 more susceptible to Garcinol-induced degradation\n\nWe have identified four Lys residues that affect acetylation of FOXP3: K31, K179, K227, and K268. When any of these Lys residues was substituted with the same positively charged Arg residue, acetylation of FOXP3 as well as the total protein levels were increased (Fig. 3C). Although protein levels of these mutants were not significantly affected by Garcinol, acetylation of these FOXP3 mutants was much more susceptible to inhibition by Garcinol (15 µM) than that of the wild type FOXP3 (Fig. 3D). Treatment of Garcinol induced more significant reduction in acetylation levels in these FOXP3 mutants",

Treatment of Garcinol induced more significant reduction in acetylation levels in these FOXP3 mutants, especially the K31R mutant. Our study concluded that these 4 Lys play a negative role in the overall acetylation levels of FOXP3. The mutants might be much more accessible to acetyltransferases and thus had much higher acetylation levels. However, the elevated acetylation levels were sustained by endogenous acetyltransferases such as p300 and TIP60. When these enzymes were inhibited and degraded by Garcinol, the acetylation level of FOXP3 was then quickly reduced.\n\nInhibition of Treg functions by Garcinol\n\nWe next examined whether Garcinol affected Treg suppressive function. Mouse CD4+CD25high Treg cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and used to study their activity to suppress the proliferation of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)—labeled primary CD4+CD25−CD45RBhigh T cells (representing effector T cells, Teff) (Fig. 5). Teff and Treg cells were mixed at different ratios. The proliferative population of Teff were compared between all treatments. Treg cells inhibited the proliferation of Teff cells in a dose-dependent manner.\n\nModest intrinsic inhibitory activity of Garcinol on Teff was noted even in the absence of Treg cells. Effector cells were slightly less proliferative when incubated with Garcinol (data not shown). The population of proliferative Teff cell was reduced from 54% in the control to 48.3% and 38.4% in the presence of 2 µM and 4 µM Garcinol, respectively. Nevertheless, after the population of dividing Teff under different conditions was normalized to that of Teff cells treated only by Garcinol (Fig. 5), it was obvious that Garcinol treatment reduced the suppressive activity of Treg cells and led to more proliferative Teff cells. The Garcinol effect was more obvious when there were less Treg cells in the mixture, e.g. at the Teff/Treg ratio of 16:1 and 8:1.\n\nSynergistic activity of Garcinol and anti-p185her2/neu in the treatment of tumors in vivo\n\np185her2/neu is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases and has been validated as a clinical target for breast and stomach cancers. Monoclonal antibodies to the oncoprotein of rat origin were developed to establish the foundation for targeted therapies to solid tumors. One of the monoclonal antibodies, mAb7.16.4, has a shared epitope with trastuzumab, a FDA approved therapeutic agent in clinical use. 7.16.4 is active on Erbb2/neu transformed rodent and human tumors in a variety of assays. 7.16.4 has been used in many labs around the world in transgenic animal models of tumors induced by the neu oncogene.\n\nRecent studies defined a role for CD8+ IFN-γ-secreting cells and NK ADCC mediating cells as contributory elements in 7.16.4 therapy of implanted tumor model of neu transformed cells. It is expected that both active innate and adaptive immune cells that translocate and reside in the tumors contribute to the anti-cancer activity of 7.16.4 and trastuzumab. In addition we have noted the presence of infiltrated FOXP3+ T cells in tumor tissues (unpublished) and others have noted that FOXP3+ T cells may affect the growth of transplanted neu transformed cells in rodent model of tumor evasion.\n\nWe examined whether Garcinol, which promotes degradation of p300 and contributes to FOXP3 loss, could enhance 7.16.4 anti-tumor activity. The target tumor cell line H2N113 was established from the tumor of MMTV-neu transgenic mice. In vitro proliferation assay demonstrated that 7.16.4 could inhibit H2N113 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). We did note that Garcinol slightly inhibited the proliferation of H2N113. However, Garcinol was not able to enhance the activity of 7.16.4 in this in vitro assay.\n\nIn vivo activity of Garcinol was studied in a transplant model. We implanted H2N113 tumor cells into BALB/c-MMTV-neu/FOXP3-GFP mice as reported previously. Treatment began when tumors were apparent (10 days after tumor inoculation). Mice were treated with 7.16.4, at either low dose (1.8 mg/kg) or high dose (9 mg/kg), twice weekly. As shown in Fig. 6B, the high dose 7.16.4 treatment alone significantly reduced the tumor growth.\n\nThe growth of tumor appeared to be only modestly reduced by the low dose 7.16.4 treatment. While Garcinol (43.6 mg/kg) had little discernible effects on the growth of tumors, the combination of Garcinol and low dose 7.16.4 led to enhanced inhibition of tumor growth. These data indicate that the inhibitory activity of Garcinol on Treg function has a positive effect on anti-p185her2/neu antibody targeted therapy",

    "content": "Findings\n\nExogenous lipid metabolism involves packaging of dietary fat into chylomicrons in the small intestine, which are later transported to the bloodstream. The initial step of endogenous lipid metabolism involves the hydrolysis of chylomicrons by lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 1,000,000 in the United States and higher in other world regions, like Quebec, Canada due to a founder effect. The clinical presentation can include moderate or severe hypertriglyceridemia in affected homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, while simple heterozygote carriers often have normal lipids. Clinical features include eruptive xanthomas, abdominal pain, hepato-splenomegaly, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, recurrent pancreatitis, or lipemia retinalis. Dietary fat restriction is the cornerstone of treatment, and gene therapy trials are ongoing.\n\nCase report\n\nWe report the case of an 11-week-old male of Puerto Rican descent who presented to the emergency department with coffee-ground emesis, melena and a papular rash. He was born full term to healthy, nonconsanguineous parents with a birth weight of 8 lb 4 oz and was exclusively breast-fed. He had 4–5 episodes of coffee-ground emesis, one episode of melena and a papular rash (Fig. 1) that spread from his extremities to his trunk over the course of 3 weeks. CBC revealed a hematocrit of 17 % and his blood was grossly lipemic. A random lipid panel showed triglycerides (TG) of 43,980 mg/dl.\n\nThe physical exam was notable for a well-appearing infant with diffuse 2 mm yellow papules consistent with eruptive xanthomas and lipemia retinalis on fundoscopic exam. Fasting lipid profile revealed total cholesterol 768 mg/dl, TG 37,695 mg/dl, and HDL < 10 mg/dl. Breast-feeding was discontinued and he was placed on Enfaport Lipil, a formula with 84 % of fat content from medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and 16 % from long-chain fats. A repeat lipid profile one month after the formula change revealed dramatic improvement in TG (Table 1). Two months after treatment, xanthomas and lipemia retinalis resolved; weight gain and linear growth were normal. We hypothesized that this child had an autosomal recessive mutation in the LPL gene.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics, consent and permission:Approval was obtained from the Western University Ethics Review Board protocol 07920E and informed consent was obtained from both parents. The parents gave their consent to publish this case.\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, QIAGEN Inc, Mississauga, ON, Canada). PCR amplifications were performed using primers covering the coding regions and ~100 bp of intron-exon boundaries of the LPL gene as described previously. Bi-directional Sanger sequencing was performed using established conditions on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). DNA sequences were analyzed using SeqScape v2.6 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).\n\nResults and discussion\n\nWe found that the proband was a compound heterozygote for one novel and one reported mutation within exon 5 of the LPL gene (Fig. 2). The first mutation p.G215E was a heterozygous transition c.644G → A, resulting in a substitution of glycine to glutamic acid at amino acid 215 (identical to residue 188 in the mature protein). This mutation has been previously reported to cause LPL deficiency. The second, novel mutation p.Q240H was a heterozygous transversion c.721G → T, causing an amino acid substitution of glutamine to histidine at residue 240 (identical to residue 213 in the mature protein). In silico software programs PolyPhen2 and SIFT both predicted that this mutation was probably damaging. Both parents' DNA samples were sequenced: the LPL p.Q240H mutation was found in the father and the p.G215E mutation was found in the mother.\n\nLPL plays a role in multiple stages of lipid metabolism, including hydrolysis of chylomicrons. LPL is primarily synthesized by myocytes and adipocytes and recent studies have identified glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) as the molecule responsible for transporting LPL to the capillary lumen. LPL deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by decreased LPL activity due to mutations in the LPL gene. The LPL gene is located on chromosome 8p21.3 and contains 10 exons, spanning ~ 30 kb and encodes a mature protein of 448 amino acids. Most mutations are found in exons 4, 5 and 6 and although missense mutations are more common, nonsense, frameshift, insertion, deletion and duplication mutations have also been described. The mutation in this patient expands the spectrum of known pathogenic LPL mutations to more than 150. It also occurs in a region of the protein that has to date been relatively bereft of reported mutations. The involvement of amino acid residue 240 also highlights the functional importance of the local domain in lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.\n\nTo date, genotype-phenotype correlations have not been identified. Patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygotes can present with marked hypertriglyceridemia. Heterozygote patients can have normal or",

Patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygotes can present with marked hypertriglyceridemia. Heterozygote patients can have normal or mildly elevated TG levels. Both parents of our patient are heterozygous carriers of LPL gene mutations and had normal lipids.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of LPL deficiency are heterogeneous. Eruptive xanthomas appear mostly on shoulders, buttocks and extensor surfaces of the limbs when the TG levels exceed 2000 mg/dl. Lipemia retinalis involving the peripheral vessels can be seen with TG levels over 2,500 mg/dl and as the levels increase, the damage extends to the posterior pole. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal hemorrhage have been attributed to hyperviscosity secondary to elevated TG. Pancreatitis is common in these patients and risk increases with TG levels over 1,000 mg/dl. Therefore, the goal of therapy is to decrease TG levels < 1,000 mg/dl.\n\nDietary restriction remains the cornerstone of treatment and fat supplements using MCT are useful since they are absorbed directly into the portal vein. Long-term data on patients with LPL deficiency are limited but show normal linear growth and puberty despite dietary fat restriction. Even with recurrent pancreatitis, this population does not demonstrate a high mortality rate. Satisfactory TG levels can be difficult to achieve with diet restriction alone. Drug therapy using gemfibrozil, omega-3 fatty acids and orlistat may decrease TG levels when combined with a fat-restricted diet however, the use of these drugs is controversial. Therapy involving intramuscular introduction of a gain-of-function variant of the LPL gene is approved in Europe, although is costly and has only a transient effect. A promising treatment approach currently under investigation is orally-administered diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) inhibitors targeting DGAT1, which mediates triglyceride synthesis during dietary fat absorption.\n\nOur patient is a compound heterozygote who has a novel p.Q240H mutation in exon 5 of the LPL gene causing severe hypertriglyceridemia. Although his TG levels are much improved with MCT-based formula, the challenge will be maintaining those levels with dietary fat restriction as table foods are introduced and he grows through childhood.\n\nCompeting interests\n\nAngela Ganan Soto, Adam McIntyre, Sungeeta Agrawal, Shara R.

No association between glutamate levels and diagnosis (p = 0.68), or depression symptom severity (p = 0.75) was found. There was no association between glutamate levels and any other SNP. There was also no association between any SNPs, including rs3812778/rs3829280, when combined glutamate/glutamine levels were analyzed using the TE80 method. No association was found in the LDLPFC (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nrs3812778/rs3829280 are associated with CD44 levels\n\nIn silico analyses, using the BrainCloud eQTL-browser, we found an association between the minor allele of rs3829280 and higher levels of the SLC1A2 neighboring gene CD44 mRNA (chr11:35240935-35243200(*)) (Fig. 2a, p = 0.00010). These findings were strengthened with data from the UK Brain Expression Consortium, where significant associations were identified between the minor allele of rs3812778/rs3829280 and higher levels of the full-length transcript of CD44 in the cerebellar cortex, putamen, and substantia nigra, as well as in the average of all measured brain regions (Fig. 2b). Significant associations were also found for other CD44 transcripts (Supplementary Table 2). When searching for potential surrounding functional SNPs, we found six SNPs in perfect LD (R2 = 1) with rs3812778/rs3829280: rs10836358, rs67384276, rs56193087, rs1570216, rs4508184, rs12360706. Analysis with GWAVA, a tool for functional annotation of noncoding sequence, revealed high values across all prediction scores (> 0.6) for rs1570216, indicating high probability for functionality for this SNP lying in the 3′-UTR of SLC1A2 in a genomic area sensitive for DNaseI also rich in H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 monomethylation (Supplementary Table 3).\n\nCD44 strongly correlates with astrocytic markers\n\nGiven the important role CD44 plays in brain development, the correlation between CD44 expression and the expression of genes of the glutamate–glutamine cycle were assessed across several brain regions pre- and postnatally using data from the BrainSpan project (Fig. 3a). Strong positive correlations between CD44 and genes typically expressed in astrocytes (GLUL, SLC1A3, SLC1A2, and SLC38A3) were seen both pre- and postnatally, while no or negative correlations were observed for genes typically expressed in neurons (GLS, SLC1A1, SLC1A6, SLC38A1, SLC17A7, SLC17A6, SLC17A8, and SLC1A7). Furthermore, CD44 also very strongly correlated with typical astrocytic markers like AQP4, S100b, and GFAP (Fig. 3b).\n\nrs3812778/rs3829280 and rapid cycling (RC) prevalence\n\nWe then performed an exploratory investigation to check for disease relevance. Similar to the genetic spectroscopic study, the follow-up cohort was composed of both MDD and BD individuals of Swedish and Caucasian American origin. Demographic characteristics can be found in Table 1. rs3812778/rs3829280 were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of both SNPs in the whole cohort were 13%, corresponding to those in European populations.\n\nThere was no significant difference in the percentage of minor allele carriers of rs3812778/rs3829280 in BD vs MDD participants (odds ratio (OR): 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84–1.32], p = 0.647). While the percentage of minor allele carriers was comparable between MDD (21.9% [95% CI: 19.1–24.9]) and non-RC (NRC) BD (21.8% [95% CI: 17.9–25.8]), RC BD participants had a significantly higher percentage of minor allele carriers in comparison with the MDD+NRC BD group (26.9% [95% CI: 23.5–30.5]) (age- and sex-adjusted OR: 1.38 [95% CI: 1.09–1.73], p = 0.006, pcor = 0.012; unadjusted OR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.05–1.64], p = 0.015, pcor",

The total number of individuals was 84,694 (22,040 cases and 62,654 controls), and the total number of meta-analyzed SNPs was 5,356,204. No inflation of test statistics in the quantile-quantile plot (λgc = 1.042 and λ1,000 = 1.001) was observed (Figure S1). SNP-based meta-analysis (Figure 1A) replicated the previously identified loci C9orf72, UNC13A, and GPX3-TNIP1. C21orf2, TBK1, and KIF5A SNPs previously reported to be associated with ALS risk were present only in the European dataset. We identified an additional association in the ACSL5-ZDHHC6 locus (five significant SNPs in linkage disequilibrium [LD], lead SNP rs58854276 p = 8.3 × 10−9, A allele frequency 64.9%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05–1.11; Table 1; Figure S2A) and two putative loci, G2E3-SCFD1 (lead SNP rs229247 p = 2.2 × 10−7, T allele frequency 47.9%, OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.04–1.10; Table 1; Figure S2B) and TRIP11-ATXN3 (lead SNP rs10143310 p = 2.6 × 10−7, C allele frequency 24.5%, OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.05–1.12; Table 1; Figure S2C). Using an independent Australian cohort (837 cases and 665 controls of European ancestry; STAR Methods; Table S1), we replicated the association between the ACSL5 lead SNP, rs58854276, and ALS (A allele frequency 66.1%, OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.01–1.38, p = 0.037). rs58854276 was not the lead ACSL5 SNP in either of the meta-analyzed studies. It was the second most significant ACSL5 SNP in the Chinese study and the fourth most significant ACSL5 SNP in the European study (p = 0.00015 and p = 1.1 × 10−6 respectively; Tables 1 and S2), highlighting the differences in terms of LD structure and frequencies in the two populations. ACSL5 and ZDHHC6 (gene-p = 8.1 × 10−8 and 2.7 × 10−6, respectively) and one gene in each of the two putative loci, ATXN3 (gene-p = 2.6 × 10−7) and G2E3 (gene-p = 1.2 × 10−7), were genome-wide significant in the gene-based analysis (Figure 1B; STAR Methods), consistent with the information contributed by the SNP associations, and recognizing that neighboring genes have overlapping boundaries in the gene-based analyses so that the same SNPs can contribute to more than one gene test. Another gene, B4GALNT1, was genome-wide significant in the gene-based analysis (gene-p = 1.8 × 10−6); however, no SNPs individually reached the putative threshold (lead SNP rs12320537, C allele frequency 20.5%, p = 6.2 × 10−6). Finally, using the summary statistics data of our previously published gene-burden analysis of disruptive, damaging, and missense variants on 4,389 ALS patients and 1,846 controls, for the seven genes in the four identified loci, i.e., ACSL5, ZDHHC6, B4GALNT1, SCFD1, G2E3, TRIP11, and ATXN3, we observed an association between rare variants in G2E3 and ALS (p = 0.0019, OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.27–4.23; Table 1).\n\nFine-Mapping of the Identified Loci\n\nWe attempted to fine-map the four identified loci by assessing whether their independent lead SNPs or LD proxies have cis expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) effects observed in brain and blood tissues in the GTEx data (Table 2; STAR Methods). Only one lead SNP per locus was selected as no other significant SNP in the loci met our independence criterion (r2 < 0.80). All four lead SNPs were in LD with cis-eQTLs for several brain tissues (Table 2). rs12320537 (B4GALNT1 lead SNP) was in LD with rs2258877 (r2 = 0.88), a brain cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere cis-eQTL of B4GALNT1 (p = 1.8 × 10−5 and 1.7 × 10−7, respectively). rs58854276 (ACSL5-ZDHHC6 lead SNP) was in LD with rs2419629 (r2 = 0.90), a brain cerebellum and brain nucleus accumbens basal ganglia cis-eQTL of ZDHHC",

The four lead SNPs were also in strong LD with blood cis-eQTLs. The complete results from this analysis are available in Table 2.\n\nInvestigation of the Effect of ACSL5 and GPX3 SNPs on Patients’ Body Weight and Composition\n\nACSL5 SNPs and their overexpression have been associated with rapid weight loss in humans. Interestingly, another ALS gene, GPX3, was recently found to be associated with weight loss. To investigate the effect of the ALS-associated SNPs in ACSL5 and GPX3 on patients’ weight measures, we set out to test whether the SNPs (ACSL5 lead SNP rs58854276 and GPX3 lead SNP rs3828599) were associated with decline and difference in weight traits within the context of ALS (Table 3). We used a dataset from the metabolic exploration in neurodegenerative disease-motor neuron disease (MEND-MND) initiative that included 77 cases and 77 controls (STAR Methods; Table S4) for whom fat mass, fat-free mass, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) were available (complete results in Table S3). This dataset included longitudinal records for 67 of the 77 cases. In a linear regression analysis fitting sex as a covariate and using baseline measures, cases had significantly lower fat-free mass than controls (−4.2 ± 1.2 kg, p = 1.9 × 10−4); although cases had lower values for the other traits, they were not significantly different (pBMI = 0.58, pweight = 0.32, and pfat-mass = 0.22). For cases, using a repeated-measures linear mixed model, fat-free mass had the greatest decline over time (−2.2 kg/year, p = 2.6 × 10−18). Decline in weight (−2.2 kg/year, p = 1.2 × 10−9) and BMI (−0.73 year, p = 1.8 × 10−9) were also significant, but change in fat mass was not (0.091/year, p = 0.37). Therefore, we focused on fat-free mass for the genetic analyses. Using a linear regression model, for ACSL5 the A allele of rs58854276 was suggestively associated with lower fat-free mass at first visit in cases (−2.0 ± 1.3 kg/A allele, p = 0.14), but not in controls (−0.1 ± 1.0 kg/A allele, p = 0.89). For GPX3, the A allele of rs3828599 was not associated with lower fat-free mass at baseline visit in either cases (−1.0 ± 1.3 kg/A allele, p = 0.47) or controls (0.2 ± 1.2 kg/A allele, p = 0.89), although its effect was in the expected direction in cases. In the cases for whom longitudinal data were available, with a linear mixed model using the repeated-measures across individuals and fitting individuals as a random effect and time since first visit as a covariate, the association trend between the rs58854276 A allele and a lower fat-free mass showed a trend toward significance (−2.1 ± 1.3 kg/A allele",

A similar trend was observed for the rs3828599 A allele (−1.0 ± 1.3 kg/A allele, p = 0.22). Using a linear regression model, the mean change of fat-free mass between first and last visit was not associated with either rs58854276 or rs3828599 (p = 0.74 and 0.49, respectively). Recognizing that the MEND-MND sample lacks power (STAR Methods), we used the Sporadic ALS Australia (SALSA) cohort (217 cases; STAR Methods, related to the Experimental Model and Subject Details), which provided a larger sample size for BMI and weight at first visit, but not fat-free mass measurements. In this case cohort, we observed no association between the SNPs and weight (rs58854276 p = 0.97 and rs3828599 p = 0.50) or BMI (rs58854276 p = 0.47 and rs3828599 p = 0.33) at first visit. It is important to recognize that BMI and weight do not always accurately reflect changes in fat-free mass in ALS and that in the case cohorts, individuals have weight measurements taken at cross-sectional times relative to their personal disease trajectory. Here, including time since diagnosis in the analysis did not offer further clarity.",

The average age for SCA diagnosis was 35.8 months and this range was highly variable (3 to 144 months). Although 70.3% of patients experienced symptoms before completing one year, only half of these symptomatic children (52.6%) were medically diagnosed in the first year. The mean age for first symptoms manifestation was 14.3 months, where dactylitis was the most common symptom (69.3%), followed by pain episodes (22.4%) and severe anemia (7.8%). The number of hospitalizations varied between 0 to 22 events (mean of 2.9 events) and 16.7% of the sampled population was never hospitalized. 28.6% of the children had never received a transfusion and the mean was 2.4 transfusions. The percentual values of HbF ranged between 0.7 and 23.8% (mean of 5.65 ± 3.98 %) and total hemoglobin levels ranged from 4.25 to 10.00 g/dL (mean of 7.33 ± 0.97 g/dL). Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the clinical characteristics of the patients according to their genotype.\n\n3.2. Genetic Findings\n\nThe distribution analysis of haplotype frequencies (Figure 2A), showed that the most prevalent was the homozygous CAR/CAR, detected in 92.15% (n = 176), followed by the CAR/BEN in 5.76% (n = 11). The other haplotypes observed were very rare: 1.05% CAR/SEN (n = 2), 1.05% CAR/CAM (n = 2). The statistical analysis showed significant differences between groups for the HbF values (Table 1). In the sampled population, the CAR/CAM individuals had the higher values of erythrocytes, HbF (Figure 2B) and hemoglobin, whereas the CAR/CAR had the lowest. As for the gamma ratio parameter, the CAR/CAR had the lowest values and the CAR/SEN the highest.\n\nAdditionally, we explore the frequency of some relevant polymorphisms already described in the literature: rs4671393, rs11886868, rs1427407, rs7557939 in BCL11A gene, rs66650371 in HBS1L-MYB intergenic region, rs7482144 in Xmn1-HBG2 and rs7924684 in BGLT3 gene (Table 2). The HbF values were statistically significant for almost all of the variants studied, except for rs7924684 (p = 0.053). Five of the SNPs had a significant association with the ratio of gamma chains. The genotypes of the polymorphisms in BCL11A gene were statistically associated with fetal hemoglobin (Figure 3). And three of them were significantly associated with neutrophil count and gamma chain ratio.\n\nAll of the studied polymorphisms were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05). We defined a linkage disequilibrium region in chromosome 2, including the BCL11A SNPs. The Arlequin software defined ten different combinations of haplotypes in our cohort, but given the low frequency of some, we only included in this paper the most prevalent ones. These genotypes are compared with HbF values in Figure 4.",

    "content": "Results\n\nTen percent of patients from the Center were lost to follow up (Fig. 2). One hundred and eighty five children were enrolled in this study, 72% with SCA, 16% with Hb/Sβ0-thalassemia and 12% with Hb/Sβ+ thalassemia. The mean age was 9.5 years, with ranges from 19 months to 18 years. 15.3% of the children met the definition criteria of cerebral vasculopathy. There were missing data for 22 of included patients. \n\nSickle cell genotypes\n\nIn our study, homozygous sickle cell patients had significantly lower mean hemoglobin and hematocrit levels than Sβ0 and then Sβ + patients. On the clinical level, SCA was significantly associated with ACS, bacterial infections, cholelithiasis, hospitalizations and more frequent transfusions (Table 1). \n\nSickle cell haplotypes\n\nHaving at least one Bantu allele concerned almost all of our study population. The patients with Bantu / Bantu haplotype had significantly lower hematocrit, higher MCV and MCHC. They were hospitalized andtransfusedmore often (Table 2). \n\nAlpha thalessemia\n\nFifty percent of the patients had a alpha-3.7 mutation of at least one alpha gene. The absence of this alpha-thalassemic mutation was significantly associated with cerebral vasculopathy and more frequent RBC transfusions (Table 3). \n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphism\n\nTable 4 shows the different SNP associated with the hemolytic subphenotype. The table of patient characteristics according to the SNP, being very complex given the large number of variables, we found it simpler here to describe the data. The presence of Xmn1 in our cohort was significantly associated with higher hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, decreased leukocytes, and a higher splenic ratio. Having two favourable SNP alleles rs4671393 was significantly associated with higher hemoglobin and hematocrit, and a higher HbF for patients under HU treatment, as well as lower HbS. Patients with at least one favourable rs11886868 allele had higher hemoglobin and hematocrit. Patients with at least one favorable rs1427407or rs9399137 alleles had higher HbFlevel. The favourable rs10189857 allele was associated with a low hemoglobin and hematocrit and high leucocytes. Patients with the favourable rs28384513 allele were more frequently diagnosed with the neonatal screening test. The absence of TAC deletion at SNP rs66650371 was significantly associated with higher mortality. \n\nUGT1A1 gene mutations status\n\nThe low number of patients with the UGTA1 mutation (n = 23, 12%) did not allow statistical analysis.\n\nHemoglobin F (Table 5)\n\nThe survival analysis without occurrence of cerebral vasculopathy showed that the group of patients with HbF > 10% presented a significantly greater risk of early onset of cerebral vasculopathy, the main complication of the hemolytic sub-phenotype (Fig. 3). The group with low HbF was associated with vaso-occlusive complications. Homozygous Bantu patients in the HbF group> 10% were was associated with an increase in hemoglobin level in less hospitalized (p = 0.002), less transfused (p = 0.025), had less VOC / year (p = 0.039), but they had more cerebral vasculopathy (p = 0.023) than those with < 10% HbF. Homozygous Bantu patients in the HbF group < 10% had less cholelithiasis (p = 0.021). Patients in both groups, when they carried one or two Benin haplotypes, were less hospitalized (p = 0.002), had less VOC per year (p = 0.039) and their 1st VOC occurred less early (p = 0.03) than those that did not have any Benin haplotypes. Only the patients heterozygous for Benin haplotypes had a significant high HbF level (p = 0.04). Patients who do not carry a Benin allele were more transfused (p = 0.018) than those who did. The alpha-thalassemic mutation was associated with an increase in hemoglobin level in patients at risk of vasculopathy (p = 0.023), and an increased leukocyte rate (p = 0.001). Children in the group with an alpha mutation were hospitalized less often (p = 0.004) and were less likely to have cholelithiasis (p = 0.041) than other children. Children in the < 10% HbF group who carried an alpha mutation received fewer transfusions than those > 10% (p = 0.048). Multivariate analysis (Table 5) did not find any independent genotypic marker. However, some SNPs were close to significance: BCL11A rs1427407 (p = 0.051) and BCL11A rs11886868 (p = 0.06). BCL11A rs4671393 (p = 0.2) and HMIP rs9399137 (p = 0.24) were not independently associated with the phenotypic groups. A concordance chi-2 test found preferential associations between some SNPs (Table 6). The linkage imbalance between BCL11A rs66650371 and rs9399137 was highly significant",

Among the 610 patients 50.3% were female; the mean age (± SD) of patients was 17.3±10 years (range: 5–54 years), and the majority of patients were children aged 5–10 years (32.2%; n = 196) or adolescents 11–20 years (50%; n = 305). Patients lived mostly in the urban areas of Yaoundé and Douala (93%; n = 567), the two largest cities in Cameroon. Among the participants, 41% (n = 238), 45.6% (n = 265) and 13.2% (n = 78) attended formal primary, secondary or tertiary education levels, respectively.\n\nMarital status of parents was distributed as follows: married (58%; n = 235), single (28%; n = 113), widows (9%, n = 36) and divorced (5%; n = 21). Forty two percent (n = 158) of fathers and 23% (n = 108) of mothers were formally employed, while 41% (n = 153) of fathers and 39% (n = 183) of mothers were working in the informal sector. The majority of parents (75%) earned monthly direct incomes that were < 300 USD. The median age at diagnosis of SCA, based on haemoglobin electrophoresis, was 3 years (range: 1month - 29 years). Only 31% (n = 180) of patients were diagnosed before their first year of life.\n\nAfter molecular analysis, the vast majority of patients were determined to have SCA (HbSS) (ie, 97.4%; n = 594); 15 (2.4%) patients were HbS-β thalassemia and one patient had an HbSC genotype.\n\nThere were no significant differences among the socio-demographic variables (marital status of parents, employment status, <300 USD direct revenue; urban vs. rural), in association with HbF levels or in association with the clinical events (number of VOC, number of hospital attendance or number of hospitalisations, overt strokes). The hematological parameters were generally comparable to those of African Americans in the CSSCD; the WBC count and the occurrence of VOC were somewhat more frequent in the Cameroonians (Table 1).\n\nHaplotypes in the beta-globin gene cluster\n\nBased on analysis of 1082 chromosomes, the allele frequencies of various haplotypes in the beta-globin genes cluster showed that Benin (74%; n = 799) and Cameroon (19%; n = 207) were most prevalent forms, followed by atypical haplotype (6%; n = 66). Bantu (n = 5); Senegal (n = 3) and Indian-Arab (n = 2) alleles were very rare.\n\nIn combination, the Benin/Benin haplotypes represented 57% (n = 307), Benin/Cameroon 25% (n = 137), Benin/atypical 8% (n = 45) and Cameroon/Cameroon 5% (n = 26) haplotypes were most prevalent. There were no significant differences in the association with clinical events or HbF levels among the haplotype combinations.\n\nAssociation of Genetic Variants to HbF Levels\n\nWe did not replicate the association of rs7482144 in HBG2 to the HbF levels. The adjacent rs5006884 OR51B5/6, was also not significantly associated to HbF level in Cameroonian SCA patients (Table 2). On the other hand, the two principal known HbF loci were significantly associated in the study patients (Table 2). The effect of minor alleles at this these loci resulted either in a depression of mean HbF values (rs28384513, HBS1L-MYB), or an increase in HbF (rs4671393 in BCL11A; rs9399137 and rs9494142 in HBS1L-MYB) (figure 1). As previously reported in African Americans at the BCL11A loci, when we conditioned the association analysis on rs4671393, rs11886868 was no longer significant, suggesting that these markers tag the same causal polymorphism n this Cameroonian SCA cohort.\n\nThe largest allelic effect (0.41, Table 2) in the Cameroonian patients was detected at the HBS1L-MYB locus, rs9399137; leading to changes in median values of HbF of 10.6%, 10.3% and 8.7% for the C/C, C/T and TT alleles, respectively. We further explored whether the multiple variants at the HBS1L-MYB locus represented independent signals of association. Using stepwise regression, we found that rs28384513, rs9399137, rs9376090, rs9389269 rs9402686 and rs9494142 are independent association signals in the Cameroonian sample (Table S1 and Figure S1).\n\nWe disaggregated the patient sample, based on the HbF assessment technique (ADT vs HPLC), and found that the significant associations with HF levels, examined independently, were present in both sub-groups studied using the different assay methods, in rs11886868 (BCL11A), rs4671393 (BCL11A), rs28384513 (HMIP 1) and rs",

    "content": "Results\n\nSeven key genetic variants, rs6545816 and rs1427407 (BCL11A), rs9376090, rs66650371, rs9402686 and rs6920211 (HBS1L-MYB) and rs7482144 (XmnI-HBG2) were genotyped in 260 Nigerian SCA patients (summary data shown in Table 1) and their effects on HbF levels and other haematological parameters were investigated. The median HbF% of the cohort was 6.2 (inter-quartile range 3.42–9.70). The results of our genetic-association analysis are shown in Table 2 and genotypic values for HbF and other haematological parameters are plotted in Figs 1 and 2.\n\nBCL11A: The primary variant tagging this locus, rs1427407, was strongly associated with HbF levels (β = 0.47, p = 7 x 10−10) and also showed a marked influence on anaemia: median [Hb] was 8.2 g/dL for GG genotype patients, 8.6 g/dL for the GT genotype, and 8.9 g/dL for the TT genotype [p = 0.011] (Fig 2). The influence of this marker is enhanced by the high prevalence of the HbF-increasing allele ‘T’ (23%), an allele frequency typical for African populations and African patients with SCA. As previously observed in African American and Tanzanian patients, a second association signal at BCL11A (rs6545816) was detected when adjusting for the effect of the primary signal at rs1427407 (Table 3). Aligning alleles at the two variants into haplotypes (Fig 3) reveals the genetic architecture underlying this finding: the HbF-boosting allele (‘C’) for rs6545816 occurred solely on haplotypes/chromosomes carrying the low-HbF allele for the primary marker, rs1427407. Investigating human population data from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase III, we found that the HbF-boosting alleles for both markers were exclusively in such a repulsion phase alignment in African and Asian populations and that coupling phase (both high-HbF alleles united in cis) was exceedingly rare (found in 3 out of 5,008 individuals) across all human populations studied.\n\nHBS1L-MYB: Both known main HbF sub-loci in this region, HMIP-2A (tagged by rs66650371) and HMIP-2B (tagged by rs9402686) were significantly (p = 0.002 and p = 1.23 x 10−4, respectively) associated with HbF%, with similar allelic effects (β ~ 0.6). The 3-bp deleted allele of rs66650371 was also associated with increased haemoglobin levels. It was the only variant studied that had a significant effect on the red blood cell count. This marker was also strongly associated with lower platelet counts (Table 2, Fig 2). HbF-increasing alleles at HBS1L-MYB had low frequencies (3%), as is characteristic for African populations. Similar to the BCL11A locus, HbF-increasing alleles at the two sub-loci occurred within different haplotypes (Fig 2), which is typical for individuals of African descent. This stands in contrast to the situation in European populations, where HbF-increasing alleles usually appear to be combined into a single haplotype (HMIP-2AB). Accordingly, for an ancestry informative marker tagging this haplotype, rs9376090, we did not detect the ‘G’ allele, indicating the absence of HMIP-2AB haplotypes and suggesting a lack of European, Asian, or North African admixture in our patient cohort. Of all variants studied, rs9402686 had the largest allelic effect on HbF levels [β = 0.631, p = 1.23 x 10−4], resulting in median HbF values of 5.75% for the GG genotype and 13.8% for the GA genotype (the single person with AA genotype had an HbF of 4.2%) (Fig 1).\n\nXmnI-HBG2 (rs7482144): As it is typical for African populations, the rs7482144 ‘A’ allele that is associated with boosting HbF is infrequent (2%) among our patients. While a strong effect for this variant was seen in Tanzanian patients, we detected no association with HbF or general haematological parameters, most likely due to the small number of our patients that carry the ‘A’ allele, resulting in a lack of statistical power.\n\nHbF levels correlated positively with total haemoglobin [β = 0.05, p = 7.75 x 10−5] and MCV [β = 4.87, p = 6.70 x 10−7] but negatively with WBC [β = -0.093, p = 0.001] and platelet counts [β = -0.08, p = 0.047].",

The median referral age of this cohort was 7 years old, and the median age of BMF onset was 4 years old (range, 1–13 years old). There were 20 Han Chinese and one Uyghur Chinese, and the geographical distribution spread nationwide though over half of the patients came from the south or southwest of China. All patients were referred to our institute because of severe cytopenia except a thirty-year-old boy (Case 10) who was initially diagnosed as MDS for the myeloid dysplasia and increased myeloblasts indicated by BM morphology. Five patients had an indicative family history with two patients had family members died from anemia (Case 3, Case 15), two patients were from consanguineous families (Case 16, Case 21), and one patient was an in vitro fertilize baby whose paternal grandmother died from pancreatic cancer (Case 4) (Table 1). \n\nFourteen (66.67%) patients were growth-retarded, and 20 (95.24%) patients manifested as congenital malformations. Congenital abnormalities in our cohort included skin pigmentation (13/21), café au lait spots (5/21), spin and limbs deformation (11/21), craniofacial malformations (8/21), genitourinary system malformations (7/21), cardiovascular system defects (2/21), nervous system diseases (2/21), and endocrine system defects (2/21) (Table 1).\n\nThoroughly evaluation of the hematologic phenotype is crucial to FA patients since BM dysplasia or pathological cytogenetics relate to disease progression and adverse hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) outcomes. Twenty patients’ morphologic test results and nineteen patients’ cytogenetics test results before pre-HSCT conditioning regimen and/or chemotherapy were available. BM dysplasia was found in 13/20 (65%) patients, including one AML with the myeloblast count of 41% (Case 5) and one myelodysplasia with the blast count of 6% (Case 10). Karyotypes were described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature 2013; at least 20 metaphases were analyzed for each assay. Cytogenetic abnormalities were found in 8/19 (42.11%) patients with clonality found in five patients, and half of the abnormal karyotypes involved chromosome 7 (− 7, 7q-, or der(7)t(1;7)) (Table 2). The cytogenetic result of Case 5 who was diagnosed as AML was 46, XX, der(7)t(1;7)(q21;q36), which was confirmed to be non-constitutional by matched peripheral blood, and the karyotype of patient Case 10 was highly complex (Table 2). All the patients with abnormal karyotypes also manifested as dysplasia on bone marrow smear or had evident blasts, suggesting the initiation of clonal evolution in hematopoietic system. \n\nCharacteristics of mutations\n\nA total of 39 mutations were identified involving six different FA genes and composed of 13 missense mutations, nine large deletions, eight nonsense mutations, seven frameshift mutations, one splicing mutations, and one deep intron mutation (Fig. 1, Table 3). All the large deletions were found within the FANCA gene. 20 (47.73%) mutations identified in our cohort were novel and the majority of mutations were private except FANCA c.367C > T, which was shared by two patients.

We did not find FANCA c.2546delC in our cohort, which accounts for over 30% FANCA mutations in Japanese and Korean patients. \n\nAmong the 21 patients,15 patients carried compound heterozygous mutations, three patients carried homozygous mutations, two patients harbored hemizygous FANCB mutations, and one patient with a heterozygous FANCE mutation were identified. Biallelic FANCA mutations caused 61.90% (13/21) of the cases, followed by monoallelic FANCB mutations and FANCD2 mutations, which both constituted 9.52% (2/21) of the cases; and FANCC, FANCE, and ERCC4 mutations caused one case each (Table 3). We did not find any case attributed to FANCG mutations, which is the second most prevalent responsible gene in East Asian according to Japanese and Korean studies. Despite the limited size of this cohort, we identified two FANCB mutations, making it rank one of the most common causative genes in line with the Japanese study. There were three homozygous mutations, FANCA c.1867C > T, FANCC c.545C > A, and ERCC4 c.257G > A; the latter two mutations were carried by patients both came from consanguineous families, and the FANCC c.545C > A was carried by the only Uyghur patient in our cohort.\n\nRigorous criteria were adopted in the process of criminal variant identification (Table 3, Table S3). Majority of the patients were assigned with compelling mutations with two exceptions. All mutations were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic according to the guideline of ACMG.

The age of BMF onset of ALDH2-G/A patients was significantly younger than that of the ALDH2-G/G patients (p = 0.025, t-test).\n\nTreatment and outcome\n\nWithin the 21 patients, continuous medical records of 19 patients can be retrieved except Case 8 and Case 21, who only came to us once and were excluded in this section. All the 21 patients were eligible for HSCT for they were all transfusion-dependent, and HSCT was performed on 15 patients (71.43%). The numbers of patients accepted HSCT from HLA-matched unrelated donors (MUD), HLA-unmatched unrelated donors (UUD), HLA-haploidentical related (sibling or parental) donors (HRD), and HLA-matched related donors (MRD) were three, four, six, and one, respectively. Another patient accepted HLA-unmatched unrelated cord blood (UUC) HSCT. The other four patients who did not undergo HSCT accepted androgen, cytokine, and/or intermittent transfusion support. All the patients with abnormal karyotype underwent HSCTs. In the HSCT subgroup, 9/15 (60%) were ALDH2-G/A genotype. The median follow-up duration was 29 months ranged from 1 month to 68 months. By the end of the study, eight patients (38.10%) have been dead. Seven of them were HSCT-related, mainly severe acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and/or infections, accounting for 46.67% of the subgroup.

Results on FA pathway inactivation in pancreatic cancer cell lines have been previously reported and were confirmed, including defective FANCD2 monoubiquitination due to inactivating mutations in FANCG and FANCC in Hs766T and PL11, respectively, and defective RAD51 focus formation due to an inactivating FANCD1 mutation in Capan-1. Among all samples newly tested in the present study, we identified one cell line without detectable FANCD2 monoubiquitination, the HCC line HuH-7 (Fig. 1A). To stimulate previously undetectable FANCD2 monoubiquitination, HuH-7 cultures were pre-treated with mitomycin C (MMC) at 100 nM for 24 h. Despite such challenge, HuH-7 did not display any trace of monoubiquitinated FANCD2. RKO cells and derived clones harboring an engineered disruption of FANCG or FANCC were used as controls (Fig. 1B). Likewise, no FANCD2 focus formation was observed in HuH-7 after treatment with irradiation (IR) at 15 Gy 6 h prior to workup (Fig. 2A). In contrast, RAD51 focus formation was readily detectable (Fig. 2B), confirming a proximal FA pathway defect, whereas distal FA/BRCA pathway function remained undisturbed.\n\nGene complementation studies reveal defective FANCC function in HuH-7 cells\n\nTo identify the FA gene responsible for proximal FA pathway inactivation, HuH-7 cells were transduced with retroviral constructs containing full-length cDNAs of FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG or FANCL. FANCD2 monoubiquitination was assessed following exposure of the transduced cultures to MMC. Restoration of FANCD2 monoubiquitination was observed only after complementation of HuH-7 cells with the FANCC gene construct, whereas all other constructs had no discernible effect (Fig. 3A). Consequently, exogenous FANCC protein expression was confirmed in FANCC-transduced HuH-7 cultures (Fig. 3B). To validate functional FA pathway restoration upon transduction of FANCC-cDNA, the cell cycle profiles of the transduced cells were analyzed 48 h after treatment with MMC. The pronounced G2 arrest, observed in non-FANCC-complemented HuH-7 cells was restored to normal specifically after transduction with FANCC, but not after transduction with any of the other FA or control constructs (Fig. 3C).\n\nHuH-7 cells harbor a homozygous inactivating nonsense FANCC mutation in exon 6\n\nDirect genomic sequencing of the coding exons and adjacent intron portions of FANCC in HuH-7 revealed a homo- or hemizygous inactivating nonsense mutation c.553C > T, p.R185X in coding exon 6 (Fig. 3D). No other sequence changes were identified.\n\nAberrant splicing leads to a truncated FANCC mRNA lacking exon 6 in HuH-7 cells\n\nUsing reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with primers flanking a region that includes exon 6, we identified an additional truncated FANCC gene transcript in HuH-7 cells, which was not detectable in four HCC control cell lines Chang, Hep3B, HepG2 and PLCPRF5 (Fig. 3E). Upon gel-separation of the two RT-PCR products amplified from HuH-7 cDNA, direct sequencing confirmed that the correctly sized band represented the reference FANCC sequence except for the described c.553C > T nonsense mutation, while the smaller band represented the reference FANCC sequence lacking exon 6, leading to a direct exon 5/7 junction (Fig. 3F).\n\nHuH-7 cells are hypersensitive towards ICL-agents as compared to other HCC lines\n\nFive HCC cell lines (Chang, Hep3B, HepG2, HuH-7 and PLCPRF5) were treated either with common ICL-agents (MMC, cisplatin and melphalan) or with common non-ICL chemotherapeutics (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), etoposide and doxorubicin). The sensitivity towards ICL-agents was clearly dissimilar between the FA pathway-proficient cell line panel and FANCC-deficient HuH-7 cells, with the latter displaying a distinct hypersensitivity (inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) ratios ranging between 3.4 to 18.6 as compared to the other HCC lines) (Fig. 4A, upper panel). In contrast, treatment with non-ICL chemotherapeutics did not distinguish HuH-7 as being most sensitive (Fig. 4A, lower panel). The most consistent difference in ICL-agent sensitivity between the FA-pathway proficient HCC cell lines and FANCC-deficient HuH-7 cells was observed using melphalan. This agent has previously been described to have the strongest effect among 8 ICL-agents tested in an isogenic FA cancer cell model.

Cell cycle distributions of the five HCC cell lines, analyzed upon treatment with MMC for 48 h, revealed a pronounced G2 arrest (defined here by a fraction of >40% of cells in G2) at low MMC concentrations (25 nM) only in HuH-7 cells (Fig. 4B), whereas a similar G2 arrest was achieved in a dose-dependent manner in all HCC cell lines except PLCPRF5 at higher MMC concentrations (50 to 100 nM) (Fig. 4C).\n\nICL-hypersensitivity of HuH-7 cells is abrogated upon exogenous FANCC expression\n\nHuH-7 cells were stably transduced using retroviral constructs containing either full length FANCC-cDNA (HuH-7/FANCC), tagged with recombinant influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA-tag), or empty vector (HuH-7/ev). Consecutively, exogenous FANCC expression was confirmed (Fig. 5A). HuH-7/FANCC cells, but not parental HuH-7 or HuH-7/ev control cells, displayed restored proximal FA-pathway function as demonstrated by constitutive and MMC-inducible FANCD2 monoubiquitination (Fig. 5B) as well as proficiency in FANCD2 nuclear focus formation (Fig. 5C). Most importantly, sensitivity towards ICL-agents was significantly reduced in HuH-7/FANCC cells as compared to parental HuH-7 and HuH-7/ev control cells (Fig. 5D, upper panel), whereas sensitivity towards non-ICL-chemotherapeutics remained virtually unchanged (Fig. 5D, lower panel).\n\nNo evidence for inactivation of FANCC, FANCG or FANCF in 18 HCC tissue specimens\n\nTo assess the prevalence of proximal FA pathway inactivation in HCC, 18 surgical HCC tissue specimens were analyzed for inactivation of FANCC, FANCF or FANCG through screening for genetic mutations, epigenetic silencing through CpG hypermethylation or lack of mRNA-expression. On the genetic level, direct sequencing of the complete coding sequences of FANCC, FANCF and FANCG in 18 HCC samples identified a single not previously reported, heterozygous, synonymous FANCC sequence variant (c.813G > A) and two heterozygous, non-synonymous FANCG variants (c.20C > T, p.S7F; c.643C > A, p.Q215K) (Fig. 6A). No other sequence variants, especially no inactivating point mutations, small deletions, insertions, large intragenic deletions or complete homozygous gene deletions, were found. On the epigenetic level, HpaII-restriction assays yielded no evidence for FANCC-, FANCF- or FANCG-silencing through CpG hypermethylation (Fig. 6B) and consistently, FANCC-, FANCF- and FANCG-mRNA was detectable in all 18 HCC samples (Fig. 6C).",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nDescription of study cohort\n\nWe included 700 children with EoE, 868 children with atopic disease (asthma, AD, and/or AR but not EoE), and 801 community control subjects, 412 of whom were nonatopic (Table I). The EoE cohort was more male and slightly younger than the community cohort and slightly older than the atopic disease cohort.\n\nAtopic disease is enriched in patients with EoE\n\nTo determine the degree of atopic disease enrichment in patients with EoE, we compared patients with EoE with community control subjects (Table I). Atopic disease prevalence was markedly higher in children with EoE than in community control subjects (P < .0001). There was also marked enrichment for each atopic disease in patients with EoE (P < .0001). The prevalence of self-reported food allergy was high in patients with EoE and low in the community control subjects. Nearly half of the children with EoE were prescribed epinephrine (47.8%). In control subjects only 0.46% of the children reported food-induced anaphylaxis, which can be a proxy for clinically diagnosed food allergy. These data support an enrichment of atopic diseases in children with EoE.\n\nGenetic associations with EoE differ when using nonatopic and atopic disease control subjects\n\nWhen we compared patients with EoE with nonatopic control subjects (Fig 1 and see Table E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) across 372 SNPs in 63 genes, the strongest genetic associations with EoE were detected at the IL4/KIF3A locus: 10 SNPs were associated at a P value of less than 10−4, 5 of which were associated at a P value of less than 10−5 (OR range, 1.85-1.89). Although there are many associated variants in this locus, there is strong LD in this region, and thus these signals are not independent (see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). The TSLP locus exhibited association (best P = 1.5 × 10−4; OR, 1.43 for risk allele). Likewise, strong LD in this locus means these signals are not independent (see Fig E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). SNPs at CAPN14 exhibited nominal association (P = .029; OR, 1.35). In addition, SNPs in several other genes (SPINK5, SOCS3, CD14, and PDE4B) showed association (P < .01) with EoE. In contrast, when we compared patients with EoE with atopic disease control subjects (Fig 1 and Fig 2 and see Table II), the association between EoE and the IL4/KIF3A locus was nominally significant (best P = .019; OR range, 1.11-1.25). However, the association between TSLP SNPs and EoE persisted (best P = 4.7 × 10−5; OR, 1.37 for risk allele). Furthermore, association between EoE and the CAPN14 SNP strengthened (P = .0001; OR, 1.71).\n\nSNPs in several other genes (ST2, PDE4B, ADCY2, IL10, and HRNR) also exhibited association (P <.01) with EoE when using atopic disease control subjects (Table II). Notably, the strongest association with EoE when using atopic disease control subjects, the ST2 (IL1RL1) gene (P = 3.5 × 10−6; OR, 1.77), was not significant when using nonatopic control subjects (P = .30; OR, 1.17).\n\nCollectively, these results suggest that TSLP and CAPN14 genetic variation associate specifically with EoE, IL4/KIF3A is an atopic disease locus, and ST2 might require underlying atopic disease to associate with EoE. Importantly, IL4 and KIF3A are in strong LD (see Fig E1). Thus determining which of the 2 genes is responsible for the association cannot be achieved statistically. However, previous work has implicated IL4 in atopic responses including those in EoE, thereby justifying our focus on IL4.\n\nGene-gene interaction between IL4 and TSLP\n\nWe then tested whether the most strongly associated IL4 variant (rs2243250) interacted with TSLP and CAPN14 SNPs. In interaction analyses multiple TSLP SNPs exhibited significant interaction (best P = .0074, Fig 3). However, the interaction between IL4 and CAPN14 was not significant (P = .12). Given that the allele frequency is greater for TSLP SNPs than for CAPN14 SNP, it is possible that we were underpowered to detect an interaction between IL4 and CAPN14 SNPs. Several genes associated with EoE when using atopic disease control subjects (ST2, ADCY2, and IL10) also exhibited nominal evidence (P <.05) of interaction with IL4. Given the strength of interaction between IL4 and TSLP, we stratified by the presence or absence of the IL4 risk variant and showed that associations (both P values and ORs) of the TSLP SNPs with EoE were stronger when the IL4 risk variant was present (Fig 2). Similar effects were seen when evaluating KIF3A variants (data not shown).\n\nWhen evaluating the effect of inheriting no risk alleles",

Similar effects were seen when evaluating KIF3A variants (data not shown).\n\nWhen evaluating the effect of inheriting no risk alleles from IL4 and TSLP compared with only one or both, we found that inheriting a risk allele from one of these 2 genes was associated with modest risk increases (IL4: P = .004, OR of 1.55; TSLP: P = .10, OR of 1.25). However, children with risk alleles from both genes had a synergistic increased risk for EoE (P = 2.0 × 10−10; OR, 3.67). Of note, having risk alleles from both IL4 and TSLP compared with having neither risk allele is highly specific (90% adjusting for no covariates), supporting the fact that having both risk alleles is highly predictive of EoE. Notably, the sensitivity is low (26%, adjusting for no covariates), suggesting that not having both risk alleles does not rule out EoE. Taken together, these data suggest that the IL4 locus interacts with the TSLP locus to influence EoE risk.",

    "content": "Results\n\nCandidate variants in EoE\n\nThe schematic workflow for the WES analysis is depicted in Fig. 1a. We initially conducted WES on the DNA from an extended pedigree (discovery set), which included five subjects who had histologically confirmed EoE and were across multiple generations (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). WES identified two coincident, heterozygous, missense variants in desmoplakin (DSP) and periplakin (PPL) [DSP: p.G46D (c.137 G → A), PPL: p.V1377E (c.4130 T → A)] (Fig. 1a–b) only in affected family members. Both DSP and PPL are members of the plakin protein family that localize to desmosomes and are highly expressed in the esophagus (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). DSP and PPL are critical components of desmosome structures in epithelial cells, which are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of cell contacts and cell migration. Notably, DSP and PPL were expressed primarily in the squamous epithelium with strong relative expression in the esophageal mucosa (Supplementary Fig. 2). Subsequent Sanger sequencing of all 32 family members confirmed co-segregation of the two variants with each of the five affected members (Supplementary Fig. 1). Two additional members (#12 and #28) had both variants; #12 had a diagnosis of esophageal stricture, and #28 had reflux symptoms but had never undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (Fig. 1b). Potentially, both might have EoE. Additional family members had one variant, DSP or PPL. Co-segregation was found only in the variants in DSP and PPL, but not other candidate genes. The strong co-segregation of these variants supports a joint role of these variants in EoE etiology.\n\nFrequency of DSP and PPL mutations in EoE\n\nWe sequenced additional multiplex families (replication set), which included 61 index patients of European ancestry. In addition to the identified discovery variants (1 DSP, 1 PPL), we observed 6 DSP variants in six unique multiplex families (one variant per family) and 5 PPL variants in six other multiplex families (one variant shared by two families), which we confirmed by Sanger sequencing of all family members (genotype–phenotype concordance 78.3%, P = 0.005) (Fig. 1c). From the discovery and replication set, we identified a total of seven variants in DSP and six variants in PPL (Table 1, Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 3–4), which were present in 13 of 62 families with EoE (21.0%). Only the discovery family had identified coincident DSP and PPL variants. These 13 variants of DSP and PPL are exceedingly rare based on the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), predicted to have a deleterious effect on protein function and evolutionarily conserved (Supplementary Tables 2–5). For DSP variants, the mutant amino acids are within the plakoglobin binding site, plakin domain and homodimerization site (Fig. 1d). For PPL variants, the mutant amino acids are within the plakin domain and the rod domain that forms complexes with envoplakin (Fig. 1d).\n\nTo evaluate whether these rare variants in DSP and PPL were enriched in EoE compared to controls, we examined rare genetic burden tests by case-control association studies with the use of ExAC. At the variant level, three of the 13 variants were not in the ExAC database, and eight reached statistical significance (Table S6). At the gene level, the frequency of DSP or PPL variants in the index patients from the 62 EoE multiplex families were higher than that of a control cohort of European ancestry from the ExAC database (P = 0.0021, Fisher’s exact test) (Table 2). This result was replicated by an independent control cohort from the UK Biobank (P = 0.023, Fisher’s exact test) (Table 2). Although we found enrichment of rare variants in these genes, we did not see the joint segregation of those two variants in the replication set. Given the fact that DSP and PPL variants were seen in the control cohorts, we speculate that isolated DSP and PPL variants are not sufficient for the disease but cooperate with secondary hits in the desmosomal genes. In the case of the discovery family, the second hit is the co-occurrence of damaging variants in both DSP and PPL, whereas, in the replication families, the co-occurrence of the DSP or PPL variants with additional rare variants in other genes in the desmosome were enriched (P = 0.0052, Fisher’s exact test) (Table 2 and S7), providing evidence that rare genetic variants in the desmosomal genes associate with EoE.\n\nEsophageal DSP and PPL expression and associated features in EoE\n\nTo obtain further in vivo evidence of the relevance of EoE-associated mutations to disease manifestations, esophageal biopsy specimens obtained from familial EoE (62 multiplex families), non-familial EoE (511 non-multiplex families), and controls (93 individuals) (Table S8) were analyzed using approaches including quantifying peak esophageal eosinophil counts, EoE histology scoring system (HSS), EoE diagnostic panel (EDP), single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining.

    "content": ", esophageal biopsy specimens obtained from familial EoE (62 multiplex families), non-familial EoE (511 non-multiplex families), and controls (93 individuals) (Table S8) were analyzed using approaches including quantifying peak esophageal eosinophil counts, EoE histology scoring system (HSS), EoE diagnostic panel (EDP), single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining. Esophageal DSP and PPL expression were markedly lower in patients with active EoE than inactive EoE and controls (Fig. 2a), as was the expression of genes encoding other desmosomal proteins, such as DSG1 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Among patients with active EoE having similar esophageal eosinophil levels, familial EoE with an identified DSP or PPL variant had significantly lower DSP or PPL expression, respectively, than did non-familial EoE (Supplementary Fig. 5b). DSP and PPL expression correlated with each other (r = 0.854, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2a). Significant correlations were noted between each gene (DSP or PPL) and several genes involved in EoE, especially downregulated genes (Supplementary Fig. 5c). DSP expression is inversely correlated with TSLP expression, which is notable because reduced DSP mediates impaired barrier function, which is an upstream event in the induction of TSLP. TSLP is overexpressed in EoE and genetically and functionally linked with EoE. In this regard, it is also notable that patients with familial EoE harboring DSP or PPL variants expressed higher TSLP mRNA levels than did patients with non-familial EoE (2.1 fold, P = 0.001) (Fig. 2b); the difference in TSLP expression was independent of peak eosinophil levels in the esophagus. These data support a possible relationship between desmosome variants and the type 2 skewing and allergic responses observed in EoE.\n\nWith regard to EoE histologic features, DSP and PPL expression inversely correlated with structural features and eosinophilic features (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 6a for non-familial EoE). Of note, non-familial EoE showed histologic changes that varied with the severity of disease activity, whereas familial EoE demonstrated retained structural features, mainly driven by DIS, regardless of disease activity (Table S9). This differential histology between non-familial and familial EoE was independent of esophageal eosinophil levels—peak esophageal eosinophil counts were not significantly different between non-familial and familial inactive EoE nor between non-familial and familial active EoE (Supplementary Fig. 6b–c). These findings suggest that decreased DSP and/or PPL expression, via the presence of DSP and/or PPL variants in familial EoE, impairs the epithelial barrier and causes fixed histologic features independent of esophageal eosinophilia. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that DSP is highly expressed in the basal and differentiating epithelial cells, whereas PPL is highly expressed in the suprabasal and differentiated epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d–g). Notably, DSP and PPL protein expression were reduced in esophageal biopsies obtained from patients with DSP and/or PPL variants, respectively, regardless of disease activity (Fig. 2d, e and Supplementary Fig. 6d–g). Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human esophageal biopsies also revealed co-expression of DSP and PPL at the single epithelial cell level (Supplementary Fig. 7) in some of the epithelial cells.\n\nDSP and PPL deficiency in esophageal epithelial cells\n\nTo uncover the role of DSP and PPL in esophageal epithelial homeostasis, we generated DSP- and PPL-deficient human esophageal cell lines (EPC2 cells) via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated genome editing. We examined the effect of DSP and PPL deletion on the barrier integrity following air–liquid interface (ALI) culture (Supplementary Fig. 8a). DSP and PPL knockout (KO) cells demonstrated acantholysis and significantly decreased barrier function, the latter determined by reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran compared to control cells (Supplementary Fig. 8b–d). Moreover, DSP KO cells and PPL KO cells showed increased migratory ability following a physical cellular injury (Supplementary Fig. 8e). Taken together, DSP or PPL loss in esophageal epithelial cells modifies cell motility and barrier integrity.\n\nConsequences of EoE-associated DSP and PPL variants\n\nTo further investigate the consequences of the EoE-associated missense variants in DSP and PPL, we transduced EPC2 cells with constructs encoding non-variant and mutated variant DSP and PPL. Immunoblotting of the cell extracts showed that expression of all mutant DSP and PPL constructs were equivalent to that of the wild-type construct (Supplementary Fig. 9). We examined the effect of DSP and PPL variants on the barrier integrity following epithelial culture at the ALI. Impaired epithelial barrier integrity and reduced barrier function were observed in cells transduced with the mutated variants compared with the wild-type DSP and PPL (Fig. 3a–c).\n\nWe assessed epithelial cell reconstitution using a wound healing assay and found that cells transduced with the mutated variants closed the wound faster than did control cells trans",

Impaired epithelial barrier integrity and reduced barrier function were observed in cells transduced with the mutated variants compared with the wild-type DSP and PPL (Fig. 3a–c).\n\nWe assessed epithelial cell reconstitution using a wound healing assay and found that cells transduced with the mutated variants closed the wound faster than did control cells transduced with wild-type DSP and PPL (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 10). Notably, similar to mutated variants in this study, partial gene silencing and some of the known DSP mutations [p.R451G from arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and p.H586P from severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome] also showed increased cell motility (Supplementary Fig. 10b and d). In non-esophageal keratinocytes (HaCaT cells), there were similar mutational effects, although variability was observed (Supplementary Fig. 10d, e). Regarding a potential mechanism, the observed effects on cell motility in the wound healing assay were suggestive of aberrant RhoGTPase signaling, especially because it was reported that DSP knockdown cells have lower RhoA activity. To investigate whether desmosomal variants affect RhoGTPase signaling, we measured levels of GTP-bound RhoA (active RhoA). Of note, RhoA activity was reduced in most of the cells transfected with variant DSP or PPL compared to cells transfected with wild-type versions of these genes (Fig. 4a). Additionally, restoration of Rho activity (using the Rho activator calpeptin) rescued the enhanced migration. Furthermore, blocking Rho signaling (via the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632) further increased migration (Fig. 4b). Taken together, the RhoA pathway is likely associated with the DSP and PPL mutational effects. Indeed, we also demonstrated decreased active RhoA in biopsies from active EoE compared to that of inactive EoE and normal controls (Fig. 4c). Taken together, these data suggest that loss of function in epithelial homeostasis (by functional haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative effects of overexpressed mutant protein) is likely a relevant pathogenic mechanism.\n\nCalpain 14–mediated desmosomal protein degradation\n\nThe identified DSP and PPL variants associated with EoE are distinct from the pathogenic variants associated with other phenotypes such as arrhythmias. We aimed to understand the reason for the non-redundant phenotypes, i.e., esophageal but not other tissue involvement, in the EoE multiplex families having DSP and PPL variants. Of note, although we primarily observed missense mutations associated with EoE, more severe truncating mutations of DSP and PPL are associated with skin and heart diseases. Thus, we hypothesized that the identified genetic variants might interact with tissue-specific pathways through a post-translational mechanism. We have previously identified CAPN14 as an esophageal-specific functional protease that induces esophageal epithelial barrier impairment and loss of DSG1 expression, likely by a degradative mechanism. In this context, we hypothesized that cells carrying the DSP or PPL genetic variants might be more susceptible to CAPN14 proteolysis than cells carrying wild-type DSP or PPL. In order to test this hypothesis, we co-transfected expression vectors encoding CAPN14 with DSP (wild-type and mutant) or with PPL (wild-type and mutant). Cellular lysates were subsequently incubated with calcium to activate endogenous calpain; both DSP and PPL were degraded by co-transfection with CAPN14, but the degradation was less with the enzymatically inactive CAPN14-C101A, supporting that CAPN14 proteolysis contributes to this degradation (Fig. 5a). Of note, DSP and PPL mutants showed increased degradation compared to wild type (Fig. 5b). Considering the preferential expression of CAPN14 in esophageal mucosa (Fig. 5c) and its strong association with EoE, these results provide a potential mechanistic framework to understand the functional significance of the DSP and PPL mutants, as well as a potential mechanism that may link the observed esophagus-specific phenotype (compared to skin or heart disease phenotypes). Notably, CAPN14 mRNA expression in esophageal biopsies showed a trend of being lower in patients with familial EoE than non-familial EoE (P = 0.23) (Supplementary Fig. 11a). However, there was no difference in the allele frequency of a CAPN14-tagging SNP between families with or without DSP and/or PPL rare variants (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Finally, we hypothesized that inhibiting calpain activity would ameliorate the increased CAPN14-mediated degradation. We focused our attention on a pharmacologic drug with broad calpain inhibitory activity, using SNJ-1945, an agent designed to have high water solubility and bioavailability. Indeed, SNJ-1945 rescued cleavage by CAPN14 at least in part (Fig. 5d). Taken together, these findings provide a deeper molecular understanding of EoE pathogenesis and substantiate the potential therapeutic value of calpain inhibitors in modifying the identified genetic pathway.",

After screening and inclusion, 66 SNPs were identified in IBS patients (see Additional file 1: Table S1). Finally, 10 different SNPs from 28 studies were determined; references for these studies are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. The identified SNPs focus on neurotransmitter system (SLC6A4 5-HTTLPR, COMT rs4680 and GNβ3 rs5443) and the inflammation system (TNFα rs1800629, IL10 rs1800896, IL10 rs1800871, IL6 rs1800795, IL23R rs11465804, TNFSF15 rs4263839 and TNFSF15 rs6478108). Most of the studies reported that the DNA was extracted from blood, except for 2 studies that had DNA extracted from buccal epithelial cells and sputum. SNPs were assayed through PCR. The characteristics of these studies are shown in Additional file 1: Table S2. Rome III criteria was used in half of the studies (50% Rome III, 46.6% Rome II and 0.04% Rome I). Multiple comparisons of identified SNPs through five genetic models is summarized in Table 1.  \n\nSLC6A4 5-HTTLPR and IBS risk\n\nTwelve studies involving 1834 IBS subjects and 1941 controls were analyzed to determine the association of the SLC6A4 5-HTTLPR and IBS risk (Table 1). Genotype ls presented an increased risk for IBS development in HeM (ls vs. ll, OR = 2.312, 95% CI: 1.084–4.931, P = 0.03) (Fig. 2a). Heterogeneity for included studies is significant (P < 0.05). A sensitivity analysis, after excluding studies in turn, indicated that the associations remained (Fig. 2b). Begg’s test suggested no publication bias (P = 0.064). Thus, subgroup analysis based on ethnicity or diagnostic criteria was performed. Figure 2a shows that polymorphism was significantly correlated with IBS risk in Mongoloid population (OR = 20.68, 95% CI: 3.21–133.44, P = 0.001), but there was no association in Caucasian populations. No significant association was found in diagnostic criteria subgroups. Further, IBS subtypes (IBS-A, IBS-C and IBS-D) were analyzed but no association was found. \n\nCOMT rs4680 and IBS risk\n\nThree studies involving 414 IBS patients and 1363 controls were analyzed for the association of COMT rs4680 (G > A) and IBS risk (Table 1). GA genotype presented a decreased risk for IBS in the HeM (GA vs. GG, OR = 0.673, 95% CI: 0.5–0.907, P = 0.009) (Fig. 3a). Included studies were with a good homogeneity (I2 = 49%, P = 0.141). Subgroups analyses were conducted but no associations were found. \n\nIL10 rs1800896 and IBS risk\n\nSeven studies involving 955 IBS patients and 779 controls were analyzed for the association of IL10 rs1800896 (A > G) and IBS risk (Table 1). GG genotype presented a decreased risk of IBS in the RM (GG vs. GA+AA, OR = 0.806, 95% CI: 0.655–0.992, P = 0.042) (Fig. 3b). No significant heterogeneity (I2 = 14.3%, P = 0.321) was found. Further subgroup analysis was used for ethnicity and diagnostic criteria, but no additional associations were found.\n\nIL6 rs1800795 and IBS risk\n\nThere were four studies involving 1641 IBS patients and 1058 controls, which were analyzed for the association of IL6 rs1800795 (C > G) and IBS risk (Table 1). The data showed no association of allele or genotype with IBS risk. The AM (G vs. C) was used for subgroup analysis. This finding was interesting because there was no association of the G allele with IBS in the Caucasian subgroup, but in Caucasian subgroups with diagnostic Rome III criteria (Fig. 3c), the IL6 rs1800795 G allele significantly increased the risk for IBS (OR = 2.057, 95% CI: 1.313–3.225, P = 0.002).\n\nIL23R rs11465804 and IBS risk\n\nThere were four studies involving 2068 IBS patients and 1958 controls that analyzed the association of IL23R rs11465804 (T > G) and IBS risk (Table 1). The data showed no association of the polymorphism with IBS risk in any of the models. In subgroup analysis of IBS subtype, IL23R rs11465804 increased the risk for IBS-C both in AM (G vs. T, OR = 1.346, 95% CI: 1.025–1.767, P = 0.032) and DM (TG + GG vs. TT, OR = 1.338, 95% CI: 1.005–1.781, P = 0.046) (Fig. 3d).

A significantly positive association betweenTNFSF15 rs4263839 polymorphism and IBS development was found in AM (G vs. A, OR = 5.139, 95% CI: 3.859–6.844, P < 0.01), DM (GA + GG vs. AA, OR = 6.527, 95% CI: 4.616–9.229, P < 0.01), HoM (GG vs. AA, OR = 19.127, 95% CI: 15.395–23.765, P < 0.01) and HeM (GA vs. AA models, OR = 9.361, 95% CI: 4.702–18.637, P < 0.01).

Because all the subjects participating in these studies were Caucasian, only subgroup analysis of diagnostic criteria was performed, but the results suggested no correlations.\n\nSNPs had no association with IBS risk\n\nEight studies involving 1868 IBS patients and 1462 controls were analyzed for the association of TNFα rs1800629 (G > A), four studies involving 470 IBS patients and 485 controls were analyzed for the association of IL10 rs1800871 (T > C), four studies involving 724 IBS patients and 839 controls that analyzed the association of GNβ3 rs5443 (C > T) and IBS risk (Table 1).

Among active migraineurs 1,309 (39.6%) had migraine with aura and 1,997 (60.4%) migraine without aura. No history of migraine was reported by 21,008 women.\n\nThe baseline characteristics of women according to migraine status are summarized in Table 1. Women with any history of migraine were younger, less likely to have a history of diabetes, less physically active, less likely to consume alcohol, and less likely to smoke compared to women without migraine. In contrast women with migraine had a slightly higher body mass index. Further, they more frequently had a history of hypertension, used postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, had a history of oral contraceptive use, and had a family history of premature myocardial infarction.\n\nTable 2 summarizes the minor allele frequencies and p-values from the Fisher’s exact test for the Hardy Weinberg-Equilibrium for each of the 77 investigated polymorphisms. Six of the polymorphisms were not in Hardy Weinberg-Equilibrium based on a Bonferroni corrected p-value threshold of 0.00065 (ACE rs1799752, FGB rs1800790, TNF rs673, MS4A2 rs569108, CCR5 rs333, CSF2 rs25882, all p<0.0001).\n\nThree of the 77 polymorphisms were significantly associated with our primary outcome any history of migraine at the p=0.05 level (Table 3). The OR (95% CI; p-value) was 0.52 (0.30-0.89; p=0.017) for TNF rs673, 0.93 (0.89-0.98; p=0.009) for TGFB1 rs1800469, and 1.12 (1.03-1.21; p=0.007) for CCR2 rs1799864. After correction for multiple testing the FDR values were 0.43 (TNF rs673), 0.35 (TGFB1 rs1800469), and 0.35 (CCR2 rs1799864). This pattern remained unchanged for active migraine with and without aura. When we only looked at active migraine with and without aura three polymorphisms were associated with each subgroup (Table 3). For active migraine with aura the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals; p-value) were 1.35 (1.0-1.81; p=0.049) for TNF rs1800750, 1.13 (1.02-1.26; p=0.018) for TNF rs1800629, and 1.22 (1.07-1.40; p=0.004) for CCR2 rs1799864. The FDR values were 0.87 (TNF rs1800750), 0.69 (TNF rs1800629), and 0.31 (CCR2 rs1799864). For active migraine without aura the OR (95% CI; p-value) for TGFB1 rs1800469 was 0.9 (0.84-0.97; p=0.0076), for NOS3 rs3918226 1.13 (1.01-1.27; p=0.04), and for IL9 rs2069885 1.12 (1.02-1.24; p=0.02). (Table 3). The FDR value was 0.58 (TGFB1 rs1800469), 0.85 (NOS3 rs3918226), and 0.81 (IL9 rs2069885).\n\nIn summary, TNF rs673 was suggestive of a reduced risk for any history of migraine, but was not associated with any of the subgroups. Two polymorphisms (TNF rs1800750, TNF rs1800629) were associated with an increased risk for active migraine with aura, and two polymorphisms (NOS3 rs3918226, IL9 rs2069885) with an increased risk for active migraine without aura. In addition, two polymorphisms (TGFB1 rs1800469, CCR2 rs1799864) were associated with any history of migraine and one of the subgroups. TGFB1 rs1800469 appeared to reduce the risk for any history of migraine, a pattern that also occurred for active migraine without aura. In contrast, CCR2 rs1799864 appeared to raise the risk for any history of migraine, a pattern that was slightly more pronounced for active migraine with aura. However, none of the polymorphisms remained significantly associated when applying the FDR value.\n\nNone of the interaction terms between polymorphisms associated with the main outcome any history of migraine (TNF rs673, TGFB1 rs1800469, CCR2 rs1799864) and any of the covariates investigated was statistically significant.",

    "content": "Results\n\nClinical characterization of paradoxical psoriasis\n\nWe analyzed three patients affected by severe HS, and who developed paradoxical psoriasiform reactions following treatment with adalimumab. Patient 1, a 48‐year‐old Caucasian woman, showed nodules, fistulas and sinus tracts in the inguinal and perianal regions (Hurley III, Sartorius score: 41.5). After 3 months of therapy with anti‐TNF‐α, she developed psoriasiform eruptions (PASI 6.8), with pustular lesions and erythemato‐scaly lesions on the plantar region and lower limbs, respectively (Figure 1). A similar pattern of HS severity was observed in patient 2 (Hurley III, Sartorius score: 41.5), a 40‐year‐old Caucasian man, showing erythematous‐pustular lesions in the palmo‐plantar regions and erythemato‐scaly plaques on the legs and scalp, ascribed to psoriasiform dermatitis (PASI 5.2), arising after 2 months treatment with adalimumab (Figure 1). He concomitantly showed alopecia areata on the scalp and some eczematous‐like skin lesions. Patient 3, a 27‐year‐old Caucasian man, was affected by severe HS (Hurley III, Sartorius score: 61.5) characterized by comedones, nodules, and fistulas in the inguinal, gluteal and abdominal regions. He developed pustular lesions in the palmo‐plantar regions, and erythemato‐scaly plaques on the legs, scalp, elbows, and trunk (PASI 5.6) after 3 months of biological therapy (Figure 1). He refused to undergo a punch biopsy and, therefore, we could not perform the histological and immunological analyses. Paradoxical psoriasis regressed in all patients when adalimumab was discontinued. Interestingly, all three patients examined had a positive family history for psoriasis and, additionally, patient 1 reported other cases of HS among first‐degree relatives.\n\nHistological examination of the psoriasiform lesions of patients 1 and 2 showed epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, papillary vessel ectasia and perivascular infiltrate compatible with a psoriasiform dermatitis (Figure 1). A CD15+ neutrophilic infiltrate was abundant in the dermal compartment and present in corneal abscesses (Figures 1 and 2). Interestingly, some eczematiform spongiotic areas overlapping with the psoriasis‐like histological pattern were present in the skin lesions of patient 2.\n\nInnate immunity cells highly infiltrate paradoxical psoriasiform lesions\n\nLeukocyte subpopulations were characterized in paradoxical psoriasiform lesions, and compared to those present in classical plaque‐type psoriasis. In line with previous studies 19, 33, paradoxical psoriasis exhibited a prominent infiltrate of BDCA2+ pDCs in the dermis, significantly more abundant than in classical psoriasis (~2.7‐fold increase). In parallel, a significant increase of CD15+ neutrophils, c‐kit/CD117+ mast cells, CD68+ macrophages and monocytes in the dermis of paradoxical skin reactions was observed (~3.8‐, 3.5‐, and 1.8‐fold increase, respectively) (Figure 2). In contrast, CD3+ cells were similar and CD11c+ DCs were less abundant (~1.5 fold‐decrease) (Figure 2).\n\nWe next evaluated the local expression of psoriasis‐related cytokines, such as IL‐17A, IFN‐γ, and IL‐22, as well as IL‐36γ which is highly released by neutrophils 27. As shown in Figure 3, IFN‐γ immunoreactivity decreased in psoriasiform reactions of patients 1 and 2, as compared to classical psoriasis, whereas IL‐22 positivity was significantly augmented in the infiltrate, in particular in cells with a macrophage‐like morphology (~2.1‐fold increase). Due to the numerous neutrophils present in the dermis of paradoxical reactions, IL‐36γ positivity was also enhanced, compared to classical psoriasis. However, IL‐36γ expression in the epidermal compartment was similar (Figure 3). FACS analysis of the T‐cells isolated from skin biopsies confirmed a significant reduction of IFN‐γ+ CD3+ cells in patients 1 and 2, when compared to CD3+ cells isolated from classical psoriasis (~7‐ and 1.7‐fold decrease, respectively) (Figure 4). The reduction of IFN‐γ positivity was also observed in circulating CD3+ cells of patients 1 and 2. Similarly, TNF‐α positivity was lower in skin T‐lymphocytes of patients 1 and 2. TNF‐α positivity of circulating CD3+ cells was instead lower only in patient 1, as compared to patient 2 and patients with classical psoriasis (Figure 4). Moreover, IL‐17A positivity was comparable in patient 1 and psoriatic patients, whereas it was very high in T cells isolated from the skin of patient 2, where a mixed population of T cells, responsible for either the psoriasiform or eczematous reactions, is likely present (Figure 1). IL‐22 was similar in T cells of psoriasiform lesions and classical psoriasis, whereas it was substantially reduced in PBMCs (Figure 4). CD3+ cells from skin biopsies of HS patients were enriched in CD8+, but not in CD4+ cells, when compared to PBMC isolated from the same patients. CD3+ skin",

CD3+ cells from skin biopsies of HS patients were enriched in CD8+, but not in CD4+ cells, when compared to PBMC isolated from the same patients. CD3+ skin T cells of classical psoriasis showed instead an enrichment of both CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations (Figure 4).\n\nOverexpression of innate immunity molecules in paradoxical psoriasis\n\nSince we found that the inflammatory infiltrate pattern in paradoxical psoriasis strongly resembles that present in acute psoriasis, we next analyzed selected innate immunity molecules potentially involved in the triggering of psoriasis. As shown in Figure 5A, the type I IFN‐β was expressed in paradoxical skin lesions, mainly in keratinocytes, at levels significantly higher than classical psoriasis (~1.9‐fold increase). IFN‐β expression was also detected in cells with a T‐cell‐ and DC‐like morphology, as well as in endothelial cells. The epidermis of psoriasiform reactions was also immunoreactive for IFN‐κ, another keratinocyte‐derived type I IFN 34. IFN‐κ expression was similar in the two psoriasis conditions, even if it showed different subcellular localization within keratinocytes, being cytoplasmic in psoriasiform lesions and membrane‐bound in classical psoriasis (Figure 5A). IFN‐κ staining was also present in cells with a monocyte‐ or DC‐like morphology, at comparable levels in classical and nonclassical psoriasis (Figure 5A). Similarly to IFN‐β, IFN‐α2a and IFN‐λ1, but not IFN‐λ2 and IFN‐λ3, were greatly increased in paradoxical psoriasis, as compared to plaque psoriasis (Figure 5B and data not shown). Of note, LL‐37 was strongly expressed in psoriasiform skin lesions, at levels higher than classical psoriasis (Figure 5B). We finally investigated LT‐α and LT‐β, two members of the cytokine TNF family, also known as TNF‐β and TNF‐C 35, possibly deregulated by anti‐TNF‐α therapy. Both lymphotoxins were strongly overexpressed in paradoxical skin reactions, especially in keratinocytes of the basal layer epidermis.\n\nAs a whole, these data reveal the presence of an overexpressed innate immunity pattern in the skin of HS patients with paradoxical psoriasis.\n\nSNP characterization in HS patients developing paradoxical psoriasis\n\nIn order to understand whether paradoxical reactions of HS patients had a genetic basis, we analyzed a number of SNPs predisposing to psoriasis. Among them, we studied SNPs frequent in the psoriatic population, such as polymorphisms of the HLA‐C and HLA‐B regions and the ERAP1 gene. We also analyzed genetic variants of pathogenic cytokines, receptors and signal transducers (i.e. TNF‐α, IL‐17F, IL‐17RA, IL‐23R, IL‐12B, IKBζ, A20, A20 binding protein, Tyk2), and of skin‐barrier proteins (i.e. CDSN, CCHCR1) (see supplementary material, Table S1). All HS patients showed variants of ERAP1 and the HLA‐C region, either homozygosis or heterozygosis (Table 1). Three SNPs in ERAP1 (rs30187/rs30186/rs26653) and nine variants in HLA‐C (rs114395371/rs9264942/rs10484554/rs2524095/rs28383849/rs9264944/rs2853922/rs147538049/rs9264946) were, in fact, found in all patients, with SNPs distributed differently in the three patients. None of them showed the classical HLA‐Cw6 allele, even though patients 1 and 3 carried three point SNPs (rs2524095/rs2853922/rs386698994) mapping near the HLA‐Cw6 SNP position (rs17192540) (Table 1). In contrast, patient 2 mostly showed genetic polymorphisms (rs9264942/rs10484554/rs28383849/rs9264944/rs147538049/rs9264946) present in the genomic region containing a second variant of HLA‐Cw6 (Table 1). All HS patients carried SNPs in NFKBIZ (rs3217713) and TNFAIP (rs610604) genes, encoding IKBζ and A20 proteins respectively. Interestingly, patient 3 showed the higher number of psoriasis‐related SNPs, and shared a number of SNPs with patient 2 (rs7637230/rs4819554/rs3132554/rs10542126/rs3130983), and rs280519 with patient 1 (Table 1). Patient 3 also carried two other SNPs in CDSN (rs1062470/rs707913) and three SNPs in CCHCR1 (rs1576/rs130079/rs746647) (Table 1).\n\nAlthough rs11209026 in the IL23R gene has been previously associated with paradoxical psoriasiform reactions to anti‐TNFs 36, we could not find this SNP in any of the HS patients. Two other SNPs in IL23R, rs72676067, and rs1004819, were instead detected in patients 2 and 1,",

    "content": "Results\n\nInitially, 64 SNPs from nine candidate genes encoding proteins related with DA neurotransmission were genotyped [see Additional File 1]. Fourteen SNPs were excluded from statistical analysis after data depuration in the first population: ten had genotype call rates <90%, one was monomorphic and three were in strong LD with other SNPs (r2 > 0.85, [see Additional File 1]). The 50 remaining SNPs had MAF>0.12 and were in HWE in control population 1 (P > 0.01; [see Additional File 2]). After the exclusion of individuals with low genotyping rate, population 1 consisted of 263 patients and 274 controls, and population 2 was composed of 259 patients and 287 controls. No evidence of population stratification was found in any of the two populations studied by applying the STRUCTURE software [see Additional File 3], the Fst coefficient (theta = 0, 99%CI = 0.000-0.001 for population 1 and theta = 0, 99%CI = 0.000-0.002 for population 2) and the method by Pritchard and Rosenberg (P = 0.57 for population 1 and P = 0.05 for population 2).\n\nIn the single-marker analysis, genotype and allele frequencies were compared between patients and controls in population 1 [see Additional File 2]. Six SNPs within five genes (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DBH and TH) displayed P-values < 0.05 (table 1). Two of them, rs2283265 in DRD2 and rs2070762 in TH, remained significant after applying a FDR of 10% (Table 1A) and were further considered for the multiple-marker analysis. No SNP withstood the restrictive Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. For these two SNPs we sought to detect a specific association with either one of the clinical subtypes, MO or MA. We found that in population 1, DRD2 rs2283265 was associated wit both MO and MA, while TH rs2070762 was only associated with MO (Table 1B).\n\nThe analysis of all possible allelic combinations within the DRD2 gene revealed a five-marker haplotype (rs12363125-rs2283265-rs2242592-rs1554929-rs2234689) associated with migraine (best adjusted P-value = 0.00889; Table 2), with an over-representation of the T-C-G-C-G allelic combination in cases (OR = 1.85, 95%CI = 1.13-3.04, P = 0.0139) and the C-A-A-C-C haplotype in controls (OR = 1.88, 95%CI = 1.25-2.82, P = 0.00199; Table 3). The T-C-G-C-G haplotype carriers displayed an OR of 1.74 (95%CI = 1.06-2.88, P = 0.0277). In order to investigate if the association was specific of MO or MA, we compared the risk haplotype carrier frequencies between controls and each migraine subgroup separately. Although the frequencies were different (10.6% controls, 17.7% MO, 16.4% MA), they only reached borderline significance in MO (P = 0.042), while no significant differences were found in MA (P = 0.12). We performed a second-stage replication study in an independent Spanish case-control cohort to test these positive findings. The frequency of the risk haplotype T-C-G-C-G (rs12363125-rs2283265-rs2242592-rs1554929-rs2234689) carriers in population 2 was compared between 259 patients and 287 controls. Control carrier frequencies were very similar to those obtained in population 1 (10.4% control population 2 and 10.8% control population 1), whereas case carriers were more frequent in population 1 (17.1%) than in population 2 (14.3%). Thereby, the differences between cases and controls in population 2 did not reach significance (P = 0.22).\n\nMultiple-marker analysis of the two SNPs (rs6356 and rs2070762) in TH showed a different overall distribution between cases and controls (best adjusted P-value = 0.015, Table 2), due to an over-representation the A-C allelic combination in cases (P = 0.037, OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 0.94-1.90), and G-T in controls (P = 0.00573, OR = 1.47, 95%IC = 1.11-1.94; Table 3). However, individual haplotype assignation did not identify differences in the frequency of risk haplotype carriers between cases and controls. Moreover, the analysis of rs6356-rs2070762 haplotype distributions in cases and controls of population 2 found no evidence of association with migraine (table 3).\n\nFinally, we aimed to determine whether those variants nominally associated with the disease phenotype in population 1 after the single-marker analysis, could be replicated in population 2, especially rs2283265 in the DRD2 gene and rs2070762 in the TH gene, which maintained significance after FDR correction in the initial analysis.

    "content": "Results\n\nStudy design\n\nOur study design, summarized in Figure 1, was not standardized because the screening process for donors and PC patients was not implemented simultaneously with that for CFS patients. We employed different methods to detect XMRV nucleic acids at different stages of the study, but the same Ab-screening test was used consistently throughout. All plasma samples were screened for XMRV Abs by immunoblot assay to calculate the serological prevalence of XMRV. Plasma samples of viral Ab-positive PC patients were further screened for XMRV RNA. Moreover, PBMCs of PC patients whose plasma was positive for XMRV RNA were examined for the presence of XMRV genes and for RNASEL mutations in genomic DNA. Plasma samples of CFS patients were simultaneously screened for XMRV Abs and genomic DNA according to published methods. We did not examine XMRV DNA or RNA in the donor blood samples because, at present, the Japanese Red Cross Society does not have consensus for the genetic analysis of donor blood samples for research purposes, except for the analysis of blood types.\n\nScreening for XMRV Abs\n\nTo examine Abs against XMRV by immunoblotting, concentrated viral particles were used as antigens. When the same volume of XMRV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 lysate as a negative control was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and gel staining, we observed a comparable amount of Gag CA proteins in each preparation (Figure 2A, asterisks). The minimum amount of each virus lysate in which CA protein was detectable by gel staining with SYPRO ruby (3 μl) was used to assess sensitivity of the immunoblot assay by end point dilutions of an anti-Gag monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone R187; Figure 2B, left) or an anti-Env rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) (Figure 2B, right). The detection limit of the screening assay was estimated as 6.3 ng/ml (1:640,000) for R187 mAb and 1.1 μg/ml (1:8,000) for anti-Env pAb.\n\nIn the Ab screening, we observed many nonspecific signals. Most of these reacted with both strips at the same mobility, and some weak bands were occasionally detected on either XMRV or HIV-1, or both strips at the position of the CA proteins, probably because of a large amount of CA protein on the strips. Therefore, we regarded such nonspecific signals as false positives, and considered that a band observed on the XMRV strip, but not on the HIV-1 strip, showing signal intensity comparable with that detected using the control anti-Gag mAb was positive for XMRV when the strips were blotted with 100 times-diluted plasma samples (red squares in Figure 2C-E). We identified 12 positive plasma samples: eight from the donors, two from PC patients and two from CFS patients. The prevalence of XMRV calculated from the immunoblot assay was 1.6% in blood donors, 3.0% in PC patients, and 2.0% in CFS patients (p > 0.05). Because XMRV was originally identified in PC samples, we analyzed whether there was a gender difference in the prevalence of XMRV; however, no significant difference between male and female subjects was noted (Table 1).\n\nCharacterization of screening-positive Abs\n\nBecause we observed Abs against only the Gag CA protein in the Ab-screening assay, we examined test plasma for reactivity against recombinant Gag and Env proteins (Figure 3A-3C). For recombinant Gag protein, we expressed glutathione S transferase (GST)-fused Gag CA protein of XMRV derived from 22Rv1 cells. The sensitivity of the immunoblot assay using the GST-CA protein was about eight times higher than that used in the screening assay (Figure 3A, 1:5,120,000 dilution corresponding to 0.78 ng/ml R187 mAb). All screening-positive plasma, but not screening-negative plasma, tested positive for GST-CA proteins (Figure 3B), suggesting that the screening-positive plasma specifically recognized XMRV CA. In the upper panel of Figure 3B, D51, P24 and C32, plasma shows some signals migrating close to that of the Env surface subunit (SU). However, these were likely to be nonspecific as we observed similar signals on the paired HIV strip at the same position in the screening immunoblot assay (data not shown for D51, and Figure 2D and 2E for P24 and C32, respectively). We examined the reactivity of the test plasma against a recombinant histidine-tagged Env surface subunit protein (rSU) of a xenotropic MLV, in which the detection limit determined by endpoint dilutions was 1.1 μg/ml (1:8,000 dilution in Figure 3C, left), but detected no Abs against the Env SU protein in plasma samples (Figure 3C, right). An immunoblot assay after native-PAGE was also negative for Abs against Env proteins (Figure 3D). Detection limits in the native-PAGE were 6.3 ng/ml for anti-Gag mAb (R187) and 8.5 μg/ml for anti-Env pAb (data not shown).\n\nTo examine the specificity of the screening-positive plasma samples, we performed an additional immunoblot assay against proteins from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), which has approximately 83% amino acid homology in the Gag region with XMRV.

Detection limits in the native-PAGE were 6.3 ng/ml for anti-Gag mAb (R187) and 8.5 μg/ml for anti-Env pAb (data not shown).\n\nTo examine the specificity of the screening-positive plasma samples, we performed an additional immunoblot assay against proteins from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), which has approximately 83% amino acid homology in the Gag region with XMRV. We observed multiple patterns of cross-reactivity (Figure 3E). Most screening-positive plasma samples were recognized exclusively with XMRV Gag CA (e.g., patient 24 in Figure 3E), but some showed weak cross-reactivity with Gag CA of MoMLV (donor 359 in Figure 3E). In another case, almost the same level of signal was detected against Gag CA of XMRV and MoMLV (donor 385 in Figure 3E). Plasma that predominantly reacted with MoMLV Gag was not observed. The Ab specificities are summarized in Table 2.\n\nThe serological prevalence of XMRV calculated using only the highly specific Ab was 1.0% in the donors, 1.5% in PC patients, and 1.0% in CFS patients. Again, there were no statistically significant differences in prevalence between blood donors and patients with either PC or CFS. We are unable to determine whether the anti-Gag CA Abs we identified would indicate XMRV infection or not, until panel plasma or serum samples collected from human subjects definitely infected with XMRV become available. Therefore, we tentatively regard those individuals who retain these Abs as suspicious cases.\n\nDetection of XMRV RNA in the plasma of PC patients\n\nIn April 2008, we examined XMRV RNA from the plasma of two screening-positive PC patients (P24 and P28) by nested RT-PCR: only one patient (P24) had positive results for XMRV RNA with Gag-specific primers (Figure 4A). The sequence of the amplified PCR product was 99.8% (412/413), identical to that of XMRV VP62 (data not shown). However, we could not conclude that the PCR product was derived from XMRV infection because this fragment did not contain an XMRV-specific 24 nucleotide deletion in the gag region. The patient's malignant prostate tissue was not available because it had already been removed and was not deposited in the hospital.\n\nIn August 2008, we collected whole blood from this patient to examine RNASEL mutations at amino acid positions 462 and 541, and found a WT residue at 462 and a low-risk amino acid residue (Glu) at 541 (data not shown). We tried to isolate infectious or full-length XMRV from PBMCs of this patient, but were unsuccessful. We also found that the test results of the nested PCR assay, in which detection limit was approximately 1.5 cell equivalents of genomic DNA from 293T cells infected with 22Rv1 cell-derived XMRV (Figure 4B), using PBMC-extracted genomic DNA were not reproducible (Figure 4C). In November 2009, the whole blood of P24 became available again and was tested for XMRV DNA and RNA. Although the plasma still tested positive for Abs against XMRV Gag CA, neither XMRV RNA nor DNA was detected with the same method used in April 2008 (data not shown). We further examined XMRV RNA from plasma and supernatants of co-cultured P24 PBMCs with LNCap-FGC cells using one-step RT-PCR, but both tested negative for the XMRV Gag gene (Figure 5A). We performed real time PCR on genomic DNA extracted from PBMCs, which is capable of amplifying a fragment of the Env gene with a detection limit of four copies/reaction, but the additional PCR tests of P24 were negative for the XMRV gene (Figure 5B and 5C). These data suggested that the amount of XMRV in the blood of the Ab-positive PC patient was limited, if the virus still existed. Alternatively, it remains possible that the results of the original P24 PCR tests were false positive.\n\nDetection of XMRV DNA in PBMCs of CFS patients\n\nTo examine the prevalence of XMRV in CFS cases, we screened CFS patients for XMRV DNA in PBMCs at three independent laboratories. Figure 6 shows the representative results with two primer sets. The sensitivities of our PCR tests with primer sets indicated in Figure 6A were determined using genomic DNA extracted from 293T cells infected with 22Rv1 cell-derived XMRV (Figure 6B and 6C). The detection limit of both PCR tests was calculated as approximately 1.5 cell equivalents of genomic DNA from 293T cells infected with 22Rv1 cell-derived XMRV. In screening PCR tests, we observed several nonspecific bands but the XMRV gene was not amplified as shown in Figure 6D. Although bands of a similar size to that expected were occasionally observed, sequencing analysis indicated that they contained human genomic DNA rather than XMRV genes (data not shown).\n\nIn the Japanese Red Cross Osaka Blood Center, we performed nested RT-PCR analysis of the gag region by using plasma RNA (Figure 5A), and a real-time TaqMan PCR assay of genomic DNA to amplify the env region (data not shown) if the patients tested positive for Abs. We observed no positive results from the PCR assays performed at the three independent laboratories or this additional PCR test, indicating that there were no detectable amounts of XMRV DNA in the blood of CFS patients, although two of 100 patients",

The patients and controls were 62.77 and 62.79 years of age on average, respectively. No significant inter-group differences were identified in age, BMI, and serum phosphorus levels. In addition, the distributions of smokers and drinkers in the case group were comparable to those in the control group, whereas serum calcium, L2-L4 BMD, and T-scores were significantly lower in the osteoporotic patients versus controls (P<0.05).\n\nThe analysis of GREM2 gene variants\n\nTable 2 presents the genotypes and allele distributions of GREM2 rs11588607 and rs4454537 polymorphisms. The HWE testing revealed no obvious deviation in genotypic frequency in the controls, indicating that these subjects were representatives of the local population. GREM2 rs11588607 polymorphism exhibited negative correlation with the risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis under five models. Logistic regression analyses showed that CC genotype of rs4454537 polymorphism markedly elevated the risk of osteoporosis (CC vs. TT: OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.01–3.38, P=0.047) (Table 2). Furthermore, the C allele of rs4454537 polymorphism was correlated with a higher risk of osteoporosis (C vs. T: OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01–1.65, P=0.041) (Table 2). Subgroup analyses were conducted in terms of age, BMI, smoking, and drinking status. No significant association was observed with the risk of osteoporosis in any subgroup for rs11588607. However, there was a significantly higher risk of osteoporosis in BMI < 25 kg/m2 (Table 3).\n\nNext, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of GREM2 rs4454537 polymorphism were compared between the osteoporotic patients and the healthy controls (Table 4). There were no significant differences between the three genotypes of rs4454537 polymorphism in terms of age, BMI, serum calcium and phosphorus levels, and T-scores. However, for osteoporosis, the L2-L4 BMD of the CC genotype was significantly lower than the TT genotype, indicating that GREM2 rs4454537 polymorphism showed a significant correlation with L2-L4 BMD.\n\nGREM2 mRNA expression in different genotype\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the effect of GREM2 gene polymorphisms on the GREM2 expression. For rs11588607, there is no significant difference among three genotypes with regard to the GREM2 levels (Figure 1A). However, our results indicated that the up-regulation of GREM2 were observed in CC genotype than those in TT genotype of rs4454537 polymorphism (Figure 1B).\n\nAssociation of GREM2 rs4454537 polymorphism with fracture risk\n\nThe present study also investigated whether GREM2 rs4454537 polymorphism was linked to the risk of osteoporotic fracture since this polymorphism conferred susceptibility to osteoporosis (Table 5). The genotype distribution of rs4454537 polymorphism was statistically comparable between osteoporotic patients with and without fracture, indicating no statistical correlation with fracture.",

This SNP did not show significant genotypic association with any of the phenotypes evaluated, so inclusion of this SNP did not alter the results or interpretation of the reported associations with symptom subgroups or colonic transit.\n\nAssociation in Overall Cohort of Individual Candidate SNP with Symptom Phenotypes and Transit Measurements\n\nKLB rs17618244 was significantly associated with colonic transit at 24h (primary endpoint) in the overall cohort after correction for multiple comparisons (GC24 2.78±0.09 for GG vs. 2.36±0.11 for AA/AG genotype; p=0.0007, Bonferroni cutoff α=0.0033). The strength of the association detected between KLB rs17618244 genotype and GC24 was virtually the same after adjusting for prior cholecystectomy status.\n\nKLB rs17618244 was also associated with numerically faster secondary endpoints of colonic transit at 8h (GC8 1.63±0.09 for GG vs. 1.32±0.09 for AA/AG, p=0.023) and 48h (GC48 for GG 3.84±0.09 vs. 3.47±0.13 for AA/AG, p=0.025). No other significant associations were found between individual SNPs and gastric and small bowel transit.\n\nNo significant associations with symptom-based subgroup status of subjects (IBS subtypes and healthy volunteers) were detected.\n\nAssociation of KLB SNP rs17618244 with Colonic Transit in IBS Subtypes\n\nThe IBS-D subgroup exhibited the strongest association of KLB rs17618244 with faster colonic transit at 24 and 48 hours (GC24h: 3.50±0.14 for GG vs. 2.76±0.19 for AA/AG, p=0.0018; GC48 4.57±0.15 vs. 3.94±0.20, p=0.0113; Bonferroni cutoff α=0.0125) (Fig. 2). The strength of the associations detected between KLB rs17618244 genotype and either GC24 or GC48 in the IBS-D subgroup alone was not appreciably altered after adjusting for prior cholecystectomy status. No significant associations were found with colonic transit (24 or 48 hours) in the other 3 groups (all p>0.21, Fig. 2).\n\nInteraction between KLB SNP rs17618244 and 3 FGFR4 SNPs in Individual IBS Subtypes\n\nKLB interacts biochemically with FGFR4 to promote FGF19-mediated suppression of BA synthesis. Therefore, within each symptom subgroup, the potential interactions between KLB rs17618244 and each of 3 SNPs within the FGFR4 gene coding region were assessed. Significant interactions between combinations of KLB rs17618244 with FGFR4 rs351855, and separately, of KLB rs17618244 with FGFR4 rs1966265, were observed for GC24 in the IBS-D subgroup (p=0.0023 and p=0.0025, respectively; Bonferroni cutoff α=0.0042) (Fig. 3a and 3b).\n\nFunctional Analysis of KLB SNP rs17618244\n\nA protein stability assay for protein products of the 2 alleles of KLB SNP rs17618244 (Fig. 4a) showed that KLB Arg728 has a half-life of about 3 hours using an exponential decay best-fit curve (Fig. 4b). In contrast, KLB Gln728 showed signal intensity over 90% of the starting signal both at 6 hours (Fig. 4b) and at 10 hours of CHX treatment (Fig. 4a), suggesting that KLB Gln728’s half-life is >10 hours. The parameter estimates for the KLB Arg728 and KLB Gln728 curves were significantly different using an exponential decay model (p=0.026), as well as the linear model (p=0.008).",

    "content": "Results\n\nWe used MR to infer causal relationships between an exposure (e.g. altered gene expression or methylation) and an outcome (CeD). Since SNP alleles are randomly assigned to each individual, MR assumes that if an exposure is implicated in disease etiology, then the genetic variants associated with the exposure (eQTL/mQTL SNPs) will be associated with disease risk. Thus, confronting eQTL/mQTL (SNP–gene expression/methylation) and GWAS (SNP–disease) results, we can select those genes whose expression or methylation is altered by a SNP allele that in turn has been shown to increase the risk of developing the disease.\n\nTherefore, in order to identify the causative genes driving GWAS associations, we first ran the summary-data-based MR (SMR) software (https://cnsgenomics.com/software/smr) using results from the to-date largest CeD GWAS (9451 cases and 16 434 controls) and from the Consortium for the Architecture of Gene Expression (CAGE) eQTL database (P < 1e-5) (namely, genotype to transcription approach or G2T). We also ran SMR with the top blood mQTLs (P < 1e-5; n = 1366) available at the SMR website to test the association of DNA methylation with CeD and detect possible effects of SNPs on methylation (G2M) or of methylation on the expression of nearby genes (M2T) and finally considered the intersection of these three analyses (G2T∩G2M∩M2T) (Fig. 1A).\n\nThe G2T analysis using the CAGE blood eQTL database identified 8 SNPs associated with the expression levels of 10 different Illumina probes representing 8 genes, namely CD247, UBE2L3, MMEL1, ANXA6, TAGAP, PLEK, SIRT1 and PARK7 (Table 1; Fig. 1B; Supplementary Material, Table 1.1). The G2M analysis resulted in 51 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites pleiotropically related to 27 CeD-associated SNPs (Supplementary Material, Table 1.2). On the other hand, the M2T analysis considered methylation of nearby CpG sites to mediate the association between a given SNP and the expression of a particular gene and therefore identified 22 824 CpG–SNP pairs (Supplementary Material, Table 2) whose pleiotropic association could drive the variation at expression level locally.\n\nWe then considered the overlap between the three different studies (G2T∩G2M∩M2T) since it has been suggested that such an approach could provide information not only on the most relevant variation associated with complex traits but also on the putative mechanisms involved. As a result, we identified 10 SNP–gene pairs (Supplementary Material, Table 1.3), namely four different CpG sites mediating the association between rs3748816 on chromosome 1 and the metalloendopeptidase MMEL1 and six CpGs related to rs5754217 on chromosome 22 and the ubiquitin ligase UBE2L3. In particular, three out of the six later CpG sites were located close to the UBE2L3 promoter, while the rest spread across the 5′UTR of the gene (Fig. 2).\n\nThe rs5754217–UBE2L3 pleiotropic association and therefore the putative mediation of UBE2L3 expression levels between the SNP and CeD was further confirmed in the GTEx blood eQTL database (Supplementary Material, Table 3.1) and in the eQTL-Gen database (Supplementary Material, Table 3.2), with a P = 4.09e-05 and a P = 7.68e-07, respectively. Additionally, when the M2T analysis was rerun with each of these two eQTL databases, the G2T∩G2M∩M2T overlap revealed that the rs5754217–UBE2L3–CeD association was again apparently mediated by the methylation of adjacent CpGs. Interestingly, although other SNP–gene pairs were identified in the replication, UBE2L3 was the only hit resulting from the G2T∩G2M∩M2T analysis common to all three data sets studied (Supplementary Material, Table 3). In contrast, the G2T analysis performed in the small intestine eQTLs of the GTEx database did not reveal significant results, suggesting the cell type-specificity of our finding.\n\nRegarding the expression analysis, two different probes interrogate UBE2L3 expression in the celiac peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) microarray. One is on an exon common to all isoforms (ILMN_1677877, here denoted as UBE2L3.1) and the other is exclusive of an alternative, non-coding transcript (ILMN_1796830 or UBE2L3.2) (Figure 2). Both probes showed a dramatic, albeit opposite alteration of UBE2L3 expression in CeD (P < 1e-4) (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the minor allele of the rs5754217 SNP is the risk allele in CeD and is positively correlated with expression, a result that is consistent with the upregulation of the coding forms of UBE2L3. However, the expression of the coding isoforms shows strong negative correlation with the expression levels of the",

However, the expression of the coding isoforms shows strong negative correlation with the expression levels of the non-coding isoform 2, here represented as UBE2L3.2 (Fig. 3B).\n\nAdditionally, the relative expression score of UBE2L3 was able to perfectly distinguish GFD–CeD patients from controls, at a relative expression threshold of 1.09 (Fig. 3C). This resulted in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 1 and therefore 100% specificity and sensitivity in the discrimination capacity of CeD patients in GFD, while each UBE2L3 exons independently showed less prediction potential (AUC of 0.997 and 0.997, respectively) (Fig. 4). Interestingly, none of the probes available to report the UBE2L3 expression in the Affymetrix array of the CD and UC samples was able to distinguish patients from controls, showing AUC values ranging between 0.528–0.699 and 0.452–0.752, respectively (Fig. 4).\n\nFinally, we interrogated the rest of the candidate genes resulting from the G2T∩G2M∩M2T approaches conducted separately in each of the discovery and replication eQTL data sets in the celiac PBMC expression study (Supplementary Material, File 1). In summary, CD247 and MMEL1 did not show any differential expression when PBMCs from CeD patients on GFD and from controls were compared.

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nFigure 1 shows the study flow chart of 59 patients enrolled between August 2008 and May 2010 and randomly allocated to secukinumab (n=39) or placebo (20); 18 terminated study participation early and three discontinued study drug before the second infusion. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups (table 1) with the exception of prior ATT and bowel surgery. Disease location was reported for 55/59 patients, whereby five patients had colonic involvement and 10 patients isolated ileal disease. The trial was stopped prematurely after a planned IA of 41 patients because the prespecified criterion for futility was met. A further 18 patients were enrolled before completion of the IA, and hence the final analysis was based on data from 59 patients. All patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.\n\nPrimary end point analysis at week 6 using Bayesian analysis concluded that the probability of secukinumab being superior to placebo was 4.4% (table 2).\n\nThe difference in mean CDAI change from baseline between secukinumab and placebo was 33.9 points (SD 19.7, 95% credible interval −4.9 to 72.9), as reduction in the CDAI in the placebo group (−63.1 points) was greater than in the secukinumab group (−29.2 points, figure 2).\n\nNone of the comparisons at secondary time points demonstrated significant differences (supplementary file 2), but AUC analysis between weeks 4 and 10 showed a statistically significant difference of mean CDAI change between secukinumab and placebo in favour of placebo (p=0.043, figure 2).\n\nTo explore the apparent adverse effect of secukinumab on Crohn’s disease activity, post hoc analysis compared response to secukinumab or placebo in patients with and without objective evidence of inflammation defined by CRP or FCP. A strong trend in favour of placebo-treated patients was seen for comparisons of secukinumab and placebo within the inflammatory subgroup (n=33; mean ΔCDAI =62 (95% CI −1 to 125, p =0.054, figure 3A) but not within the non-inflammatory subgroup (n=26; p=0.87, figure 3B), indicating that the unfavourable response on secukinumab in the entire cohort was overall driven by patients with inflammatory Crohn’s disease.\n\nExploratory analysis of 35 Crohn’s disease candidate genetic polymorphisms (supplementary file 3) was performed in a subgroup of 24 patients (16 secukinumab, eight placebo). A polymorphism (rs4263839) in an intron of the tumour necrosis factor-like ligand 1A (TL1A) gene demonstrated a highly significant association with FCP response among secukinumab-treated patients (p=0.00035 in permutation test after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; figure 3, panel C), but not in placebo-treated patients (p=0.87). Absence of the minor allele was associated with worsening (ie, increase in FCP concentrations).\n\nTable 3 summarises safety data up to week 18 (end of study). More patients experienced any adverse event in the secukinumab than in the placebo groups: 29/39 (74%) and 10/20 (50%) patients, respectively, especially for infections: Twenty infections were seen in 17/39 (44%) patients on secukinumab, including four local fungal infections in four patients, versus none on placebo. Severe adverse event were reported in 11/39 (28%) in the secukinumab and 2/20 (10%) in the placebo groups. Fourteen serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 10 patients; 7/10 were reported as drug-related, six in the secukinumab and one in the placebo groups. Of the seven SAEs suspected to be drug related, five were cases of worsening of Crohn’s disease, four on secukinumab and one on placebo. Two additional SAEs (pilonidal cyst, ileostomy) were observed on secukinumab; these SAEs occurred 24 days and 7 days respectively after discontinuation from study, and therefore were not reported in the clinical database (not shown in table 3).\n\nBoth SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to worsening of underlying Crohn’s disease. Infections that were suspected by the investigator to be drug related included one case each of candidiasis, fungal infection and aphthous stomatitis. Few laboratory abnormalities were noted on secukinumab, apart from neutropenia in 4/39, compared with 1/20 on placebo, without associated infection. One patient each on secukinumab and placebo had mild abnormalities in a single liver function test.\n\nWhat are the new findings?\n\nBlockade of interleukin-17A was ineffective and higher rates of adverse events were noted compared with placebo in this proof-of-concept study.\n\nIn an exploratory substudy, lack of response as measured by faecal calprotectin was associated with a polymorphism in the tumour necrosis factor-like ligand gene.",

    "content": "Results\n\nGenetic correlation\n\nWe identified a significant positive genetic correlation between ALS and CeD, MS, RA, and SLE, as well as a significant negative genetic correlation between ALS and IBD, UC, and CD (Additional file 1: Table S2). To serve as comparison, we also explored the correlation between Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and autoimmune diseases using GNOVA with the same pipeline. As a result, significant correlation was only identified between PD and RA after the Bonferroni correction (Additional file 1: Table S2). These results suggested the considerable genetic links between ALS and autoimmune disorders. Furthermore, we searched for genomic regions that disproportionately contributed to the genetic correlation. No regions with significant correlation were identified after Bonferroni correction, while regions with nominally significant correlation were found between ALS and MS, IBD, SLE, CD, UC, and RA (Additional file 1: Figure S1).\n\nEstimation of pleiotropic enrichment\n\nIn the stratified quantile-quantile plots for ALS conditional on association P values with each autoimmune disease, successive enrichment was found for CeD and MS, and moderate enrichment was found for UC and T1D (Fig. 1), indicating that the proportion of non-null SNPs in ALS increased with higher levels of association with these diseases. In contrast, minimal or no enrichment was found for the other diseases. In the fold-enrichment plots, we could observe over 300-fold enrichment conditional on CeD, approximately 22-fold enrichment on MS, 9-fold enrichment on UC, and 5-fold enrichment on T1D for progressively stringent P value thresholds, while minimal enrichment on the other diseases, suggesting a selective genetic overlap between ALS and autoimmune disorders (Fig. 2). \n\nALS-associated loci identified with conditional FDR\n\nTo discover genetic variants associated with ALS conditional on each autoimmune disease, we performed the conditional FDR statistical analysis. A total of 32 risk loci were identified with conditional FDR < 0.01 (Additional file 1: Table S3, Fig. S2), including 23 novel loci which were not significant (P < 5.0E−08) in the original ALS GWAS. Among these 32 loci, 11 were suggestively significant (P < 1.0E−05) in the replication GWAS, namely rs3828599 (GPX3), rs10463311 (TNIP1), rs17070492 (LOC101927815), rs9969832 (MOB3B), rs2484319 (C9orf72), rs12308116 (C12orf56), rs447614 (G2E3), rs1950882 (SCFD1), rs35714695 (SARM1), rs2285642 (GGNBP2), and rs12608932 (UNC13A) (Additional file 1: Table S3). Among these replicated genes, GPX3, TNIP1, MOB3B, C9orf72, SCFD1, SARM1, and UNC13A have been described as risk genes for ALS by earlier GWAS, while the others were novel risk genes, including C12orf56, G2E3, TRIP11, and GGNBP2.\n\nRisk loci shared between ALS and autoimmune diseases\n\nTo identify shared loci between ALS and autoimmune diseases, we further calculated the conjunctional FDR statistics. A total of 13 shared risk loci were identified with conjunctional FDR < 0.05 (Table 1, Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Figure S3). Among the 13 loci, 5 were suggestively significant (P < 1.0E−05) in the replication ALS GWAS, namely rs3828599 (GPX3), rs3849943 (C9orf72), rs7154847 (G2E3), rs6571361 (SCFD1), and rs9903355 (GGNBP2). Among the 5 genes, G2E3 and GGNBP2 were newly discovered risk genes for ALS (Table 1). No shared genetic loci were found between ALS and asthma, psoriasis, RA, and SLE, which was consistent with the stratified QQ plots and fold-enrichment plots with no apparent enrichment observed. \n\nFunctional interpretation of shared risk loci\n\nTo determine the functional effects of these shared risk loci, we evaluated cis-eQTL in Braineac and GTEx. As a result, the pleiotropic risk loci affect the expression of GGNBP2, ATXN3, and SLC9A8 in tissues from both Braineac and GTEx. In addition, the pleiotropic risk loci affect the expression of DCTN4 and TEK in brain regions from Braineac (Table 2), and TRIP11, NOD2, SCFD1, C9orf72, DENND6B, PLXNB2, PPP6R2, DHRS11, MYO19, ZNHIT3, and TMEM116 in tissues from GTEx (Additional file 1: Table S4). \n\nTo determine the biological pathways represented by shared risk genes and the genes identified with cis-eQTL analyses, we conducted pathway over-representation analysis. Four pathways were enriched, namely ER to Golgi anterograde transport (P = 5.70E−03), membrane trafficking (P = 1.02E−03), transport to the Golgi and subsequent modification (P = 8.47E−03), and vesicle-mediated transport (P = 1.29E−03).

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nClinical Presentation and Family History\n\nThe proband, Patient 1, was a dichorionic/diamniotic twin of Hispanic (Salvadorean) ancestry born without complication at 35 wk gestation; the pregnancy was otherwise unremarkable. Consanguinity was denied; family history was notable for three maternal relatives with cleft lip and palate, one first cousin and two second cousins (Supplemental Fig. S1). The patient's twin was noted to have failed her newborn hearing screen in one ear, but was otherwise healthy, and remains healthy as of 3 yr and 4 mo of age. Patient 1's medical history included infantile-onset (within the first 2 wk of life) intractable diarrhea of overall unknown cause despite an extensive workup (see details below). Physical examination by a dysmorphologist/geneticist documented a thin-appearing child with no dysmorphic features noted. Pertinent negatives included no intraocular anomalies, hepatosplenomegaly, dermatologic anomalies, signs of lipodystrophy, nor focal neurologic deficits.\n\nStool electrolytes, initially tested at ∼4.5 mo of age, showed sodium of 98 mmoL/l, potassium of 17 mmoL/l, and chloride of 61 mmoL/l. Fecal osmotic gap was calculated as 60 mOsm/kg. Repeat fecal electrolytes at ∼13 mo of age showed sodium of 100 mmoL/l, potassium of 11 mmoL/l, and chloride of 79 mmoL/l. Fecal osmotic gap was calculated as 68 mOsm/kg. Plasma electrolytes were unremarkable throughout the course of disease other than as explained by dehydration. Vitamin A level was normal; vitamin K level was elevated at 4565 pg/ml (normal 80–1160 pg/ml). Additional negative/unrevealing clinical testing during the first year of life included acylcarnitine profile, urine organic acids (initial testing showed elevated methylmalonic and malonic acid, but neither was seen again with extensive follow-up testing), urine amino acids, plasma amino acids, ammonia, lactate, pancreatic elastase, skeletal survey, total complement, neutrophil oxidative burst, and sweat chloride. Upper endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy was performed twice, at 1 mo and 4 mo of age. Biopsies showed mild villous blunting of the duodenum on both endoscopies, with chronic active duodenitis, and intraepithelial lymphocytosis seen on the first occasion (Fig. 1A). Biopsies of the esophagus, stomach, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon were essentially normal. Electron microscopy of biopsy specimens was unrevealing, without definitive evidence of tufting enteropathy or microvillus inclusion disease. Testing for infectious etiologies, including stool cultures for Clostridium difficile toxin, rotavirus antigen, stool ova and parasites, blood and urine culture, and urine CMV culture, did not identify an infectious explanation for the child's condition. Stool spot testing showed grossly abnormal fecal fat, although a 72 h fecal fat (on less than half enteral feeds at one time) had an 86% coefficient reabsorption (intake 55.14 g, output 8 g in 72 h). Fecal pancreatic elastase was normal and stool tests for calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, reducing substances, and occult blood were negative.\n\nEchocardiogram performed at ∼2 wk of age related to auscultation of a murmur during her initial admission for vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy showed a small secundum-type atrial septal defect versus patent foramen ovale and mild peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Repeat echocardiogram at ∼2.5 mo of age showed no significant change from the previous echocardiogram. A follow-up echocardiogram was next performed at 4 mo of age during an admission for fever and a malfunctioning central line; this echocardiogram showed decreased systolic function by m-mode (ejection fraction [EF] = 48%) and Simpson (EF = 40%).\n\nDuring a subsequent hospitalization, additional negative/unrevealing testing included transferrin isoelectric focusing, thymidine and deoxyuridine concentrations, genetic sequencing for methylmalonic acidemia–related disorders, chromosomal microarray, genetic sequencing for Schwachman–Diamond syndrome, and a comprehensive mitochondrial next-generation sequencing panel. A cardiomyopathy next-generation sequencing panel of 198 genes (Children's National Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Washington, DC), which was performed as part of the clinical care of the patient, identified heterozygous variants of unknown significance (VUSs) in four genes, DMD (NM_004006.2 c.4233+2C>T), GYS1 (NM_002103.4 c.1324C>G p.P442A), PDSS2 (NM_020381.3 c.535A>G p.K179E), and SCN5A (NM_001099404.1 c.5103G>T p.M1701I), all of which were considered by clinical geneticists to have insufficient evidence for pathogenicity.\n\nThe patient's clinical picture changed at ∼12 mo of age. She progressed from having intractable diarrhea to severe intestinal dysmotility and intestinal pseudo-obstruction, necessitating the need for ileostomy and gastrojejunal tube placement for enteral feeding; however, she remained largely dependent on parenteral nutrition. At this stage, she developed dilated cardiomyopathy with severely decreased ventricular function (m-mode EF 40.7%), and also had multiple fevers of unknown origin that were ascribed to episodes of culture negative endocarditis",

She progressed from having intractable diarrhea to severe intestinal dysmotility and intestinal pseudo-obstruction, necessitating the need for ileostomy and gastrojejunal tube placement for enteral feeding; however, she remained largely dependent on parenteral nutrition. At this stage, she developed dilated cardiomyopathy with severely decreased ventricular function (m-mode EF 40.7%), and also had multiple fevers of unknown origin that were ascribed to episodes of culture negative endocarditis. She suffered two cardiac arrests, from which she was resuscitated, but developed subsequent anoxic brain injury. Her cardiac function continued to decrease; by 14 mo of age her m-mode EF was 23.9%, and at 18 mo was 39.9%. At 19 mo of age she had a third cardiac arrest, which was the ultimate cause of her death.\n\nPatient 2, the female second cousin of Patient 1 (the fathers of the two patients are first cousins; Supplemental Fig. S1), presented at 2 wk of life with vomiting and metabolic acidosis, which was corrected with hydration. At this time, she started to develop worsening diarrhea accompanied by emesis and was rehospitalized. During this rehospitalization, she was found to have metabolic acidosis and group B streptococcal bacteremia and was found via echocardiogram to have marked decreased cardiac contractility. Enteral feeds were unable to be advanced because of diarrhea and acidosis, and she remained dependent on parenteral nutrition. She was transferred for evaluation for small bowel transplant. Her cardiac contractility improved during hospitalization but systolic function remained mildly reduced (m-mode EF 34%–51%, SF 24%). At the time of this writing, Patient 2 was 7 mo of age and taking small amounts of oral feeds in combination with total parenteral nutrition. Diarrhea is still present but mild. Her cardiomyopathy has resolved, and to date she has not had clinical cardiomyopathy gene panel testing.\n\nGenomic Analyses\n\nBecause extensive clinical testing did not result in an explanation for Patient 1's condition, she was enrolled in Inova Translational Medicine Institute's (ITMI's) IRB-approved research study entitled “The Incidence and Burden of Congenital Anomalies, Genetic Disorders and Genetic Suspicion in Neonatal and Pediatric Patients.” Whole-genome sequencing was performed at 40× coverage (Supplemental Table S1) on peripheral blood samples from Patient 1 and both parents. Research samples from the unaffected fraternal twin and other family members, including Patient 2, were unavailable.\n\nThe 4,979,845 quality-filtered small variants and 5094 copy number variable segments in the trio were prioritized by allele frequency, inheritance pattern, associated phenotype, and proneness of genomic regions to sequencing artifacts using SAVANNA (Supplemental Fig. S2), resulting in candidate variants in nine genes (Table 1). Candidate de novo variants were identified in NEDD4L and GSK3A, homozygous variants in C14orf28 and EPCAM, potential compound heterozygous variants in DMRT1, MTCL1, and NEDD4L, and heterozygous variants possibly associated with dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance in SCN5A and DTNA. Candidate variants that had also been detected by the clinical cardiomyopathy gene panel were considered validated (Table 1). Sanger sequencing was performed on four candidate variants not identified by the clinical tests, in the genes EPCAM, NEDD4L (two variants), and GSK3A, all of which validated. Phasing of the de novo mutation in NEDD4L showed it to be in cis with the inherited NEDD4L variant on the paternal allele (Supplemental Methods, Supplemental Figs. S3, S4).\n\nThe EPCAM intronic variant c.556-14A>G was previously reported in patients with CTE and shown to alter splicing of the transcript. This homozygous variant, present in a heterozygous state in both parents, is considered causative for Patient 1's intractable diarrhea despite lack of clinical evidence of the hallmark intestinal morphology associated with this disorder. Evidence for this causation involves the familial studies, as subsequent testing of Patient 2 (described below) revealed homozygosity for the same variant, as well as intestinal tufting and absence of EPCAM cell surface expression (testing performed as part of clinical care). Retrospective testing of biopsies from Patient 1, undertaken after biopsy diagnosis was established for Patient 2, showed loss of staining for EPCAM protein (by MOC-31) (Fig. 1B). However, the EPCAM variant is not considered clearly explanatory for Patient 1's dilated cardiomyopathy or Patient 2's milder cardiac dysfunction, because, to our knowledge, cardiomyopathy has not been reported in patients with EPCAM-based CTE.\n\nAnalyses of EPCAM in Patient 2\n\nBecause of the relatedness of the two patients and the shared phenotype of intractable diarrhea, we tested Patient 2 for the EPCAM mutation identified in Patient 1. Targeted genetic testing via Sanger sequencing of the mutation of interest (GeneDx) revealed homozygosity for the tested mutation, EPCAM c.556-14A>G. Upper endoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy were grossly normal. However, duodenal biopsies were consistent with tufting enteropathy with villous atrophy and mild crypt hyperplasia, irregularity of the surface epithelium, including focal mild tufting, and complete absence of staining for EPCAM protein (by MOC31 and Ber-EP4 stains) (Fig. 1C,D).",

    "content": "Results\n\nInverse genetic correlation and genetic overlap between breast cancer and celiac disease\n\nGenetic correlation is indicative of shared genetic etiology. It refers to common genetic variation associated with a pair of phenotypic traits, assuming an additive model. Given the epidemiological association between breast cancer and celiac disease, as well as their strong genetic heritabilities, we used GWAS summary statistics for each disease to estimate genetic correlation. For breast cancer, data was obtained from the Collaborative Oncological Gene-Environment Study (COGS) consortia (http://www.cogseu.org/). The study includes individuals of European ancestry genotyped on a custom Illumina iSelect Array (iCOGS), which comprises 211,155 SNPs. iCOGS was designed to understand genetic susceptibility of three hormone related cancers: breast, ovarian, and prostate. As breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, we also included two major subtypes of breast cancer based on estrogen receptor (ER) status. In the COGS, analyses had been conducted on 46,785 breast cancer cases and 42,892 controls to estimate breast cancer risk overall, 27,078 ER-positive cases and 42,111 controls for ER-positive breast cancer risk, and 7,333 ER-negative cases and 42,468 controls for ER-negative breast cancer risk. Summary statistics for celiac disease (133,352 SNPs) were downloaded from the ImmunoBase (https://www.immunobase.org/), a web based resource focused on the genetics and genomics of immunologically related human diseases. Celiac disease data have been reported in a GWAS study by Trynka et al. on 12,041 celiac disease cases and 12,228 controls of European ancestry using the Illumina Infinitum High-Density array (ImmunoChip), interrogating 195,806 SNPs and designed to target immune associated genome regions. To improve the comparability between the two datasets, we used summary statistics for 173,301 SNPs in the iCOGS study imputed against the 1000 Genomes Project (1KG) March 2012 release reference panel, which were also present on the ImmunoChip. The datasets were matched based on chromosome and SNP base pair positions, which resulted in 129,618 celiac disease SNPs used as input.\n\nGenetic correlation between breast cancer and celiac disease was analyzed using LD score regression (LDSC) to model effect size estimates for immunogenic SNPs in both diseases. Therefore, rather than studying cross-correlation, we are studying the role of celiac disease risk loci in breast cancer susceptibility. Given the observed reduced risk of breast cancer in celiac disease patients, we would expect an inverse genetic correlation. After LDSC filtering procedure and merge with reference LD scores (Supplementary Table 1), genetic correlation analyses included 45,451, 45,451 and 45,447 matching SNPs between the celiac disease and breast cancer overall, ER-positive and ER-negative datasets, respectively. Significant inverse genetic correlations (r) were found between celiac disease and overall breast cancer (r = −0.17, s.e. 0.05, P = 0.0005) and ER-positive breast cancer (r = −0.15, s.e. 0.06, P = 0.01), but not for ER-negative breast cancer (r = −0.03, s.e. 0.07, P = 0.71) (Fig. 1). \n\nFurther interrogation of shared common genetic components between the two diseases was carried out using SNP effect concordant analysis (SECA), where SNP effect size estimates were tested for concordant or discordant effects, analogous to genetic correlation tested with LDSC. Additionally, SECA also assesses the extent of genetic overlap (enrichment of overlapping SNPs between the two traits with low P-values). For each dataset pair comparison, SECA aligned and selected 15,365, 15,400, 15,428 independent SNPs that are common between the celiac disease and overall, ER-positive, and ER-negative breast cancer datasets, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). In the primary analyses which are summarized in Supplementary Figure 1, genetic overlap (defined as excess of celiac disease SNPs in overlap with breast cancer datasets) was significant between celiac disease and breast cancer overall (P BT-permuted = <0.001), ER-positive (P BT-permuted < 0.001), and ER-negative (P BT-permuted < 0.001). SNP effect discordance (inverse correlation) between celiac disease and breast cancer overall (P FT-permuted = 0.059), ER-positive (P FT-permuted = 1.000), and ER-negative (P FT-permuted = 0.278) did not reach significance. In order to determine size of the association, SECA identified a subset of overlapping SNPs yielding the most significant correlation, namely, minimum concordance or discordance. This analysis was carried out studying the association between celiac disease and breast cancer overall (ORFT-min, 0.60, 95% CI 0.44–0.82, P FT-min = 0.001), ER-positive (ORFT-min, OR, 0.86, 95%CI, 0.74–1.00 P FT-min = 0.05), and ER-negative (ORFT-min, OR, 0.73, 95%CI, 0.57–0.95 P FT-min = 0.02) (Table 1). After adjusting for multiple testing, only the association for overall breast cancer (which",

After adjusting for multiple testing, only the association for overall breast cancer (which showed discordance) remained significant (P FTmin-permuted = 0.022). \n\nHigher celiac disease genetic susceptibility associated with decreased breast cancer risk\n\nIn a third approach, we tested whether top SNPs for celiac disease (CD-SNPs) could predict breast cancer status in a group of women. Genetic susceptibility to celiac disease was summarized using polygenic risk scores (celiac-PRS). In essence, celiac-PRS accounts for the genetic susceptibility of an individual based on the risk allele load weighted by the SNP effect sizes reported by the celiac disease GWAS, under an additive model. Celiac-PRS was analyzed as an exposure variable in a case-control study comprised of 5,002 breast cancer cases and 5,433 controls from the pKARMA cohort. Celiac-PRS was found to be inversely associated with overall and ER-positive breast cancer risk in a dose-dependent manner (P-trend < 0.02) (Table 2). Celiac-PRS based on 199 genome-wide significant CD-SNPs was associated with 6% lower risk of overall (ORper-SD, 0.94, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98, P = 0.002) and ER-positive breast cancer (ORper-SD, 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98, P = 0.004), and 2% for ER-negative breast cancer (ORper-SD, 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.06, P = 0.54). The risk was 13% lower in individuals with the highest genetic susceptibility to celiac disease (4th celiac-PRS quartile compared to 1st quartile) for both overall and ER-positive breast cancer risk (overall: ORQ4, 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97, P = 0.016; ER-positive: ORQ4, 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98, P = 0.022). The risk was up to 17% lower in women with highest susceptibility when the celiac-PRS included 3,803 SNPs nominally associated with celiac disease (i.e. P CD < 0.05) (overall: ORQ4, 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.93, P = 0.001; ER-positive: ORQ4, 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.002). As expected under a polygenic model, including more CD-SNPs in the profiles improved the strength of the association with breast cancer risk (yielding smaller P-values) (Fig. 2). In a case-only study, no significant difference was observed within tumor subgroups defined by ER-status, lymph node involvement status, HER2 status, tumor grade, and tumor size (Supplementary Table 3).  \n\nCandidate immune response genes and pathways underlying the association between celiac disease and breast cancer\n\nTo identify celiac disease genes and molecular pathways involved in breast cancer susceptibility, we performed enrichment analysis using Data-driven Expression Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits (DEPICT). The method assumes that the selected loci surpass the genome-wide significant threshold (P < 5.00E-08). However, since genome-wide significant variants did not determine the genetic overlap between breast cancer and celiac disease, we changed the threshold to include variants with moderate signals. From the 15,365 independent SNPs defined in the SECA analysis, we selected SNPs which had suggestive association with celiac disease (118 SNPs under P CD < 1.00E-05). Given that the genetic overlap was limited to immune-related genomic regions genotyped for celiac disease, we ranked overlapping SNPs by their evidence of association (by P-values) relative to the overlap with breast cancer to reduce the possibility that the prioritized genes could be due to chance (sensitivity analysis). SNPs were divided into two SNP subsets, P BC ≤ 0.05 and P BC > 0.05, containing 52 and 66 SNPs respectively. If the loci were truly important for the genetic association between celiac disease and breast cancer, findings based on second SNP subset would be less reliable. Hits derived from SNPs not nominally associated with breast cancer were therefore removed from the initial findings. The SNPs with smallest breast cancer P-value (P BC < 0.0001) were rs114762590 and rs115258774, both of which were significantly associated with celiac disease surpassing the genome-wide significant threshold and had opposite direction to breast cancer. Summary statistics for the top 52 SNPs are shown in Supplementary Table 4.\n\nGenes mapping onto the 52 ‘top’ overlapping SNPs were significantly overrepresented in 21 biological processes (FDR < 0.05). After the sensitivity analysis (yielding 600 significant processes at FDR < 0.01), 14 processes remained as unique hits and were mainly related to induction of programmed cell death, MAP3K",

To identify genes most likely underlying these biological processes, DEPICT identified 15 prioritized genes that were deemed most relevant based on their probability to enrich for the same biological processes as other candidate genes (i.e. redundant genes were removed, FDR < 0.05) (Table 3).

The p.Arg114Trp variant (rs200554980), located in the N-terminal proline-rich repressor domain, is rare based on population data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/variant/X-49113998-G-A). The Arg114Trp variant in the proband was maternally inherited. The subject’s maternal grandfather was diagnosed with diabetes at 67 years of age with no clinical information on therapy or DNA sample available for testing. The p.Arg347His variant, located in the forkhead box domain, has been previously described in patients with IPEX syndrome. This likely pathogenic sequence change was present in the de novo state in the proband. The p.Lys393Met variant, also located in the forkhead box domain, has not been identified in the general population (ExAC). This variant is predicted to be possibly damaging (Polyphen HumDiv score: 0.63) and it is situated between two previously reported FOXP3 pathogenic variants: p.Ser390Asn and p.Arg397Trp. DNA from the proband’s mother was not available to determine inheritance. The c.1044+5G>A splice site change is adjacent to a previously reported variant c.1044+4A>G identified in one case with classic IPEX. We studied all available family members and identified the c.1044+5G>A variant in the unaffected mother (UC0078B) and the proband’s brother (UC0078D) who was diagnosed with diabetes at 2.1 years of age (Figure 1), as well as in one other proband who was diagnosed at 8 months. Flow cytometric analysis for UC0078A showed that FOXP3 protein was expressed by 97% of CD4+CD25+ T cells in peripheral blood (reference range: 87–100) with an absolute FOXP3+ cell count of 77 cells/mcL (reference range: 29–303).\n\nWe then examined the effect of the c.1044+5G>A variant on mRNA splicing. RT-PCR and sequencing demonstrated abnormal splicing that generated both a wild-type and truncated transcript missing exon 10 (Figure 1). The mother’s lymphocytes also showed a lower abundance of the exon 10-minus transcript (14.6 %) compared to those of her sons (32 %).",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nComparison of baseline characteristics showed that more controls had low birth weight compared with cases (P < 0.05) and cases had diarrhea more frequently (five to nine episodes) than controls (one to three episodes; P < 0.001) (Supplemental Table 2). Hence, the multivariate logistic regression analysis performed to determine the association of SNP was adjusted for birth weight and the number of diarrheal episodes. Among the MBL2 exon1 polymorphisms, the variant allele B at codon 54 (rs1800450) was found to be associated with susceptibility to cryptosporidial diarrhea (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1–4.5) (Table 1) in the multivariate analysis, whereas variant allele C at codon 57 (rs1800451) did not show any association (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.1–1.6). Among MBL2 haplotypes with a frequency > 2%, the HXBA haplotype was found to be associated with risk of cryptosporidial diarrhea (OR = 6.5, 95% CI: 1.0–41.3) (Table 2). However, when adjusted for multiple comparisons (p-adj), the MBL2 rs1800450 polymorphism and HXBA haplotype association with cryptosporidial diarrhea was not significant. Plasma MBL levels ranged from 63.6 to 3823.2 ng/mL. The median age of children at which the MBL levels were measured was 5.91 years (range 5.3–6.7 years). Cases had significantly lower MBL levels (median 575.6 ng/mL, interquartile range [IQR] 420.3–883.2 ng/mL) than controls (median 1090.9 ng/mL, IQR 770–1824.7 ng/mL; P < 0.001) (Figure 1A). When plasma MBL levels among the controls for each promoter diplotype were compared, the LY/LX diplotype had markedly lower levels (P = 0.018) and was chosen to represent the “deficient” diplotype in this population. Receiver operating characteristic curve generated with plasma MBL levels in the “deficient” controls with the LY/LX diplotype showed that a cutoff of 873.5 ng/mL would be optimal (sensitivity 81%, specificity 77%, area under the curve = 0.83) (Figure 1B). When this cutoff was then reapplied to the diplotype distribution, all children (cases and controls) with the LY/LX genotype were classified as “deficient,” thereby validating the cutoff (Figure 1C). Using this cutoff, when the proportion of children with MBL deficiency among cases and controls was compared, more than twice the number of cases (72%) than controls (32%) were found to be deficient (OR = 5.09) (Figure 1C).\n\nWhen TLR polymorphisms were examined, the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the TLR1 SNP rs5743618 was similar in cases and controls (Table 1), and all subjects enrolled in this study had the ancestral allele at the TLR2 SNP rs5743708 locus, consequently neither of these SNPs was analyzed further. The TLR4 SNP rs4986790 heterozygous genotype 896A/G and the TIRAP SNP rs8177374 heterozygous 539C/T genotypes were seen more often among controls than cases. Both SNP were associated with protection from cryptosporidial diarrhea in the multivariate analysis (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.11–0.98, and OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.06–0.64, respectively) (Table 1) but only the TIRAP SNP approached significance (p-adj = 0.08). None of the other polymorphisms showed any significant association with cryptosporidial diarrhea. When haplotype analysis was carried out, no significant association for either TLR4 or TLR9 haplotypes was seen with the risk of cryptosporidial diarrhea (Table 2).",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nGWAS\n\nNine separate GWAS (three ancestral groups by three studies) were conducted using PLINK v1.90 with linear regression of the quantitative factor score regressed against imputed SNP dosage for approximately ten million common SNPs after applying post-imputation QC, with sex, age and the first 10 within-ancestry principal components included as covariates. The genomic inflation factor λ ranged from 0.996 to 1.01 for all analyses suggesting little effect of population stratification consistent with q-q plots (Supplemental Figure S2). GWAS conducted within each study by ancestry group, across studies by ancestry group, and across all groups produced no genome-wide significant associations with the factor score. One exception is the EUR PPDS group for which a cluster of SNPs on chromosome 2 in the MYO1H gene had association p-values around 1E10−9; this association did not replicate in the other groups nor survive meta-analysis. The Manhattan plot for the STARRS trans-ethnic meta-analysis conducted in METAL is presented in Figure 1 (N=16,510). Loci containing SNPs with suggestive association (p<1×10−6) are listed in Supplementary Table S5.\n\nThe findings from MR-MEGA that included data from EUR, AFR, and LAT participants essentially mirror those from the METAL meta-analysis. That is, we obtained only trend-level association signals that do not reach genome-wide significance. Supplementary Table S6 lists the magnitude and direction of SNP associations across the three ancestry groups estimated for SNPS in regions with trend-level associations using MR-MEGA. The SNPs display little evidence of heterogeneity across ethnicities with signs that are predominantly concordant, and formal tests of heterogeneity were non-significant. Bolded locations are the same SNPs that METAL identified. The p-value for the overall sign test across all these loci was significant (p=0.024).\n\nThe prior ANGST GWAS conducted in EUR data identified an association between SNPs in the CAMKMT gene on chromosome 2 (ch2:44,589,147–44,683,729) and a similarly constructed anxiety factor score. Within this genomic region, 69 of the 387 SNPs (17.8%) were nominally significant in the STARRS EUR cohort (Supplementary File 2).\n\nMeta-analysis\n\nWe conducted two SNP-based meta-analyses with the ANGST data to examine consistency with current results. First, only EUR data from STARRS were included to minimize heterogeneity (combined N=28,963). Figure 2a depicts the Manhattan plot and 2b the QQ plot. In Figure 2a, the genomic region on chromosome 2 from the ANGST discovery GWAS (green) is the most significantly associated region in the meta-analysis. The locus zoom plot for that region is shown in Figure 2c with lead SNP rs1067394. Next, all the STARRS data were included (combined N=34,709). The results of this trans-ancestry meta-analysis resemble the EUR only meta-analysis, but most associations are less significant.\n\nTable 1 presents the beta coefficients and p-values in each sample for the two SNPs with the strongest association in each analysis (rs1067327 and rs1067394 respectively. These genomewide significant SNPs in ANGST were nominally significant in the EUR STARRS meta-analysis (bolded), providing an independent replication. Notably, for each SNP the effect sizes are remarkably similar to the ANGST results. P-values were considerably smaller in the combined of ANGST+STARRS meta-analysis, indicating increased precision. The associations are not evident in the AFR and LAT subsamples, suggesting there may be population-variable effects on ANX risk for this locus.\n\nSNP-based Heritability and Genetic Correlations\n\nWe applied LDSC to obtain a SNP-based heritability estimate of 0.073 (p=0.007) in the EUR participants. This was essentially identical to that obtained in ANGST (0.072). We also used LDSC to estimate genetic correlations between the STARRS EUR ANX association signal and selected related traits. As indicated in Table 2, the STARRS anxiety dimension is genetically correlated with other relevant internalizing phenotypes with the highest correlation appropriately for the ANGST factor score. As expected, the estimates were positive with all except extraversion and subjective well-being. As predicted by genetic epidemiological studies, genetic correlations with less related phenotypes like schizophrenia were much smaller. However, none of the estimates were statistically different from zero.\n\nGene-based and pathway analyses\n\nNo gene-based or pathway analyses yielded significant findings for any STARRS cohorts alone. However, significant results did emerge when we applied MAGMA and JEPEGMIX2 in the combined STARRS EUR+ANGST meta-analysis. MAGMA gene-level analyses (Supplementary Table S7) detected two regions harboring significant signals. The first includes CAMKMT plus two other genes (PREPL and SLC3A1) in the same LD block on chromosome 2; these were also identified in the prior ANGST gene-based analysis. The second is LBX1 on chromosome 10 encoding a homeobox transcription factor. JEPEGMIX2 also detected two highly significant transcriptomic signals, the first in thyroid tissue for pseudogene RP11–815N9.2 on chromosome 4 and the second in pituitary tissue for PREPL (Supplementary Table S8).

Radiologically, hypoplasia of the trachea was suspected in both animals. Furthermore, the male sibling appeared to have an enlarged heart. Both puppies died suddenly and were submitted for postmortem examination. Necropsy findings in both animals revealed a very pale and enlarged heart. In light microscopy, the cardiomyocytes were swollen with a perinuclear clearing while the rest of the sarcoplasm was displaced and appeared grainy compared to heart tissue from other canine puppies (Figure 1). There was a minimal chronic lymphocytic myocarditis as a result of the degeneration of affected cardiomyocytes. Few cells of the exocrine pancreas had optically empty vacuoles in the cytoplasm, and hepatocytes in both animals had a finely granular appearance. Despite attempting various histologic staining procedures, the accumulated material could not be further characterized. Further testing for canine parvovirosis was negative. The cause of disease and death were likely due to the degenerative changes in the heart, leading to myocardial failure.\n\nA third male puppy became reluctant to move while twitching and showing tremors at six weeks of age. During these bouts of tremors and twitching it exhibited spontaneous urination and defecation. The puppy was treated for myelitis and died suddenly at 8 weeks of age. The necropsy and histologic examination revealed similar changes in the heart as with the other two puppies where cardiomyocytes appeared to have a grainy sarcoplasm. Furthermore, there were mild changes in the brain and spinal cord with few chromatolytic neurons in the spinal cord, mild gliosis in the cerebellum, and a mild mixed cell infiltration of the meninges of the cerebellum. Additionally, the puppy had a catarrhal enteritis, for which the cause could not be determined. The cause of disease remained undetermined after the necropsy.\n\n3.2. Genetic Analysis\n\nThe pedigree of the three affected puppies was suggestive for a monogenic autosomal recessive mode of inheritance (Figure 2). Linkage analysis of a family with two affected and one unaffected offspring revealed 33 linked genome segments comprising 262 Mb in total. We also performed homozygosity mapping in the two affected siblings. They shared 32 homozygous regions across the genome. The intersection of the linked and homozygous intervals consisted of 13 genome segments totaling 82 Mb (Table S2).\n\nWe sequenced the genome of the affected puppy MA471 at 26.2x coverage. We called SNVs and short indels with respect to the CanFam3.1 reference genome assembly. We then compared these variants to whole genome sequence data of 8 wolves and 637 control dogs from genetically diverse breeds (Table 1).\n\nOnly three private protein-changing variants were located in the linked and homozygous regions (Table 2). We confirmed these three variants by Sanger sequencing and genotyped them in a cohort of 96 Belgian Shepherd dogs. For two of the variants we observed all three genotypes in healthy dogs, which excluded them as being causative for a lethal phenotype.\n\nThis left only one candidate causative variant, Chr27:16,157,324A>G, for which we did not find any homozygous mutant control dogs. It represented a missense variant in the third exon of the YARS2 gene encoding tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase 2, which is the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Figure 3). The variant, XM_543740.6:c.1054G>A, is predicted to change a highly conserved glutamate to a lysine, XP_543740.1:p.(Glu352Lys). In silico analysis predicted the functional effect of p.Glu352Lys as disease causing, with an 84% probability (PMut,), or to affect protein function, with a score of 0.01 (Sift,).\n\nWe genotyped additional dogs for the YARS2:c.1054G>A variant to end up with a final cohort of 474 Belgian Shepherd dogs and 534 dogs of genetically diverse other breeds. The genotypes were perfectly associated with the juvenile lethality phenotype (Table 3). All 3 deceased puppies were homozygous mutant while none of the 1000 control dogs carried the mutant allele in a homozygous state. The mutant allele was only detected in Belgian Shepherd dogs but not in any dogs from other breeds. It was most commonly seen in the Malinois variety of Belgian Shepherd dogs, but it also occurred in the Groenendael and Tervueren varieties.\n\nThe overall mutant allele frequency in the genotyped Belgian Shepherd cohort was 14.1%. The observed mutant allele frequencies in Malinois (n = 383), Groenendael (n = 36), Tervueren (n = 52), and Laekenois (n = 3) were 0.16, 0.03, 0.07, and 0, respectively.\n\nThe genotyped cohort did not represent a truly random representation of the breed as it contained ~20 close relatives to the three cases that were specifically collected for the project. Therefore, the observed carrier frequency of 27.2% in the controls of our Belgian Shepherd cohort may represent an overestimation of the true carrier frequency in the Middle European Belgian Shepherd population. The observed genotype frequencies deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with a significant underrepresentation of homozygous mutant dogs (p = 2.6 × 10−4).",

    "content": "Results\n\nStudy population\n\nBetween January 2009 and December 2011 (pre-specified period of 2 years), we recruited 322 ovarian cancer patients treated with 3–6 cycles paclitaxel-carboplatin combination therapy (n = 266) or 3–6 cycles carboplatin mono-therapy (n = 56) (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Of all recruited patients, 99% was Caucasian (Table 2). Hematological toxicity was analyzed in 290 patients, after exclusion of patients for which weekly blood examinations were not available (n = 32). For neurotoxicity, 56 patients treated with carboplatin monotherapy were excluded since the incidence of sensory neuropathy was significantly lower in this population (p < 0.001). One patient with pre-existing sensory neuropathy before start of chemotherapy was additionally excluded, bringing the total number of patients eligible up to 265. For the secondary objectives, PFI and OS, all patients treated with paclitaxel-carboplatin (n = 266) were included. Patient, disease and toxicity characteristics are summarized in Table 2. Briefly, grade 3–4 anemia was present in 57 patients (19.7%), grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia in 57 patients (19.7%), grade 4 neutropenia in 202 patients (69.7%), whereas only 23 patients (7.9%) presented with grade 3–4 febrile neutropenia. In the group of patients selected for neurotoxicity analysis, 48 patients (18.1%) developed grade 2–3 sensory and none motor neuropathy following combination treatment with paclitaxel-carboplatin. Minor allele frequencies (MAF) were similar to those reported previously in Caucasians and adhered to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Allele frequencies of all genotyped SNPs are shown in Additional file 2: Table S1.\n\nAssociation with anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and sensory neuropathy\n\nAmong the 290 patients eligible for the hematological toxicity analysis, we observed significant associations for 5 variants (Table 3). In particular, rs1128503 (ABCB1, C > T), rs12762549 (ABCC2, C > G), rs363717 (ABCA1, A > G) and rs11615 (ERCC1, T > C) were significantly associated with grade 3–4 anemia (p = 0.035, OR 1.58; p = 0.005, OR 0.55; p = 0.001, OR 1.31 and p = 0.024, OR = 1.58). After correction for relevant covariates (as explained in the statistical methods), these variants were still significantly associated with toxicity (p = 0.023, OR 1.71; p = 0.004, OR 0.51; p = 0.002, OR 2.08; and p = 0.031, OR 1.61 respectively). Another variant rs4986910 (CYP3A4, T > C) correlated with thrombocytopenia grade 3–4, before and after correction for relevant covariates (p = 0.012, OR 5.61 and p = 0.025, OR 4.99 respectively; Table 3). When correlating each of the variants with grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, we did not observe a significant association. Finally, we also correlated each of the variants to sensory neuropathy in the population that was eligible for neurotoxicity analyses, but failed to identify significant associations. None of the observed associations with hematologic toxicity survived correction for multiple testing.\n\nAssociation between genetic variants and use of growth factors\n\nThe use of ESAs or CSFs was also correlated with each of the 26 variants to examine whether they could predict the need for an ESA or CSF during treatment with chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. After correction for relevant covariates, a significant correlation for rs2074087 (ABCC1, G > C) and the use of ESA was noticed (p = 0.011, OR 2.09, Table 4). After correction for covariates, CSF use was significantly correlated with rs2073337 (ABCC2, A > G), rs1695 (GSTP1, A > G) and rs1799793 (ERCC2, G > A) (p = 0.039, OR 0.60; p = 0.017, OR 0.55; and p = 0.042, OR 0.63 respectively). None of the observed associations with use of growth factors survived correction for multiple testing.\n\nEffects of variants on PFI and OS\n\nThe median follow-up of all patients participating to the study was 2.5 years (95% CI = 2.2-2.8 years) with 157 events for progression (59%) and 84 events for OS (31.6%). Uncorrected P-values were calculated using Cox regression analysis either adjusted for age at diagnosis only or fully adjusted for age at diagnosis, FIGO stage, tumor grade, tumor histology and residual disease after debulking surgery. Only one variant, rs1799793 (ERCC2 G > A), was significantly correlated with PFI in both cases (p = 0.003, HR = 0.71, 95% CI =",

    "content": "Results\n\nInitial screen for DNA variants\n\nIndex cases from our VUR families were screened for DNA variants in the promoter and exons specific to ROBO2a by commercial Sanger sequencing (plus in-house work where necessary – see Materials and Methods) and then followed up with in-house investigations including family and control studies. (Note that though we had DNA from parents of VUR cases, it was usually not known whether either of the parents had had VUR.) Exon 1 is entirely non-coding. Authorities currently disagree on the position of the start of the exon, making it 266, 267 or 286 bp in length (see Supplementary Information) but we can say that the sequenced region covering the promoter and Exon 1 was 1,543 bp finishing 102 bp downstream of the exon. There is a very similar copy of this exon and its surrounding sequence on Chromosome 22q11.1, but the four overlapping pairs of commercial primers successfully amplified only the Chromosome 3 sequence. Nine variants were found in the upstream and first-exon amplicons in this initial screen: the first nine detailed in Table 1. Four of these variants (two found in only one index case each and two in two index cases each) were not recorded in the version of dbSNP current at the time, so the samples from the families of the index cases who bore them were investigated for segregation of the variant alleles with VUR. (They are the first four variants for which family studies are shown in the family studies columns of Table 1, i.e. the variants at c.-1386_-1384, c.-320, c.-111 and c.-78, as listed in the Position column of Table 1.) We used in-house primers, in order that we could screen by high-resolution melting-curve (HRM) analysis, because the commercial sequencing amplicons are 500–600 bp in length and the optimum amplicon length for detection of sequence variants by HRM is 150–400 bp. The first of the novel variants (c.-1386_-1384del) was in a gap in the homology with Chromosome 22 (see Supplementary Fig. S1) so it was possible to design a primer-pair specific to Chromosome 3. However, the region immediately surrounding the other three novel variants (c.-320, c.-111 and c.-78) is very similar to the Chromosome 22 sequence, so nested PCR was performed using the Chromosome-3-specific commercial primer-pair in the first round followed by internal amplification of the PCR products with HRM primers (see Materials & Methods).\n\nThese investigations showed that three of the four novel variants did not segregate with VUR - at least one family with each contained a member who had VUR but did not carry the variant (as shown in the ‘VUR – var’ column of Table 1) – and all of these variants have subsequently appeared in more recent versions of dbSNP. The other variant, at position -111 in the 5′-UTR, was found to be carried by both affected children and the father in the one family in which it occurred, Family 135. We therefore screened our 592 Irish population control samples for this variant, and it was not present, making it a potential candidate for causing VUR. Exon 2 is 122 bp in length, the first 13 bp non-coding before the translation start codon, so can be covered with generous flanking sequence by a single amplicon. However, the complication was again genomic copies, with homology extending far beyond the exon on either side. Yue et al. had warned that there were copies of Exons 1 & 2 on 20p11.1 and 22q11.1, and we had found that the Exon 1 sequence had a match on Chromosome 22, so were expecting a Chromosome 20 match for Exon 2. The results of the commercial sequencing of Exon 2 in our VUR index cases suggested that at least two different genomic copies had been amplified, as 18 variants were reported in a 535-bp amplicon, and our inspection of the chromatograms showed other positions in which there were also two different nucleotides, which had missed detection by the sequence-analysis software. We therefore submitted the Exon 2 sequence to GRCh37/hg19 build of the Human Genome by BLAT, and this indicated a single complete copy on Chromosome 20 and showed that the reverse commercial primer matched both copies perfectly, and the forward one differed from the Chromosome 20 sequence only at one position, 12 nucleotides back from the 3′ nucleotide of the primer. Many of the variants corresponded with reported SNPs, so we designed Chromosome 3- and Chromosome 20-specific primers so that we could determine which were true SNPs on Chromosome 3, which were true SNPs on Chromosome 20, and which were not SNPs at all but merely differences between the fixed sequences at the two genomic locations, in addition to identifying any novel variants. PCRs with the new primers revealed that there must be more genomic copies. The GRCh38/hg38 build of the genome showed two more copies, both thought to be on Chromosome 22. We eventually accounted for all variations in the sequences that we obtained. Full details are given in the Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table S1, but the salient point is that there was found to be only one variant in the Chromosome 3 copy, the true ROBO2a Exon 2 amplicon. It is a polymorphism, now known as rs539728114, and is not in the exon but 64",

Full details are given in the Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table S1, but the salient point is that there was found to be only one variant in the Chromosome 3 copy, the true ROBO2a Exon 2 amplicon. It is a polymorphism, now known as rs539728114, and is not in the exon but 64 bp upstream of it (this is the last variant listed in Table 1). Thus the initial screen of the two exons, their flanking regions and sequence upstream of Exon 1 had found ten variants of which one was a possible cause of VUR. However, enquiry into variant function showed that more investigations were warranted.\n\nRegulatory context of the novel variant at c.-111 and further investigations\n\nThe novel variant is in the 5′-UTR of the gene. The variant allele is an adenosine which replaces the guanosine of a CpG dinucleotide, thereby removing this CpG site. The cytosine of this CpG dinucleotide was found to be methylated on 100% of DNA molecules in 5/23 cell lines in which methylation was investigated by bisulphite sequencing in the ENCODE project, and methylated on 50% of the DNA molecules in a further two cell lines, and the genome there was found to have the histone methylation H3K4Me3 mark, often found near promoters and the H3K27Ac mark often found near active regulatory regions (all annotated on the GRCh37/hg19 build of the Human Genome in the UCSC Genome Browser). This suggested the possibility that this variant might alter the expression of ROBO2a in some cell types, though unfortunately few cells of urinary tract origin were included in the ENCODE project and none were tested for methylation.\n\nA check of the other nine variants revealed that all but the three furthest from the start of the gene either created or removed a CpG with respect to the reference allele. For each, one allele made a CpG and the other did not, and the one that made the CpG was not always the reference allele and was not always the major allele. Seven in a row (counting the novel variant) seemed to require an explanation. The last variant of these seven is over 30 kb from the rest, 64 bp upstream of Exon 2, but the first six were observed to be in a CpG island, chr3:75,955,760–75,956,308 hg19, chr3:75,906,609–75,907,157 hg38. The arrangement of the start of ROBO2a is different from that of ROBO2b (Fig. 2). ROBO2b has a CpG island which is entirely upstream of the first exon, in which coding begins after a long 5′UTR, but the CpG island at the start of ROBO2a entirely surrounds the first exon, which is all non-coding, and extends further downstream than the flanking region that we had screened.\n\nWe therefore designed a new set of Chromosome 3-specific primers (to avoid amplifying the Chromosome 22 copy) and screened the remaining 99 bp of the island by PCR and HRM analysis followed by sequencing of cases with aberrant melting curves. This uncovered a single variant, present in two index cases. It is rs182521620 and does not affect a CpG dinucleotide. (This is the penultimate variant shown in Table 1.) dbSNP has no frequency data for it, and the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) gives a minor-allele frequency of 9/15,006 in non-Finnish Europeans (i.e. 9 heterozygotes out of 7,503 individuals), giving it a frequency of 0·0005998, which is much rarer that 2/251 index cases, so first we checked the families for segregation with VUR. Unfortunately this was not very useful due to lack of DNA from many family members of these two cases. For one of the index cases we only had DNA from the mother, who had the variant, and from the other family we had DNA from both parents and the affected sibling, and the sibling and the mother also had the variant. We could thus not exclude the variant from segregation with VUR, so screened our 592 healthy control samples. Two of them were heterozygotes for the variant, so it is evidently more common in Ireland than in other non-Finnish Europeans, and not significantly different from the frequency in our Irish VUR index cases. Our screen for variants in the start of ROBO2a had thus found a total of 11 variants (Table 1) and we still had a run of six CpG variants.\n\nIn contrast, a check of our results of ROBO2b, of which we had previously screened the upstream sequence and all exons in our index cases, showed that we had also found eleven variant positions in the equivalent part of that isoform, but only two made a CpG for one allele and not for the other. They are adjacent variants but 451 bp apart and only one of them in the CpG island. The ROBO2b upstream CpG island, chr3:77,088,499–77,089,198 hg 19, is 700 bp long, and contains 67 CpGs in the Reference Sequence. However, only three of the variants in our index cases were in this island, and only the one caused the presence or absence of a CpG, while another merely moved a CpG (the alleles being CpCpG and CpGp",

However, only three of the variants in our index cases were in this island, and only the one caused the presence or absence of a CpG, while another merely moved a CpG (the alleles being CpCpG and CpGpG) and the third did not involve a CpG at all (Table 2). Genes may also have CpG islands within the gene body (defined as between 500 bp downstream of the transcription start site to the end of the last exon). Despite reportedly having many different transcripts with several different start sites, the whole human ROBO2 gene has just three CpG islands: the ones at the beginnings of the ROBO2a and ROBO2b transcripts and a gene-body island that surrounds Exon 2 of ROBO2b. The latter island, chr3:77,147,168–77,147,399, hg19, chr3:77098017–77098248, hg38, is 232 bp long and contains 20 CpG dinucleotides. We found a single variant within this, rs6788280, which was also found by other investigators of ROBO2b in VUR patients, and that disrupts a CpG dinucleotide.\n\nThe run of variant CpG sites in the ROBO2a CpG island made it likely that nearly all individuals would be heterozygous for some of them, raising the possibility that this island might never be as highly methylated as the island at the start of ROBO2b. We therefore checked the genotypes of all six variants in all 251 VUR index cases (rather than the 592 controls, because most of the index case samples had been sequenced whereas the control samples had only been screened by high-resolution melting-curve analysis for the novel variant and the last variant discovered, and there was no reason to suppose that the VUR samples would be more variable than the controls, except for the presence of the novel variant). The full set of 6 × 251 genotypes is given in Supplementary Table S2. In the diploid sequence of the six variant CpG positions, the homozygous Reference Sequence would have six CpGs and the total possible number is 12. Our 251 cases had a mean of 5·430 CpGs, standard deviation 0·736, with a range of 4–8 CpGs. The phasing is unknown, so we cannot list the haplotypes, but we can say from the diploid genotypes that there were two different diplotypes with 4 CpGs, 3 with 5 CpGs, 4 with 6 CpGs, 2 with 7 CpGs and only one with 8 CpGs at the variable positions. The total number of all CpGs in the CpG island at the start of ROBO2a is less than in that of ROBO2b, and is of course more variable, since the latter has only one presence/absence CpG variant (Fig. 3).\n\nFinally, we investigated the haplotype of the novel CpG-altering variant. We genotyped all six positions in both parents and the affected sibling of the index case with the variant, enabling us to derive the haplotypes. This revealed that both parents had diplotypes containing 5 CpGs, each having one haplotype with 3 CpGs and one with two. The haplotype with 3 CpGs was the same for both parents and was the reference sequence haplotype, while the haplotypes with two CpGs were different. Both children had diplotypes containing only 4 CpGs, having both received the haplotypes with 2 CpGs from both parents. The one from the mother had the non reference allele ‘T’ of rs35862955 at c.-365 removing one CpG from the reference haplotype. The one from the father also had the non-reference allele of rs35862955 removing one CpG, and had the novel allele at c.-111 removing another CpG, but gained a CpG from having the non-reference allele of rs13073919 at c.-67.

No significant differences were identified for age, BMI or years to menopause between patients with PMOP and controls. \n\nAll selected SNPs were in HWE in the control group (Supplemental Table S1).

As expected, the GAD symptom score (skew=0.63; kurtosis=2.48) and total trait anxiety score (skew=0.87; kurtosis=3.21) were skewed towards lower values. No transformations of the outcome were performed as linear regression is robust to minor violations of normality.\n\nDiscovery Sample: SNP Heritability\n\nAs shown in Table I, the GAD symptom score showed evidence of modest heritability (h2SNP=7.2%; p=0.03), while the total trait anxiety score did not (h2SNP=4.97%; p=0.20). Building from these results, we conducted a GWAS only on the GAD symptom score.\n\nDiscovery Sample: GWAS\n\nThe Manhattan and QQ plots are shown in Figure 1. As shown in the QQ plots, there was no evidence of inflation in either the GWAS of the full sample or the analysis that excluded medication users (λ =1.02). No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance in the full sample, which included imputed scores for medication users (Table II). However, one genotyped SNP (rs78602344), located on chromosome 6 at position 169626581, emerged from both analyses. This SNP was the second most significant result in the full sample (p=1.41×10−7) and the most significant result (p=4.18×10−8) in the analysis excluding medication users (Table III). The SNP is intronic to Thrombospondin 2 (THBS2), a gene that mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. Several other SNPs in the region also showed support for association (Figure 2).\n\nA second SNP with a low p-value in both analyses was rs17729883 (full sample p=7.29×10−7; excluding medication users p=5.09×10−7) located at chromosome 8 position 9256631. This genotyped SNP was located in an intron of an uncharacterized gene (LOC 106379231; Supplemental Figure 1).\n\nAll GWAS results at p<1×10−5 are shown in the Supplemental Materials for the GAD symptom score for the full sample (Supplemental Table I), excluding medication users (Supplemental Table II), and for the original, non-transformed score (Supplemental Table III).\n\nTo determine which SNPs to carry forward for replication, we estimated replication power for all SNPs with p-values <1×10−6 in at least one of the two analyses according to our selection criteria detailed above. Replication power estimates were based on the projected samples sizes of each replication dataset (Army STARRS=3000; WHI=3000; MESA=1500) and using MAF, outcome standard deviation, and estimated effect sizes from the discovery sample. Our power calculations incorporated a method to reduce bias due to “winner’s curse”, effectively attenuating the observed effect size. A prior study showed that attenuated effect size estimates tend to be closer than uncorrected estimates to effects seen in independent replication studies.\n\nOur power analysis suggested one SNP (rs78602344) would have excellent power in a meta analysis of the three replication cohorts after the winner’s curse bias correction (estimated power=0.96); all other SNPs had weak power (≤0.70). We therefore carried forward this single SNP for replication.\n\nReplication Samples: GWAS Results\n\nIn the replication phase, one SNP (rs78602344) was evaluated in three independent samples. This SNP was not significantly associated with the GAD symptom score in a meta analysis of the replication sites (Table IV).",

    "content": "Results\n\nExome analysis\n\nUnder the hypothesis that mutations in a single gene caused the DBA/TCS phenotype, we filtered for genes that had rare (MAF<0.005 in ESP or 1000 Genomes), likely functional (not intronic, intergenic, or UTR) variants in at least three of the five kindreds. Seven genes (IST1, PCDHA9, ADRA2B, AXDND1, LTBP2, GRIK3, and FBN3) met these criteria; however none had a convincing connection to known DBA biology. Therefore, we checked each kindred for candidate variants in ribosomal protein genes that segregated with the phenotype.\n\nFamily 1\n\nIn Family 1, we identified 27 variants that segregated with the DBA/TCS phenotype, e.g. homozygous or hemizygous in the two affected cousins and heterozygous in their obligate carrier mothers. Hence, we focused on a highly conserved(GERP 5.91) missense mutation, p.E64G in TSR2 (Table II and Supplemental Fig. 1), because its protein product is involved in processing/maturation of rRNA and binds to RPS26. Further, the gene is located on the X chromosome, consistent with phenotypic expression in the males only.\n\nFamily 2\n\nIn Family 2, we identified a highly conserved (GERP 5.06) nonsense mutation, p.R87*, in RPS26 (Table II), a gene known to be associated with DBA10. Although this mutation is present in dbSNP (rs148942765), it is not present in 1000 Genomes or the ESP6500. This mutation, which is absent from the unaffected mother, is found in the affected father and his two daughters.\n\nFamily 3\n\nAn unrelated kindred, Family 3, became available after the exome analysis was performed. Sanger sequencing in the proband identified a de novo 3′ splice site mutation in RPS26, affecting the adenine in the conserved AG dinucleotide acceptor splice site of intron 1. Indeed, RT-PCR analysis revealed that the variant affects mRNA splicing, with loss of exon 2 resulting in an aberrant gene product (Supplemental Fig. 2).\n\nFamilies 4 and 5\n\nIn Patient 5, we identified a missense variant, RPL18 p.D10E, which has been previously reported with a minor allele frequency of 0.001 in the ClinSeq population (rs143728553) and was heterozygous in her mother. When we expanded our analysis to include variant calls regardless of GATK filter flags or low coverage (DP<=6), we identified a novel mutation on chromosome 19 in the translation initiation codon of RPS28 (c.A1G) in unrelated probands from Families 4 (DP=10) and 5 (DP=2). This highly conserved variant (GERP 5.08) was not present in 1000 Genomes or the ESP6500. It was initially excluded from our analyses because it failed the allele balance, quality by depth, and strand bias filters (read depth of 10 and 2, genotype quality of 42.66 and 0.97 in the two probands). However, Sanger sequencing confirmed this de novo variant in PWBC and in buccal cell derived DNA of both patients, suggesting a germline origin for this mutation. Strikingly, Sanger sequencing revealed allelic imbalance, with loss of the mutant allele in Patient 4 PWBC DNA, but not in her buccal cell derived DNA (Supplemental Fig. 3). Though no additional SNPs were present in RPS28, by inspecting the vcf files we identified additional imbalanced heterozygous sites in FBN3 (19p13.3) and ZNF414 (19p13.2), which were validated by Sanger sequencing. The same phenomenom was observed in Patient 5, though loss of the mutant allele occurredonly in the buccal cells (Supplemental Fig. 3). Using heterozygous SNPs found in FBN3, CD320, NDUFA7, KANK3, and ZNF414, this tissue-specific allelic imbalance was confirmed to extend along 19p13.3-p13.2. RPL18, located on 19q13.33, did not show allelic imbalance, thus indicating the phenomenon may be limited to 19p.To test this hypothesis, Family 5's samples underwent SNP microarray analysis. Supplemental figure 4 shows the copy number status, as well as allelic difference in the buccal cell derived DNA. Though no copy number variation was observed along chromosome 19 (Panel A), there is evidence of allelic imbalance in the proband's DNA extending from 19pter to 19p13.2 (Panel B). Compared to 19p in the parental samples, the proband shows a wider or uneven distribution of the heterozygous SNP markers (AB). In contrast, in regions without allelic imbalance such as pericentromeric 19p and 19q, there is a typical display of the homozygous (AA or BB) or heterozygous (AB) calls.\n\nBecause a concern for possible Noonan syndrome was raised for Patient 5 due to low-set ears, wide neck and familial ptosis, we searched the exome data for likely pathogenic mutations in rasopathy genes (PTPN11; RAF1; SOS1; RIT1; KRAS;HRAS;NRAS; SHOC2; MEK1; MEK2; BRAF) and none was found.\n\nFamily 6\n\nNo likely pathogenic mutation was identified in Patient 6",

As no data are available for the Tunisian population, the lipid values were compared to the 95th percentile of the levels found in the European populations suggesting a condition of hypobetalipoproteinemia. The duodenal biopsy showed the presence of enterocyte vacuolization specifically at the tip of the villi suggestive of fat accumulation (Figure 3). Proband’s parents (Table 1) had a normal plasma lipid profile, strongly suggesting that the child might have ABL. The analysis of MTTP gene revealed that the proband was homozygous for a novel deletion in the exon 18 (c. 2611delC) expected to cause a frameshift in the mRNA by changing the sequence of the 23 last amino acids on C-terminal domain (residues 604–894) and adding 3 amino acids. The translation product of this abnormal mRNA is an MTP protein containing 898 amino acids (p.H871I fsX29) instead of 894 amino acids of the normal protein (Additional file 1). Proband’s parents were heterozygous.\n\nThe second proband of family D (subject II.2, in Figure 2 and Table 2) had extremely low plasma lipids. Plasma LDL-C and apoB were undetectable. The duodenal biopsy showed the presence of enterocyte vacuolization suggesting the presence of lipid droplets (Figure 4). Proband’s father (subject I.2 in Table 2) had a normal plasma lipid profile. Although the proband’s mother (subject I.1 in Table 2) had plasma levels of TC, LDL-C and apoB below the 95th percentile of the levels found in the European populations it was not possible to define to what extent the values observed in proband’s mother diverge from the mean in our population. The proband’s brother (subject II.1 in Table 2) had also low plasma lipids.\n\nIn view of the lipid profile of proband’s parents and because we already described a Tunisian ABL family whith hypocholesteroleima in one of his parents, we assumed that the proband might be affected by ABL. The sequence of MTTP gene showed that the proband was homozygous for (c.923 G > A) mutation in exon 8. The result is a truncated protein of 307 amino acids, as opposed to the 894 amino acids, devoid of function.

    "content": "Results\n\nWES of the index MCL case identifies loss of function mutations in SETD2\n\nAmong the mutated genes found in neoplastic MCs but not in saliva, SETD2 stood out among others because of its known role as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in various solid tumors and in acute leukemias. Notably, two distinct putatively inactivating heterozygous mutations were identified in the patient, a nonsense mutation in exon 15 (NM_014159:c.G6753T:p.Glu2234Ter) and a frameshift insertion in exon 20 (NM_014159:c.7595_7596insC:p.Gly2515ArgfsTer5) (Figures 1a and b). Cloning of a cDNA fragment encompassing both mutant residues showed that the mutations were biallelic. The first mutation was predicted to result in a truncated protein lacking 330 amino acids at the C-terminal, whereas the second mutation was predicted to result in a truncated protein lacking 46 amino acids at the C-terminal. Western blotting, however, showed that only the SETD2-truncated isoform resulting from the nonsense mutation was expressed in neoplastic MCs (Figure 1c). This truncated protein (tSETD2) lacked the highly conserved SRI domain (Figure 1b). The normal SETD2 protein is responsible for trimethylation of lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36Me3). Co-immunoprecipitation showed that tSETD2 lost the ability to bind the H3 histone and, most importantly, western blotting showed that H3K36Me3 was abrogated (Figure 1c). The SRI domain is also known to mediate SETD2 interaction with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II large subunit and with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-L, thus coupling H3K36Me3 with transcription and splicing. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that tSETD2 did not bind either protein (Figure 1c), further underpinning the loss of function nature of the SETD2 mutations found in the index case.\n\nLOH at the SETD2 locus is detectable in SM patients\n\nThe SETD2 gene maps to chromosome 3p21, where allelic loss due to deletions or copy neutral (CN)-LOH has frequently been observed in kidney, lung, breast and many other cancer samples and cell lines. We thus examined the copy number status and searched for LOH at 3p21 in 13 cases of the validation cohort (eight MCL, four ASM, one ISM) for whom SNP-array data were available. CN-LOH of a small region ranging from 613 kb to 2.02 Mb at 3p21.3 was found in 10/13 cases (7 MCL, 2 ASM, 1 ISM). The minimal common region (MCR) of LOH included SETD2 and nine additional genes (CCDC12, NBEAL2, NRADDP, KIF9-AS1, KIF9, KLH18, PTPN23, SCAP, ELP6) (Supplementary Figure 1). We thus extended the screen for LOH specifically at 3p21.3 in the remaining patients of the validation cohort. Genotyping of nine SNPs with minor allele frequency>40% in the MCR was suggestive of LOH in 17 additional cases. Thus, overall, LOH was detected in 27/57 (47%) SM patients, namely in 8/11 (72%) MCL-, 11/20 (55%) ASM-, 1/3 SSM- and 7/23 (30%) ISM patients (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nSETD2 and H3K36Me3 deficiency are recurrent events in SM and cluster in advanced disease\n\nTo investigate the frequency of SETD2 inactivation in the validation cohort, we used western blotting to assess H3K36Me3 levels as a surrogate marker of loss of SETD2 function and to screen for the expression of SETD2 full-length vs truncated isoforms. No evidence of abnormal isoforms was found. However, the SETD2 protein turned out to be reduced or not at all expressed in the great majority of patients examined (Figure 2a). H3K36Me3 paralleled SETD2 expression and was reduced or absent accordingly (Figure 2a). In one MCL, one ASM and two ISM patients, SETD2 and H3K36Me3 levels were assessed in total MNC fractions obtained from BM and in purified CD117+ cells in parallel and no differences were observed. To confirm western blotting results, IHC with an anti-SETD2 antibody was performed on BM trephine biopsies of patients displaying various SETD2 protein levels. The intensity of nuclear staining and the percentage of immunostained atypical MCs varied among the cases and were consistent with SETD2 protein expression as assessed by western blotting (Supplementary Figure 2). Internal positive controls (BM myeloid precursors and megakaryocytes) were present in each case and confirmed the specificity of the stain.\n\nMedian SETD2 and H3K36Me3 levels, assessed by densitometric analysis of western blotting results (Supplementary Table 3), were significantly correlated with each other (Spearman R=0.91, P<0.001) and were lower in advanced SM (R=0.57, P<0.001) (Figures 2b and c). In particular, patients with MCL and ASM displayed significantly lower levels of SETD2 and H3K36Me3 as compared to ISM",

In particular, patients with MCL and ASM displayed significantly lower levels of SETD2 and H3K36Me3 as compared to ISM (SETD2: P=<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively; H3K36Me3: P⩽0.001 and P=0.004, respectively). There seemed to be no differences in SETD2 expression between advanced SM patients with (n=8) or without (n=26) AHN. When the distribution of SETD2 protein levels within the ASM and ISM subgroups was examined, no significant differences regarding baseline clinical variables or survival emerged between cases with SETD2 <0.5 and >0.5 (data not shown). However, when patients with SETD2>0.5 and <0.5 were compared regardless of disease subtype, lower SETD2 expression was found to be associated with older age (P=0.02), higher serum tryptase levels (P=0.03), lower hemoglobin (P=0.03) and platelet count (P=0.005). In addition, patients with lower SETD2 levels were more likely to have splenomegaly (P=0.04) and less likely to have skin lesions (P=0.03). There was also a trend towards shorter overall survival (P=0.06) (data not shown). There seemed to be no preferential association between SETD2 loss of function and the presence or absence of specific additional mutations or mutation patterns in myeloid genes (for example, SF3B1, SRSF2, TET2, ASXL1 and so on; Supplementary Table 4).\n\nIn an attempt to explain the nonrandom accumulation of LOH at 3p21.3 and the observed SETD2 protein deficiency, we sequenced the entire SETD2 gene, including the promoter region, in all the patients of the validation cohort. Only one ASM patient (who had no evidence of 3p21.3 LOH) had a missense mutation (c.1351A>G; p.Thr451Ala) not reported as a SNP (Supplementary Table 5). The mutation was not found either in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutatons in Cancer or in ClinVar databases and was predicted to be benign/tolerated by Mutation Taster and Polyphen-2. Thus, despite LOH, the classical two-hit hypothesis of tumor suppressor gene inactivation was found not to be the case for SETD2 in SM.\n\nWe then assessed whether promoter hypermethylation might be responsible for SETD2 protein deficiency, in the presence or absence of LOH. Analysis of the SETD2 promoter showed <1% methylated DNA in all the patients of the validation cohort. Methylation levels were not different from those of healthy donors. Other mechanisms of transcriptional down-regulation were excluded, since SETD2 mRNA levels were not significantly lower in the validation cohort as compared to healthy donors.\n\nTo rule out the possibility that SETD2 loss of function might be another age-associated alteration in an epigenetic regulator, 80 healthy older adults with an age ranging from 65 to 95 years were screened for SETD2 mutations and for alterations in SETD2 protein expression or H3K36Me3. No sequence variants other than the Pro1962Leu and the Asn1155Asn SNPs were detected. All the older adults did express SETD2; and densitometric analysis of western blots (done using a pool of 10 younger adults with an age ranging from 20 to 30 years as a calibrator, after having excluded inter-individual variations of expression) showed comparable SETD2 and H3K36Me3 levels among individual older adults as well as between older and younger adults (Supplementary Table 6).\n\nWe next wondered whether the HMC-1 cell line, established from a patient with MCL, also exhibits SETD2 and H3K36Me3 deficiency. Indeed, western blotting revealed no SETD2 protein and no H3K36Me3 in either subclone (Figure 3a). Sequencing ruled out the presence of SETD2 gene mutations. Similarly to the patients of the validation cohort, both HMC-1.1 and HMC-1.2 cells were found to have no significant reduction in SETD2 transcript levels as compared to SETD2 wild-type cell lines and the gene promoter was found to have very low methylation levels (4.08% and 1.08% in HMC-1.1 and HMC-1.2, respectively). This suggested that similar mechanism(s) acting at the translational or post-translational level underlie SETD2 deficiency in advanced SM patients and in HMC-1 cells.\n\nSETD2 deficiency results from enhanced proteasomal degradation\n\nIn HMC-1 cells, incubation with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (10 nm for 24 h) rescued SETD2 protein expression and restored H3K36Me3 levels (Figure 3b), indicating that a functional SETD2 protein is regularly translated in neoplastic MCs, and that failure to detect it by western blotting is rather due to altered turnover and proteasomal degradation.

Co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-SETD2 antibody after bortezomib treatment showed that blockage of proteasome-mediated degradation results in accumulation of ubiquitinated and SUMOylated SETD2 (Figure 4a). We therefore speculated that reduced or undetectable SETD2 expression in advanced SM patients might be accounted for by hyper-ubiquitination and -SUMOylation leading to proteasomal degradation. We thus compared the effects of proteasome inhibition in malignant MCs from advanced SM patients displaying no SETD2 protein and from ISM patients with near-normal SETD2 levels. In contrast to SETD2-deficient patients, where results were superimposable to those obtained in HMC-1 cells, patients with near-normal SETD2 expression had similar levels of ubiquitinated and SUMOylated SETD2 protein (and similar H3K36Me3 levels) before and after the inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation (Figure 4b).\n\nBortezomib and the combination of Midostaurin+AZD1775 reduce colony growth and induce apoptosis in HMC-1 cells\n\nGiven the ability of bortezomib to rescue SETD2 expression and H3K36Me3, we tested whether proteasome inhibition might be effective in vitro in HMC-1 cells. Bortezomib as single agent strikingly inhibited colony formation (LD50 in HMC-1.1=0.173 nM; LD50 in HMC-1.2=0.226 nM)(Figure 5a) and induced apoptosis in these cells (Figures 5f and g). Combination with D816V KIT tyrosine kinase inhibition by midostaurin did not increase significantly bortezomib efficacy (Supplementary Figure 3).\n\nRecently, a synthethic lethality interaction between H3K36Me3 deficiency and enhancement of replicative stress via Wee1 G2 checkpoint Serine/Threonine protein kinase inhibition has been uncovered. As a consequence, inhibition of Wee1 with AZD1775 was found to kill SETD2/H3K36Me3-deficient cells. We thus decided to explore also the in vitro efficacy of a strategy using AZD1775 alone or in combination with midostaurin in HMC-1 cells. AZD1775+midostaurin combination suppressed colony growth with a LD50 of 0.036 μm and 0.038 μm for HMC-1.1 and -1.2, respectively (Figure 5b; results of AZD1775 and midostaurin as single agents shown in Figures 5c and d; summary of LD50 values in Figure 5e). When compared to either agent alone, AZD1775+midostaurin combination displayed a strong synergistic effect in apoptotic cell death induction in HMC-1.1 cells, whereas only an additive effect was observed in HMC-1.2 cells (Supplementary Table 7).\n\nBortezomib and the combination of AZD1775+midostaurin reduce the clonogenic potential of SETD2/H3K36Me3-deficient neoplastic MCs\n\nWe next assessed the effects of bortezomib, AZD1775, midostaurin and AZD1775+midostaurin combination on the clonogenic potential of neoplastic MCs from two patients with MCL with no SETD2 expression (MCL3 and MCL7) and one patient with ASM (ASM18) with very low SETD2 expression (20% as compared to a pool of healthy donors). Growth inhibition curves and LD50 values are shown in Figure 6. Bortezomib induced a marked dose-dependent reduction in colony formation with LD50 ranging from 0.105 to 0.295 nm (Figure 6a). The combination of AZD1775+midostaurin appeared to be slightly superior to the single agent strategy in MCL3 and ASM18, with LD50 values of 0.054 and 0.058 μm, respectively, but not in MCL7 where AZD1775 as single agent showed the lowest LD50 (0.026 μM for AZD1775 alone as against 0.048 μm for the combination; Figures 6b–e).",

This may be due to the limited population of subjects with the study (Riyadh city only).\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of patients and control participating in this study are reported in Table 1. The mean age of the CRC patient was 55.90±1.56 years and that of the control was 55.20±1.42 years. The patient and the control groups were matched for gender and BMI (p>0.05).\n\nInterleukin-8 gene (rs4073 T/A) polymorphism\n\nThe rs4073 T/A polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-8 gene was assayed in samples from patients with CRC and controls. Table 2 presents the base pairs in the wild type homozygous (TT), heterozygous (TA), and homozygous for the variant (AA). Overall, distributions of the various alleles of IL-8 (rs4073) T/A did not differ significantly between patients with CRC and controls.

Allele frequency showed significant decreased of the G allele to CC with p=0.022, and this was also confirmed by an OR of 0.47. Having one or more copy of allele (G) conferred an decrease in CRC risk (p=0.062, OR=0.13). The homozygous for the variant GG was decreased among patients with CRC (OR=0.06) but did not reach significance.\n\nThe IL-22 (rs2227485: C/T) polymorphism in the promoter region was assessed. The base sequence identified in this region in the wild type homozygous (CC), heterozygous (CT), and homozygous for the variant (TT). We did not found significant association between rs2227485 C/T SNPs of IL-22 and the risk of developing CRC in the overall investigated Saudi population.

These results are summarized in Table 5. The majority of patients and controls were homozygous for the variant type allele (GG). However, a slightly association between IL-27 (rs17855750 T/G) genotypes and risk of developing CRC was observed as a decrease in the GG genotype was observed in the CRC group (85.7% vs. 95.7%, OR=0.09). A significant association between the G allele protective effect against CRC is observed (OR=0.20, p=0.005).\n\nTransforming growth factor-ß1 gene (rs1800469 C/T) polymorphism\n\nThe TGFß1 (rs1800469 C/T) polymorphism in the promoter region was assayed.Table 6 shows the genotype and allele frequency of the C and T alleles in patients and controls.

Clear tendency for a decrease in the CT genotype was observed in the CRC group (45.7% vs. 54.3%, OR=0.15, p=0.009). The TT genotype was significantly decreased in the patients (OR= 0.16, p=0.014). When considering the recessive model (CT + TT versus CC), high significant association was observed between CC genotype and occurrence of CRC (p=0.009). T allele was slightly lower in the CRC patients compared to the control group but failed to reach significance (p=0.161, OR=0.68).",

    "content": "Results:\n\nThe PEER DNA cohort included an analysis of 741 children with an MPS analysis of the TSLP gene. From the full PEER DNA cohort of 741 children, 326 children were of African-American ancestry, 379 were white, 21 children of other ancestries, and 15 children multiple ancestries. 53.2% (394) of the children were female, the average age of AD onset was 1.99 (sd: 2.76) years, and 78.6% and 56.4% of the children had completed five and the full 10 years of PEER enrollment, respectively. Overall 44.4% of children had at least one six-month period of AD remission. MPS revealed 156 variants in TSLP. This study focused on rs1898671.\n\nThe minor variant frequency (MVF) for rs1898671 (C substituted by T) was 23.5% (95% CI: 21.4, 25.8) for the full cohort, 9.8% (7.6, 12.4) for children of African-American ancestry, and 34.9% (31.6, 38.3) for white children. For comparison, we obtained population based frequencies from the Genome Aggregation Database, gnomAD, (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/), and found that European (non-Finnish) controls have MVF 27.5% (26.3, 29.7) and African controls have 9.8% (8.7, 11.1). In other words, white PEER DNA children with AD are less likely to have rs1898671 variant (1.41 (1.20, 1.66)) than the more general population but African-American children are equally likely (1.00 (0.73, 1.13) as the genomAD African population. Per GTEx (https://gtexportal.org/home/snp/rs1898671), the measured TSLP mRNA in skin of the lower leg and suprapubic regions is increased by rs1898671 variation.\n\nAt enrollment children, with rs1898671 were more likely to have a food, animal and medication allergies than children in PEER who did not have the variant, but were not more likely to have asthma, seasonal allergies, concomitant FLG LoF variant, or an earlier AD disease onset (Table 1). Compared to white children, African-American children with the rs1898671 variant also had many more additional TSLP variants (Table 2). However, these variants do not appear to be in linkage with rs1898671 (Table 2). MVF for all of the other variants as well as the most common (≥ 10%) TSLP variants not co-occuring with rs1898671 are reported in Table 2 and Supplement Table 1–3). Overall very few common variants were noted. One haplotype block was identified for the white children (Figure 1) and no haplotype blocks were identified for African-American children.\n\nChildren with the rs1898671 variant, were more likely to have a remission period (Table 3 and Figure 2). Children with the rs1898671 variant at any given survey were more likely to have a remission than children who were wildtype for rs1898671 (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.26, 1.91) (Table 3)). This effect was greater for African-American than white children and appears to be greater in those with a FLG LoF variant (Table 3). In addition to rs1898671, the SNPs in the haplotype for the white children included rs10062929, rs2289276, and rs11466741 (Figure 2). Neither of the haplotypes nor the individual SNPs were associated with remission (Table 3).\n\nAt this time, the GAD cohort includes 585 individuals including 337 individuals with AD and 238 individuals without AD, respectively. The average age of enrollment was 33.6 years (sd: 21.7), the average age of disease onset for those with AD was 6.8 years (sd: 13.8). 56.7% were female and 49.2% were African-American. The rs1898671 MVF was 21.6% (18.9, 23.7) for the full GAD, 12.0% (9.4, 14.9) for African-Americans and 31.9% (27.8, 36.1) for whites. Individuals with rs1898671 were less likely to have AD (1.48 (1.12, 1.96)). This effect is not significantly different between African-Americans and for whites (p=0.150). The rs1898671 variant AD protective effect was found to be greater in heterozygotes (1.91 (1.34, 2.75)) than homozygotes (1.28 (0.61, 2.70)). Individuals with AD and the rs1898671 variant tend to have a later age of onset of their AD (wildype-6.2 years (sd: 11.8), heterozygous-7.6 years (sd:16.6) years and homozygous-9.0 years (sd:19.6)). The median POEM score was of 12 (moderate eczema severity) (25%: 6 (mild), 75%:17 (severe)) for GAD group with AD and was not associated with rs1898671 variation.",

    "content": "Results\n\nPatient characteristics\n\nA total of 387 unrelated asthmatic patients and 212 unrelated healthy controls were included in the analysis of the NYUBAR population. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. A majority of the cases and controls were women and were never-smokers. The average age of the cases was slightly but significantly higher than that of the control group (40.1 vs. 36.1, p = 0.0015) and the average BMI of the cases was significantly higher than the control group (29.9 vs. 27.2, p<0.0001). The self-reported race/ethnicity also differed between cases and controls (p = 0.01). Consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, lung function differed significantly between cases and controls, with reduced % of predicted FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC in cases compared to controls. Cases had a significantly higher total IgE and more cases were atopic.\n\nPopulation stratification\n\nThe first and second principal components from the PCA using 213 AIMs were plotted in Figure 1 with self-reported race/ethnicity information. The first principal component scores showed good separation between the self-reported non-Hispanic white group and the self-reported non-Hispanic black group, while the principal component scores of self-reported Hispanic group were in-between. The first five principal components counted for more than 80% of variability of the ancestry markers. The STRUCTURE method estimates the posterior probability that each subject belongs to each underlying population for each individual. When included as covariates to adjust population stratification in the association tests, the STRUCTURE method resulted in similar results to the PCA method and thus the STRUCTURE results are not reported.\n\nTSLP and asthma susceptibility\n\nThe results of association analysis of asthma and TSLP SNPs are summarized in Table 2. One SNP (rs1898671) was nominally associated with asthma susceptibility in the overall population after adjusting for covariates and population stratification (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.09–2.05, p = 0.01). However, the risk of asthma was increased for this SNP when analyzed in the subgroup of ex-smokers, (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.04–30.83, p = 0.04). In the subgroup of never-smokers, SNP rs1898671 did not show significant association with the risk of asthma (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.93–1.94, p = 0.11).\n\nBecause of the suggestion of an association of SNP rs1898671 with asthma, we examined whether the association of this SNP with asthma susceptibility could be replicated in the APCAT cohorts that combined 6 cohorts with 1716 asthma cases and 16888 controls. Analysis of this large cohort revealed consistent results with a positive association between rs1898671 and asthma (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07–1.23, p = 0.0003). When stratified by smoking history, the replication cohort validated the finding in the NYU cohort that the SNP affected risk in ex-smokers (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08–1.34, p = 0.003), whereas no significant association was found in never-smokers.\n\nTSLP haplotype analysis\n\nReconstructed haplotypes with estimated frequencies of greater than 5% are listed in Table 3 and the estimated haplotype-specific OR with respect to the reference haplotype group (defined as the group with highest frequency) and p-values are also reported. The second most frequent haplotype (GAGGGCAAAG) had an estimated frequency of 24% and showed a significant increased risk with asthma after adjusting age, BMI and population stratification (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.10–2.27, p = 0.01).",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nPTPN2/22 SNP allele frequency in CD\n\nAllele frequency of the nine SNPs examined in PTPN2/22 found in both CD subjects and healthy controls are shown in Figure 2. All genotyped samples were found in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Out of the four SNPs found in PTPN2 (rs1893217, rs2542151, rs7234029, and rs478582), rs478582 was significant in the CD, where heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles when examined together were detected in 57/69 (82.6%) in CD compared to 36/59 (61.0%) healthy controls (OR = 3.03, 95%CI: 1.35-6.84, P-values < 0.05, Figure 2A). Specifically, the heterozygous (TC) alleles were detected in 38/69 (55.1%) CD compared to the 28/59 (47.5%) of healthy controls, while homozygous (CC) alleles were detected in 19/69 (27.5%) CD compared to 8/59 (13.6%) healthy controls. SNPs rs1893217, rs2542151, and rs7234029 were found to be not significant in CD compared to the healthy controls. Out of the five SNPs specific to PTPN22 (rs2476601, rs2488457, rs33996649, rs34209542, and rs2476599), none of SNPs were considered significant in CD compared to the healthy controls (Figure 2B). However, since PTPN22:rs2476601 is found significantly in various inflammatory autoimmune diseases, we continued to investigate the SNP in more detail along with PTPN2:rs478582. For PTPN22:rs2476601, CD with either heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles were detected in 11/70 (15.7%) subjects, while 4/62 (6.45%) was detected in healthy controls (OR = 2.7, 95%CI: 0.81-8.98, P-values > 0.05). Specifically, the heterozygous (GA) alleles were detected in 10/70 (14.3%) CD compared to the 4/62 (6.45%) of healthy controls, while homozygous (AA) alleles were rare in all samples.\n\nFor confirmation that CD subjects were significant in having SNP alleles for PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601, determination of haplotype combinations were done (Figure 2C). Examination of the following haplotype combinations between PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 were examined: T-G, C-G, T-A, and C-A. The T-G haplotype (major/major) was found more significantly in the healthy controls (21/59 = 35.6%) than in CD (10/69 = 14.5%, P-values < 0.05). The C-G haplotype (heterozygous or minor/major) and the C-A (heterozygous or minor/heterozygous or minor) were found more in CD (48/69 = 69.6%; 9/69 = 13.0%, respectively) than in healthy controls (34/59 = 57.6%; 2/59 = 3.39%, respectively). The C-A haplotype was found more significantly in CD than the healthy controls (P-values < 0.05).\n\nRelationship of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on expression of PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ in CD\n\nThe average relative gene expression (2(-∆CT) × 1000) of PTPN2, regardless of SNPs, in CD was significantly lower (5.27 ± 2.68, n = 38) than in healthy controls (10.5 ± 6.95, n = 30, P-values < 0.05, Figure 3A). Similarly, the average relative gene expression of PTPN22, regardless of SNPs, was also significantly lower in CD (1.76 ± 1.12, n = 38) than in healthy controls (3.24 ± 1.84, n = 30, P-values < 0.05, Figure 3B). The evaluation of the effect of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on expression of PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ was determined.\n\nFor subjects with either heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582, regardless of disease, expression of PTPN2 did not change when compared to the normal (TT) subjects. However, when examining the CD and healthy control subjects in each allele group, CD overall had a lower average relative gene expression of PTPN2. The average relative gene expression in CD with heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582 was significantly lower (5.34 ± 2.77, n = 31) compared to 10.2 ± 7.15 (n = 21) in healthy controls with similar SNPs (P-values < 0.05).

The average relative gene expression of IFN-γ in CD subjects with the PTPN2:rs478582 heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) allele was 0.41 ± 0.31 (n = 38), which was significantly higher compared to the CD subjects with normal (TT) alleles (0.21 ± 0.22, n = 12, P < 0.05). Specifically, CD subjects with the heterozygous (TC) allele had significantly higher (0.41 ± 0.31, n = 24, P < 0.05) IFN-γ relative gene expression than CD subjects with normal (TT) alleles, while CD subjects with the minor (CC) alleles had higher gene expression as well (0.40 ± 0.31, n = 14). There was no significant change in IFN-γ relative gene expression in the CD subjects with the PTPN22:rs2476601 heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles. However, in healthy controls, subjects with the heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles had a significantly higher gene expression (0.67 ± 0.28, n = 4, P < 0.05) than healthy controls with normal (GG) alleles (0.40 ± 0.21, n = 20).\n\nEffect of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on susceptibility of MAP infection in CD\n\nOverall detection of MAP IS900 DNA was found in CD and healthy control subjects and were correlated with PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 (Table 2). Out of 70 CD subjects, 43 (61.4%) were positive for MAPbacteremia compared to only 4/48 (9.33%) of healthy controls (P < 0.05, OR = 17.5, 95%CI: 5.65-54.3).\n\nCorrelation analyses with PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 along with MAP infection was done on CD and healthy controls to see if these SNPs increase MAP susceptibility (Table 2).

CD subjects who had MAPbacteremia presence had an average relative gene expression of 5.25 ± 2.58 (n = 21) in PTPN2 compared to the healthy controls with MAPbacteremia presence (11.9 ± 10.5, n =3, P < 0.05). CD subjects who had an absence of MAPbacteremia presence had an average relative gene expression of 5.28 ± 2.87 (n = 17) in PTPN2 compared to the healthy controls without MAPbacteremia presence (10.3 ± 6.71, n = 27, P < 0.05). For PTPN22 average relative gene expression, CD subjects with MAPbacteremia presence had 1.73 ± 0.97 (n = 21) compared to healthy controls with MAPbacteremia presence (2.83 ± 1.94, n = 3).

Similarly, when the same T-cells were treated with MAP PPD-like, the average overall fold change in CD subjects was 2.01 ± 0.79 (n = 5) compared to the healthy controls (1.39 ± 0.24 fold increase, n = 5).\n\nOut of the five CD subjects, 3/5 were tested for having MAPbacteremia presence. When examining T-cells treated with PHA from CD subjects tested positive for MAPbacteremia presence, the average overall fold change was 2.7 ± 1.65 (n = 3) compared to the CD subjects’ T-cells that were absence of MAPbacteremia presence and treated with PHA (1.51 ± 0.51 fold increase, n = 2). Similarly, when the same T-cells were treated with MAP PPD-like, the average overall fold change in CD subjects with MAPbacteremia was 2.5 ± 0.59 (n = 3) compared to the CD subjects’ T-cells without MAPbacteremia presence (1.27 ± 0.12 fold increase, n = 2).",

    "content": "Results\n\nDelineation of peripheral B cell subsets\n\nSeven major CD19+ B cell subsets were discriminated by flow cytometry in PBMCs from 91 donors, namely 45 T1D patients and 46 healthy controls (Fig. 1a and Supporting information, Table S2). All assessed B cell phenotypes were found to be highly reproducible in two independent measurements obtained from 18 different subjects (ρ > 0·77; Supporting information, Table S2). The only notable exception was the CD19+CD27− immunoglobulin D (IgD)+IgM− anergic B cell subset (ρ = 0·359; Supporting information, Table S2), which was therefore not assessed further in this study. To investigate a putative immunoregulatory defect in T1D patients, we assessed the frequency of two B cell subsets with suspected regulatory function, CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi transitional B cells and CD19+CD5+ (CD5+ B cells), as well as CD19+CD27+IgD+IgM+ (marginal zone) B cells. In addition to surface immunophenotyping, we assessed the intracellular production of IL-10 by total (CD19+), naive (CD19+CD27−) and memory (CD19+CD27+) B cells cultured in the presence of IL-21, following in-vitro stimulation (Fig. 1).\n\nThe peripheral B cell compartment in T1D\n\nWe first investigated the association of the delineated B cell phenotypes with T1D using a paired analysis of 45 T1D patients and 45 healthy donors, matched for age, sex and time of sample preparation. We found no evidence for a systematic difference in the frequency of any of the assessed B cell subsets in T1D patients (Fig. 2 and Table 2). In particular, we found no difference in the frequency of naive [P = 0·52, mean of differences = −1·15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −4·71 to 2·41] or memory (P = 0·54, mean of differences = 1·04, 95% CI = −2·38 to 4·46) B cells or in the two subsets of B cells with a suspected regulatory function, CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi (P = 0·50, mean of differences = −0·36, 95% CI = −1·42 to 0·71) and CD5+ (P = 0·25, mean of differences = 2·34, 95% CI = −1·70 to 6·37) B cells, previously linked with T1D (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Similarly, we also found no evidence for a variation in the frequency of these B cell subsets according to the time since T1D diagnosis (Supporting information, Table S3). Taking the observed distribution of CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi B cells in our study as a model, we have > 80% statistical power to detect alterations of more than 35 and 40% in the frequency of these cells between patients and healthy controls at a 5 and 1% significance level, respectively (Fig. 3). Because the distribution of the different B cell subsets was relatively uniform in our study (Fig. 4), the power calculations obtained for the CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi subset can be generalized more broadly for the other B cell subsets, and suggest that we have only adequate power to detect changes of > 35–40% in each of the assessed phenotypes.\n\nGiven the dependence of IL-21 signalling on the differentiation of CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi B cells, we also assessed the surface expression of IL-21R on these B cell subsets in T1D and healthy controls. However, we found no evidence of a differential expression of this receptor in T1D patients in any of the assessed B cell subsets (Table 2).\n\nTo investigate a potential immunoregulatory defect in the B cell compartment of T1D patients, we next assessed the frequency of IL-10+ B cells by intracellular immunostaining in magnetically purified CD19+ B cells isolated from the same donors, and cultured in the presence of IL-21 for 3 days to induce the differentiation of IL-10-secreting CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi B cells, as described previously. We found no evidence for a functional difference in the production of IL-10 in CD19+, naive and memory B cells isolated from T1D patients compared to healthy controls (Fig. 4 and Table 2), or for an alteration in the production of this cytokine according to the duration of the disease (Supporting information, Table S3).\n\nAge-dependent changes in the composition of the human peripheral B cell compartment\n\nAge is known to have a strong effect on the differentiation of the adult immune system. Given the lack of association of T1D with the assessed B cell phenotypes, we next performed a linear regression analysis, combining all 91 donors included in this study, to identify age-related changes in the differentiation of the peripheral B cell compartment. The frequency of circulating total CD19+ B cells showed a strong negative correlation with age (ρ = −0·385, P = 1·63 × 10−4; Fig. 5a and Table 3). This variation corresponded to an average decrease of 0·21% in CD19+ B cells per year (Fig. 5a). We also confirmed the significant decrease of naive (ρ = −0·389, P = 1·40 ×",

This variation corresponded to an average decrease of 0·21% in CD19+ B cells per year (Fig. 5a). We also confirmed the significant decrease of naive (ρ = −0·389, P = 1·40 × 10−4) and the concomitant increase of memory B cells (ρ = 0·395, P = 1·07 × 10−4) with age (Fig. 5b,c and Table 3). Consistently, we observed a negative correlation with age in the two naive B cell subsets that exhibit suspected regulatory properties – CD5+ B cells (ρ = −0·428, P = 2·21 × 10−4) and CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi B cells (ρ = −0·558, P = 9·09 × 10−9), while the memory subset of marginal zone B cells showed a positive correlation with age (ρ = 0·339, P = 1·01 × 10−3; Fig. 5d–f and Table 3). The negative correlation with age was particularly noticeable in CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi B cells, where age explained more than 31% of the trait's variance (R2 = 31·1%). This variation reflected a sharp reduction of the CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi B cell frequency from an average 8·7% in individuals aged less than 15 years to 3·7% in individuals aged more than 30 years, and corresponded to an average decrease of 0·2% per year (Fig. 5b and Table 3). The decreased frequency of the peripheral B cell subsets with age was even more apparent when analysing the absolute number of B cells in 55 of the 91 donors, where full blood counts were assessed (Supporting information, Fig. S1). These data provide a quantitative measure of the striking age-dependent changes observed in the absolute numbers of CD19+ cells, and demonstrate that there is a rapid decline in peripheral B cell numbers with age, which is particularly pronounced in naive (CD27−) subsets (Supporting information, Fig. S1).\n\nThe rate of age-dependent changes did not differ between T1D patients and healthy controls (Supporting information, Fig. S2), indicating that the notable variation in the frequency of B cell subsets with age is not a consequence of a disease-specific mechanism, nor is the decline a major predisposing factor for T1D.\n\nGenetic regulation of the B cell compartment\n\nAmong the T1D genomic risk loci identified by genome-wide association studies, at least six harbour candidate genes that have been implicated directly in B cell differentiation and function (PTPN22, BACH2, PTPN2, IL2–IL21, IL10 and SH2B3; http://www.T1DBase.org). To investigate the potential genetic regulation of the assessed B cell phenotypes, we tested the association of these traits with the genetic risk variants in these six loci, taking into account the strong age-dependent effects observed in this study. This genetic association analysis was limited by sample size, particularly for variants with low minor allele frequency. To account for multiple testing we have therefore used a conservative P-value threshold of 1·39 × 10−3, based on a Bonferroni correction for 36 independent tests, to report significant association with genotype.\n\nWe found no evidence for a major genetic association with the frequency of peripheral B cell subsets (Table 4). For IL-10 production by B cells, we obtained evidence for association of the minor allele at IL2–IL21 (rs2069763 G > T), which confers increased risk for T1D, with decreased production of IL-10 in memory B cells (P = 6·4 × 10−4; Table 5). This association equated to a reduction of 57·8% in the mean frequency of IL-10+ memory B cells in the rare [TT] homozygotes (mean = 5·09%; n = 11) compared to [GG] homozygotes (mean = 12·06%; n = 26). To further investigate the role of genetic variation in the IL2–IL21 locus in the regulation of IL-10 secretion, we next sought replication of these findings in an independent data set of CD4+ T cells stimulated with β cell-specific antigens. We found a consistent association between the rs2069763[T] allele and decreased numbers of IL-10+ islet antigen autoreactive CD4+ T cells (P = 2·9 × 10−3; Table 5), which supports a common regulatory mechanism for the production of this anti-inflammatory cytokine in both cell types mediated by the rs2069763 polymorphism in the IL2–IL21 locus. Similarly to the genotype effect observed in the B cell data set, we found that the association in autoreactive CD4+ T cells corresponded to a 28·8% decrease in IL-10+ T cells in [TT] homozygotes (n = 1064) compared to [GG] homozygotes (n = 335).\n\nIn addition to the association with IL2–IL21, we also observed suggestive evidence for the association of PTPN2, a gene encoding a protein phosphatase involved in the negative regulation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling pathway, with reduced frequency",

To further investigate the effect of this T1D risk allele, we assessed the frequency of B cell subsets in an independent cohort of age-matched 21 Arg620 homozygous and 19 Trp620 homozygous healthy volunteers. We found no difference in the frequency of the assessed B cell phenotypes between the two genotype groups (P = 0·39; Fig. 6). This result was consistent with the lack of association of PTPN22 with frequency of transitional CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi B cells both in the 86 immunophenotyped donors with available genotype data (P = 0·52; Table 4) or when restricting the analysis to the 46 non-diabetic donors (25 unaffected siblings and 21 adult healthy controls; P = 0·38). The very low frequency of Trp620 homozygous donors in the general population (< 1% in European and European-ancestry populations) has previously prevented the investigation of the frequency of CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi cells in Trp620 homozygotes. Importantly, by comparing the mean frequency of CD19+CD27−CD24hiCD38hi B cells in the two homozygous groups, our data suggest that the estimated effect size corresponds to an absolute increase of 0·415% per copy of the Trp620 allele (95% CI = −0·540, 1·371), assuming an additive effect model, which suggests that any effect in Trp620 homozygous donors may be lower than reported previously.",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nPTPN22 expression varies by lymphocyte subset and activation state.\n\nWe examined endogenous PTPN22 expression in human naïve, memory, and regulatory CD4+ T cell subsets at rest and following in vitro activation. CD4+ T cells were sorted from leukopacks determined to be homozygous for the T1D non-risk allele, which encodes LYP-620R. Since the transcriptional profile of activated cells is dramatically altered from that of the quiescent state, such that the standard array of housekeeping genes is broadly upregulated, we employed absolute quantification to assess PTPN22 expression. At rest, naïve Tconv expressed significantly less PTPN22 (387±83 transcripts/ng total RNA) than memory Tconv cells (741±169 transcripts/ng total RNA, P < 0.05) and Tregs (1014±120 transcripts/ng total RNA, P < 0.001) (Figure 1A). Following polyclonal activation, all three subsets rapidly increased PTPN22 expression, peaking at 24 hours (Figure 1B). Naïve CD4+ Tconv increased 12.00±5.45 fold from the quiescent state whereas memory Tconv increased 4.01±0.89 fold (P < 0.001 vs. naïve) and Treg increased 2.85±1.31 fold (P < 0.01 vs. naïve). Following the initial increase, PTPN22 expression decreased and plateaued around day 7. Taken together, we found PTPN22 expression to differ across T cell subsets at rest and in response to activation.\n\nOverexpression of PTPN22 decreases TCR signaling.\n\nNext, we examined whether LYP-620R and −620W may differentially modulate T cell function in Tconv and Treg populations. Naïve CD4+ Tconv and Treg were sorted from PBMCs from normal healthy control donors that were homozygous for the T1D non-risk PTPN22 allele (C/C at rs2476601 encoding LYP-620R). Cells were then activated and transduced with a lentivirus to express bicistronic constructs of the non-risk LYP-620R or the risk LYP-620W variant with an eGFP reporter following a 2A element, or with eGFP alone for a vector control condition (Supplemental Figure 1A–B). The cultures were expanded, followed by an extended rest period for a total of 21–28 days to allow for reversion of activation programs. We confirmed stable overexpression of PTPN22 transcripts and LYP protien for each variant (Supplemental Figure 1C–E and Supplemental Figure 2).\n\nThe proximal signaling events resulting from TCR ligation lead to assembly and activation of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) signalosome, followed by diverging downstream signaling pathways. These include calcium signaling and MAPK/ERK pathways. We sought to determine the functional impact of the non-risk and risk LYP variants on these downstream signaling pathways in Tconv and Treg. We first assessed Ca2+ flux by comparing stably transduced cells to non-transduced (eGFP-) internal culture control cells (Supplemental Figure 3). As expected, LYP-620R expressing Tconv exhibited 25.8±3.7% less Ca2+ flux than non-transduced Tconv, whereas transduction with eGFP alone had no effect (Figure 2A). A similar effect was observed for LYP-620R Tregs in which Ca2+ flux was diminished by 40.3±13.3% compared to non-transduced Tregs (Figure 2B). Conversely, LYP-620W expression only resulted in 4.9±1.6% and 7.9±2.7% less Ca2+ flux in Tconv and Treg, respectively (Figure 2A–B). These differences were not different from T cells transduced with eGFP alone. Thus, the risk LYP-620W variant less effectively downregulated TCR-induced Ca2+ flux.\n\nWe next assessed the impact of LYP modulation on the MAPK/ERK pathway via pERK signaling following TCR ligation. As with Ca2+ signaling, we observed decreased pERK relative to mock transfected cells in both Tconv and Tregs when LYP-620R was overexpressed (Figure 2C–D). Once again, the impact of LYP-620W on TCR signaling was diminished in both subsets when compared to LYP-620R. Taken together, these results indicate that the LYP risk variant has a diminished capacity to regulate TCR signaling activity.\n\nThe risk variant of PTPN22 permits increased T cell activation.\n\nIn response to Ca2+ flux and pERK signaling, T cells express receptors on their surface to direct activation. We further explored the impact of LYP variants by examining the experssion of a set of these activation markers. Stably transduced T cells were activated with autologous APCs, and surface expression of activation markers was assessed at 0, 4, 24, 48, 72, and 144 hours by flow cytometry. As expected, CD69, ICOS, CD25, CD226, and PD-1 were observed to be dynamically expressed following Tconv activation (Supplemental Figure 4A–D). Likewise, Tregs also exhibited activation-induced expression kinetics for CD69, ICOS, CD226, CTLA-4 (Supplemental Figure 4E–F). Interestingly, while most activation marker kinetics involved an intensification followed by a reduction of surface expression, the kinetics of CD226 on T",

Likewise, Tregs also exhibited activation-induced expression kinetics for CD69, ICOS, CD226, CTLA-4 (Supplemental Figure 4E–F). Interestingly, while most activation marker kinetics involved an intensification followed by a reduction of surface expression, the kinetics of CD226 on Tregs waned before increasing to a level higher than baseline (Supplemental Figure 4H). When normalized to internal mock-transfected controls, the activation marker kinetics on both Tconv (Figure 3A–E) and Tregs (Figure 3F–J) were blunted by overexpression of LYP-620R, with the exception of CD226 on Tconv (Figure 3D). Similar to what was observed with Ca2+ and pERK signaling, cells expressing the LYP-620W variant were less impacted, supporting the notion that the R620W variant confers a loss-of-function for LYP in terms of modulating of T cell activation.\n\nThe PTPN22 risk variant permits proliferation in Tconv, but not in Treg.\n\nWe demonstrated that the two LYP variants differentially modulate TCR signaling and expression of T cell activation markers. We next asked whether overexpression of the LYP variants would differentially modulate T cell proliferation. Activation-induced proliferation of Tconv and Treg cells was assessed by dilution of cell tracking dye following in vitro activation. Transduced cells (eGFP+) were cultured with mock-transduced (eGFP-) internal culture control cells. The cultures were activated with either anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 with irradiated APCs, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 bound to microbeads, or with PMA and ionomycin. While expression of the eGFP reporter did not affect proliferation, overexpression of LYP-620R reduced APC-mediated proliferation of Tconv and Treg by 35.32±15.30% and 19.80±17.26%, respectively (Figure 4A–B). In Tconv, the LYP-620W variant was once again deficient in its ability to downregulate activation, as it did not impede proliferation to the same degree that was observed for the LYP-620R variant (Figure 4A). However, the LYP-620W variant was capable of blocking Treg proliferation to a similar degree as the LYP-620R variant (Figure 4B), indicating a differential impact of PTPN22 on Tconv and Tregs.\n\nAs expected, mitogenic activation by PMA and ionomycin was not altered by LYP overexpression, as all transduced Tconv and Treg proliferated to a comparable degree as their internal mock control cells (Figure 4A–B). Unexpectedly however, proliferation was also unaltered in transduced cells that were activated by microbeads (Figure 4A–B). To assess whether this was due to TCR signal strength, we repeated the experiment with K562 aAPCs loaded with titrated ratios of activating and isotype antibodies. The aAPCs did not induce proliferation when loaded with 0% anti-CD3 (100% isotype), whereas 10% and 50% anti-CD3 induced incrementally more proliferation, with a plateau from 50% to 100% anti-CD3 (Supplemental Figure 5A). In all cases, the proliferation of transduced cells was similar to their internal controls (Supplemental Figure 5B). Similar results were found when CD4 was included in the activation signal to allow for LYP-LCK interactions (Supplemental Figure 5C–D). This suggests that optimized signal strength, as well as fluid membrane interface are not sufficient to recapitulate the differential inhibition of proliferation by the two LYP variants, and that other factors supplied by natural APCs (e.g., adhesion molecules, soluble factors, and/or co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory ligand and downstream signaling interactions) may be required.\n\nOverexpression of PTPN22 influences T cell cytokine production.\n\nCD4+ effector T cells modulate host immune responses after encountering cognate antigens, in part, through the production of an array of cytokines. Thus, we sought to assess the impact of LYP variant expression on the secretion of cytokines important in driving Th1 and Th2-associated immunity. Sorted transduced Tconv cells were activated with APCs, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28, and culture supernatants were assayed for cytokines over a 72-hour time period. The net accumulation of IL-2 in this system is a function of activation-induced secretion and of consumption via the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) because the high-affinity component, CD25, is dramatically upregulated in this time period (Supplemental Figure 4). We found that the net accumulation of IL-2 was not altered by overexpression of the LYP-620R variant, but was increased at the 24-hour time point by the LYP-620W variant (Figure 5A). The secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 was robustly inhibited for the first 48 hours by expression of either LYP variant. At the72-hour time point, inhibition occurred to a somewhat lesser degree by LYP-620W, thought this difference was not significant between variants (Figure 5B–F). Finally, and somewhat surprisingly given the documented Th1 signature implicated in several of the autoimmune disorders that are associated with the rs2476601 risk variant, IFNγ secretion was not altered by overexpression of either variant of LYP (",

Finally, and somewhat surprisingly given the documented Th1 signature implicated in several of the autoimmune disorders that are associated with the rs2476601 risk variant, IFNγ secretion was not altered by overexpression of either variant of LYP (Figure 5G). This result is in agreement with studies of Ptpn22 knockout mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both LYP variants result in similar levels of effector cytokine secretion.\n\nTreg-mediated suppression is altered by overexpressed PTPN22.\n\nOur data demonstrated that PTPN22 is more highly expressed in Treg as compared to Tconv (Figure 1A). We therefore hypothesized that the PTPN22 risk variant may influence disease risk by altering Treg-mediated suppression. Hence, we assessed whether transduced Treg were deficient in their suppressive capacity and whether transduced Tconv were refractory to Treg suppression. In order to determine the effect of overexpressed LYP variants on Tresp, irradiated autologous APCs and titered amounts of Treg were co-cultured with transduced Tconv (eGFP+) and mock-transduced (eGFP-) internal control Tconv. We found that, similar to our previous results (Figure 4A), overexpressed LYP-620R significantly repressed Tresp proliferation while repression by LYP-620W was dramatically reduced across the Treg:Tresp range (Figure 6A). However, the relative suppression of transduced Tresp did not differ significantly from their internal mock controls (Figure 6B). This suggests that the Tconv-intrinsic susceptibility conferred by LYP-620W is due to reduced control over activation, proliferation, and effector mechanisms, rather than a defect in the ability of effector cells to be suppressed by Treg.\n\nFinally, we assessed the effect of the LYP variants on Treg suppressive capacity by co-culturing titered amounts of sorted transduced (eGFP+) Treg with irradiated autologous APCs and untransduced Tresp. We found suppression by Tregs overexpressing LYP-620R to be similar to eGFP reporter Tregs, while suppression by Tregs expressing the risk LYP-620W variant was slightly increased (Figure 6C). Consistent with our previous result (Figure 4B), Treg proliferation in the suppression assay co-culture was similar for LYP-620R and LYP-620W (Figure 6D). This indicates that the difference in suppressive capacity was not due to differences in Treg proliferation, and suggests a Treg intrinsic impact of LYP-620W to enhance suppressive function.",

    "content": "Results\n\nTAG72-CAR T cells containing a 4-1BB intracellular co-stimulatory domain demonstrate in vitro activation against purified TAG72\n\nOur first goal was to develop a second-generation TAG72-BBζ CAR construct containing the humanized scFv CC49, the human IgG4 Fc extracellular spacer lacking a CH2 domain (ΔCH2), the CD4 transmembrane domain, the 4-1BB intracellular co-stimulatory domain, and the CD3ζ cytolytic domain followed by a truncated CD19 (CD19t) for cell tracking (Figure 1A). We selected this CAR construct based on our recent preclinical investigations demonstrating potent anti-tumor activity of 4-1BB-containing CARs for solid tumors. TAG72-BBζ CAR lentivirus was used to transduce human healthy donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells depleted of CD14+ and CD25+ cells (dPBMC), as previously described. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells were enriched during the manufacturing process (based on CD19t+ selection) and were stably expressed on the surface of T cells (Figure 1B). CAR T cells expanded ex vivo with similar kinetics and comparable CD4:CD8 ratios to Mock (untransduced) T cells (data not shown and Figure 1C). Importantly, and as a first measure of CAR T cell activation against TAG72, we demonstrated dose-dependent CD137 expression on the surface of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells when cultured with plate-bound, but not soluble, purified TAG72 (Figure 1D). Similar dose-dependent induction of cell-surface CD69 expression and IFNγ release was observed with plate-bound TAG72 (Supplemental Figures 1A,B).\n\nTAG72-BBζ CAR T cells effectively target ovarian cancer cells in vitro\n\nWe next sought to evaluate cell-surface TAG72 expression on human ovarian cancer cell lines, including SKOV3, OVCAR8, COV362.4, OVCAR3, OV90, as well as the TAG72+ colon cancer line, LS174T. Prior studies have demonstrated expression of TAG72 by immunohistochemistry of ovarian tumor patient samples and by western blotting of human ovarian cancer cell lines. By flow cytometry, TAG72 was expressed on OVCAR3 cells (approximately 42%) and to a greater extent on OV90 cells (approximately 90%), with very low levels detected on COV362.4 cells (Figure 2A). TAG72 was absent on SKOV3 and OVCAR8 cells. Immunofluorescence staining of tumor cells confirmed TAG72 expression and cellular localization on the cell surface as well as intracellularly (data not shown). Importantly, we observed higher expression of TAG72 on OVCAR3 and OV90 cells harvested from the ascites of tumor-bearing animals as compared to in vitro cultured cells (Supplemental Figure 2).\n\nTo assess antigen-dependent activity of our TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells, we performed co-cultured assays with TAG72-positive and -negative ovarian tumor targets at an E:T ratio between 1:1 and 1:2 to determine their killing potential. After 24 h, antigen-specific T cell-mediated killing activity was evident with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells relative to Mock T cells (Figure 2B). Amongst TAG72-expressing targets, an average of 59% LS174T, 79% OVCAR3, and 67% OV90 cells were killed. After 72 h, killing of the same tumor lines increased to 77, 90, and 97%, respectively. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells showed minimal killing of TAG72-negative or low expressing SKOV3, OVCAR8, and COV362.4 cells. We further demonstrated the specificity of our TAG72-CAR T cells using a previously described CAR targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) with the same CAR design (Supplemental Figure 3). At 72 h, we observed TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell expansion (2–3 fold) against TAG72-positive tumor cells (Figure 2C). Similar tumor killing was observed at lower E:T ratios of 1:10 (data not shown), demonstrating the potent killing ability of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells. TAG72 is shed from tumor cells in a soluble form, which we showed minimally impacted the tumor killing ability of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (Supplemental Figure 4). We then evaluated cytokine production from CAR T cells as an additional measure of T cell activity. IFNγ and IL-2 cytokine production was observed only when TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells were co-cultured with antigen-positive tumor targets, OVCAR3, LS174T, and OV90 (Figures 2D,E). While IL-2 production peaked at early time points (24 h) and was detectable only against OVCAR3 at later time points (72 h), IFNγ levels were more sustained over 72 h.\n\nTAG72-BBζ CAR T cells target TAG72-positive cells from ovarian cancer ascites in vitro\n\nTo further confirm TAG72 as an ovarian cancer CAR target and the anti-tumor activity of our TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells, we performed in vitro assays utilizing human ovarian cancer ascites from three patients (OAS3, OAS4, OAS7). Freshly thawed ascites from OAS3, OAS4, and OAS7 expressed 62, 80, and 67% TAG72, respectively, by flow cytometry (data not shown), but after 72 h in culture, was reduced to 2, 53, and 19%, respectively (Figure 2F), likely reflecting an influence",

We then evaluated the cytolytic activity of CAR T cells after 72 h of co-culture with freshly thawed patient primary ovarian cancer ascites, and showed potent and selective CAR-mediated killing of the TAG72-positive OAS4 and OAS7 cells, with no detectable anti-tumor activity against the TAG72-negative OAS3 cells (Figure 2G). TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells produced IFNγ and IL-2 against OAS4, but not OAS3 and OAS7 cells (Figure 2H, Supplemental Figure 5).\n\nRegional intraperitoneal delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells exhibits potent anti-tumor activity and extends survival in ovarian ascites-bearing mice\n\nTo evaluate the therapeutic potential of our TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in vivo, we first established TAG72+ OVCAR3 tumors in immune compromised NSG mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, to mimic peritoneal ovarian tumors observed in late-stage human disease. OVCAR3 cells were lentivirally transduced to express eGFP/ffluc to allow for tracking of tumor growth via non-invasive optical imaging. At 14 days post-tumor i.p. injection, mice were treated with Mock or TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (5.0 × 106) by systemic intravenous (i.v.) or regional i.p. delivery (Figure 3A). We observed rapid anti-tumor effects in mice treated with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells via regional i.p. delivery, reaching a maximal anti-tumor response 1–2 weeks following treatment (Figures 3B,C). In comparison to regional delivery, i.v. delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells showed limited anti-tumor responses. Anti-tumor responses in mice were durable for 3–4 weeks, but ultimately tumor recurrences were observed in mice. Regional i.p. delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells significantly extended survival of mice, with limited benefits observed by i.v. delivery (Figure 3D).\n\nTo address potential differences observed between i.p. and i.v. therapy, we measured CAR T cells in the blood and ascites of mice. Strikingly, appreciable numbers of CAR T cells (huCD45+CD19t+) were found in the blood of mice 6 days post i.p. treatment, with more than 5-fold fewer CAR T cells in the blood of i.v. treated mice at the same time point (Figure 3E, Supplemental Figure 6). However, we observed equivalent numbers of CAR T cells in the blood of i.p. and i.v. treated mice at later time points, expanding from 1 to 2 weeks, with significant reductions at 4 weeks post-treatment. We then evaluated CAR T cell presence in the ascites of treated mice, and observed CAR T cells at the site of tumors at day 6 post i.p. treatment, with no detectable CAR T cells in i.v. treated mice at the same time point. However, at day 13 post-treatment, similar levels of CAR T cells were observed in mice treated i.v. and i.p. (Figure 3F). These data suggest that CAR T cells eventually reached the tumor following i.v. delivery but with delayed kinetics compared with i.p. delivery, which was likely in part responsible for the lack of observed therapy by this route of administration. CD45-negative cells, likely majority being OVCAR3 tumor cells, were significantly depleted in i.p. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treated mice, but not i.p. or i.v. Mock T cell or i.v. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treated mice. These data support regional intraperitoneal delivery of TAG72-CAR T cells as an effective method of targeting peritoneal ovarian tumors in mice.\n\nRepeat treatment with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells controls tumor more effectively\n\nBased on our findings with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in OVCAR3-bearing mice, we next evaluated the OV90 i.p. model, with more uniform TAG72 expression in vitro compared with OVCAR3 (Figure 2A). We first confirmed effectiveness of regional CAR T cell delivery in this model and showed similarly to the OVCAR3 model, i.p., but not i.v. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treatment showed anti-tumor efficacy in the OV90 model (Supplemental Figure 7A). Overall survival was only delayed by approximately 25 days in this model with i.p. delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (Supplemental Figure 7B), likely owing to the aggressive nature of this model. We therefore evaluated whether repeat TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell dosing compared with a single dose improves therapeutic responses (Figure 4A). Compared with a single dose of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells, repeat dosing over the course of 1 month demonstrated more durable anti-tumor responses in the OV90 model (Figures 4B,C). When plotted as relative tumor growth kinetics, repeat dosing promoted more extensive tumor regression as well as more durable control of tumors compared with single dosing (Figure 4D).\n\nIn this study, the overall survival was",

When plotted as relative tumor growth kinetics, repeat dosing promoted more extensive tumor regression as well as more durable control of tumors compared with single dosing (Figure 4D).\n\nIn this study, the overall survival was extended significantly in mice that received repeat doses of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (55 day benefit) compared with a single dose (30 day benefit) (Figure 4E). Greater T cell numbers were observed in peritoneal tumors of mice with repeat treatment (Figure 4F). Importantly, however, we observed reduced numbers, expansion and persistence of CAR T cells in the blood of OV90-bearing mice, compared with the OVCAR3 model (Supplemental Figures 8A,B), suggesting that this more aggressive tumor model may also harbor suppressive mechanisms that hamper T cell function and overall CAR T cell efficacy. Collectively, these data demonstrate potent anti-tumor activity of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in ovarian cancer xenograft models, and also suggest that repeat dosing of regionally delivered CAR T cells may provide greater control of tumors compared with a single dose.\n\nTumor recurrences following TAG72-CAR T cell therapy show antigen escape\n\nOne of the major resistance mechanisms to CAR T cell therapy is the tumor antigen heterogeneity that exists in solid tumors that promotes eventual antigen loss or escape. While the loss of CAR T cells in our two models preceded tumor recurrences, we next evaluated expression of TAG72 in tumors from Mock and TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treated mice at various time points pre- and post- therapy. Since TAG72, MUC1, and MUC16 have all been identified as potential targets in ovarian cancer, we first assessed expression of these cell surface antigens on TAG72-negative OVCAR8, and TAG72-positive OVCAR3 and OV90 cells. OVCAR8 appeared to only express low levels of MUC1, and was absent for TAG72 and MUC16, while OVCAR3 expressed all three antigens at varying levels, and OV90 showed low expression of MUC1 and was absent for MUC16 (Figure 5A). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of these antigens in OVCAR3 tumors from mice treated with Mock or TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells. At 12 weeks post T cell infusion, tumors from Mock-treated mice showed heterogeneous expression of TAG72 (similar to flow cytometric analysis of the cell line), MUC16, and MUC1 (Figure 5B). However, tumor recurrences at early time points from mice treated with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells showed a dramatic reduction in TAG72 expression, while maintaining expression of MUC16 and MUC1. Similarly, repeat treatment of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in the OV90 tumor model also showed a reduction in TAG72 expression in early recurrent tumors following treatment (Figure 5C). Interestingly, the expression of TAG72 was detected at high levels in tumor recurrences at later time points, in solid tumors as well as in ascites (Figures 5C,D). We further confirmed this finding in vitro, showing that residual viable OVCAR3 tumor cells remaining after CAR T cell co-culture expressed lower TAG72, but showed typical TAG72 expression levels on tumor cells that grew out in the absence of CAR T cells (Figure 5E). Similar reductions in TAG72 expression were observed with OV90 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that antigen escape plays a key role in tumor recurrences following TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell therapy.",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nA total of 1,144 Hutterites (613 females, 53.6%) aged 6–89 years (mean ± SD, 30.6 ± 18.4 years) with both genome-wide genotyping and spirometry phenotypes were included in the GWAS (Table 1). These same data are shown for the non-asthmatic and asthmatic sample subsets in Table E2 in the Online Repository.\n\nHeritability of lung function in the Hutterites\n\nThe broad (H2) and narrow (h2) heritabilities of lung function measures in the Hutterites were h2 = H2 = 40.2% (SE 5.4%) for FEV1, h2 = 17.8% (SE 3.7%) and H2 = 70.4% (SE 11.2%) for FVC, and h2 = 22.1% (SE 8.0%) and H2 = 91.5% (SE 12.9%) for FEV1/FVC. These estimates indicate that 40.2%, 70.4%, and 91.5% of the phenotypic variances in FEV1, FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio, respectively, are attributable to genetic variation in the Hutterites. The heritabilities of FVC and FEV1/FVC included both additive and non-additive (i.e., dominance) genetic variance components, whereas the heritability of FEV1 was comprised entirely of additive genetic variance.\n\nGWAS of lung function traits\n\nWe identified genome-wide significant associations between FEV1/FVC and five SNPs at the THSD4-UACA-TLE3 locus on chromosome 15q23 (see Fig. E2a in the Online Repository), replicating results from previous GWAS. Overall, there were 21 SNPs at this locus with P < 10−5 (see Table E3 in the Online Repository). The most significant SNP at this locus, rs12441227, explained 2.9% of the residual variance in FEV1/FVC in the Hutterites. The evidence for association with SNPs at this locus remained when the individuals with asthma were excluded (Fig. E2d), and when the sample was stratified by age (Table E4).\n\nNine additional SNPs at four loci had P-values < 10−5 with FEV1/FVC, including SNPs downstream of the C10orf11 gene on chromosome 10q22.3, which was associated with FEV1 in a meta-analysis of lung function GWAS. When a sub-analysis was performed excluding the Hutterites with asthma, the evidence for association at this locus increased to genome-wide levels of significance (Table E4, Fig. E2f) The evidence for associations with SNPs at three of these loci with P-values < 10−5, CCL23-CCL18 on chromosome 17q12 (Fig. E2b and E2e), PITPNC1 locus on chromosome 17q24.2, and CHAF1B on chromosome 21q22.13, remained in sub-analyses excluding asthmatics. The evidence for association at all locus with P-values < 10−5 was present in subset analyses stratified by age (Table E4). Only two SNPs had P-values < 10−5 in the GWAS for the other two phenotypes: one SNP 7k downstream of the IL37 gene on chromosome 2q13 was associated with FEV1 and one SNP in an intron of ASXL3 on chromosome 18q12.1 was associated with FVC.\n\nThe Manhattan and Q-Q plots of P-values for the GWAS of the three phenotypes are shown in Fig. 1; results for all SNPs with P < 10−5 are shown in Table E3 in the Online Repository. The GWAS P-values in the Hutterites for the 27 loci associated with lung function in previous meta-analyses are shown in Table E5 in the Online Repository. Overall, we found nominal evidence (P < 0.05) of association with at least one of the three phenotypes for 14 SNPs at 9 of the 27 previously reported loci; and five SNPs at an additional five previously reported loci were associated with at least one of the three phenotypes at P < 0.01.\n\nMultimarker modeling\n\nWe assumed that there were additional true associations among the GWAS SNPs that did not reach genome-wide levels of significance because their effects are too small to detect in single SNP analyses, especially in a sample size of ~1,000 subjects. Therefore, to assess a multimarker model of risk including all SNPs with P < 10−3, we performed LASSO regression to identify minimum sets of SNPs that provided the smallest mean square error of FEV1/FVC in the Hutterites. A set of 80 SNPs yielded the best predictive value and were used for further study (see Table E6 in the Online Repository).\n\nFirst, we assessed the phenotypic effects of these 80 SNPs by binning individuals by the total number of alleles associated with reduced FEV1/FVC that they carried (total possible = 160) and calculated the mean (SE) residual FEV1/FVC for Hutterites in each bin. The mean residual FEV1/FVC decreased with increasing number of ‘low FEV1/FVC alleles’, consistent with an additive genetic architecture (Fig. 2).\n\nNext, we used the GRAIL algorithm to mine the Gene Ontology database for evidence of functional connections between genes near the 80 predictive SNPs. We identified a subset",

Notably, the associated GWAS SNPs at two replicated loci, THSD4-UACA-TLE3 and C10orf11, were not functionally connected to any other genes defined by the 80 SNPs. However, a SNP at the CCL23-CCL18 locus, the second most significant locus in the Hutterite GWAS (see Fig. E3b in the Online Repository), was significantly connected to the β-defensin genes, as well as to CXCL12 and TNFRSF13B in the GRAIL analysis. These six SNPs by themselves explained 5.8% of the residual variance in FEV1/FVC in the Hutterites.",

As to CTLA4, the SNPs which were mostly consulted were rs231775, rs231725, rs3087243, and rs5742909. These SNPs were reported in 14, 6, 9, and 5 studies, respectively. The genotypes of controls were in line with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in most articles.\n\n4.2. Meta-Analysis\n\nObvious heterogeneity was identified in CTLA4 rs231775 polymorphism (G versus A: P(het) = 0.008, I2 = 54.1%; GG versus AA: P(het) = 0.032, I2 = 45.6%), rs3087243 polymorphism (GA versus GG: P(het) = 0.028, I2 = 53.5%; AA + GA versus GG: P(het) = 0.037, I2 = 51.2%), and rs5742909 polymorphism (T versus C: P(het) = 0.001, I2 = 69.4%; TC versus CC: P(het) = 0.01, I2 = 66.7%; and (TT + TC) versus CC: P(het) = 0.007, I2 = 69%). Therefore, we chose the random-effect model to generate extensive CIs in these genetic models, the rest of genetic models were used the fixed-effects model (Table 2).\n\nThe results of this analysis in the association of CTLA4 polymorphisms (rs231775, rs231725, rs3087243, and rs5742909) with susceptibility to PBC are presented (Table 3).\n\nThe study identified that rs231775 polymorphism of CTLA4 was significantly associated with PBC susceptibility. The ORs (95%CIs) of G versus A, GG versus AA, GA versus AA, (GG + GA) versus AA, and GG versus (AA + GA) were 1.32 (1.19–1.47), 1.72 (1.37–2.16), 1.27 (1.13–1.43), 1.38 (1.23–1.54), and 1.52 (1.35–1.71), respectively. As to each model, the p value was below 0.0001 (Figure 1). The rs231725 polymorphism also showed significant association with PBC susceptibility. The ORs with 95%CIs of A versus G, AA versus GG, GA versus GG, (AA + GA) versus GG, and AA versus (GG + GA) were 1.33 (1.22–1.45), 1.83 (1.52–2.21), 1.20 (1.04–1.38), 1.34 (1.17–1.53), and 1.57 (1.35–1.82), respectively. As to each genetic model, the p value was below 0.05 (Figure 2). Nevertheless, no association was identified between rs3087243 (Figure 3) and rs5742909 (Figure 4) polymorphisms and PBC susceptibility. Subgroup analysis showed that both rs231775 and rs231725 showed significant association with PBC susceptibility for Asians and for Caucasians.\n\n4.3. Calculation of Linkage Disequilibrium\n\nBased on the values of r2, there was no obviously linkage disequilibrium among four SNPs (Table 4).\n\n4.4. Sensitivity Analyses and Publication Bias\n\nSensitivity analysis was conducted by omitting each studies sequentially, suggesting that the results for the overall population were statistically stable and reliable (Figure 5). Publication bias was examined by using Egger's regression and Begg's funnel plot in our research. No obvious publication bias was identified. For Begg's test, p values of rs231775 (G versus A), rs231725 (A versus G), rs3087243 (A versus G), and rs5742909 (T versus C) were 0.661, 0.806, 0.466, and 0.060, respectively. For Egger's test, p values of genetic models mentioned above were 0.952, 0.186, 0.061, and 0.029, respectively (Figure 6).",

    "content": "Results\n\nGenetic control of gene expression in T cells\n\nWe purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 313 healthy European individuals from the Estonian Biobank. The purified cells were subjected to genome-wide gene expression analysis, genotyping and imputation using the 1000 Genomes reference panel. After stringent quality control and filtering, close to 6 million SNPs, and expression data from 38,839 probes within 23,704 genes were included in the analysis. DNA methylation of 450,000 CpG sites was determined in the same purified cells of 100 of the individuals to add explanations to observed differential expression between cell types.\n\nTo characterize the extent of genetic control of gene expression in T cells and its cellular specificity, we first tested the association between SNPs and gene expression within 1Mb intervals, referred to as cis-eQTLs. In total, we identified cis regulatory SNPs for 2,605 genes in CD4+ T cells and 2,056 genes in CD8+ T cells at probe-level false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 (Fig 1A, S1 Table), with an overlap of 1,637 genes and estimated replication rate π1 = 0.99. The high replication rate reflects the similarity of the two cell types compared, and also highlights the limitations of arbitrary cut-off levels for significance. Moreover, about half of the significant eQTLs detected in a large meta-analysis of peripheral blood from 5000 individuals could be replicated in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (π1 = 0.51 and 0.45, respectively, S1 Fig), indicating a high level of T cell-specific eQTL effects. As examples of cis-eQTLs in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we observed evidence of genetic regulation of long coding RNA RP11−534L20.5 located 7 kb downstream of the IKBKE gene which has an essential role in regulating inflammatory responses to viral infections; STAT6, a transcriptional activator involved in T cell differentiation, and STX2 (syntaxin 2), involved in intracellular transport of vesicles (Fig 1B).\n\nCell type-specificity of eQTLs\n\nWe next used a Bayesian model averaging and hierarchical modelling that combines information across genes to jointly call eQTLs in one framework to assess the specificity and proportion of shared eQTLs in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Of 3871 genes associated with eQTLs, all showed very strong posterior probability to be shared between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (S2 Table).\n\nOne of the strengths of the multi-tissue joint cis-eQTL analysis is its capability to account for incomplete power. As our sample size for both of the cell types was similar, we noted the advantage of Bayesian methods in particular for genes with eQTLs that have modest effects. Moreover, for eQTLs where the absolute effect size was higher in one cell type, there was also a tendency for higher expression levels in that gene in the given cell type (chi-square test P-value < 2x10-16, S2 Fig). For a standard tissue-by-tissue analysis, higher effect sizes and small standard deviations lead to more statistical evidence against the null, thus resulting in lower P-values.\n\nThe effect of the magnitude of the expression levels is exemplified by the effect sizes and P-values of the probes in the inhibitory immune checkpoint gene, CTLA4, known to be associated with T1D and other endocrine autoimmune diseases. CTLA4 is covered by three probes all showing consistent eQTL effects shared by both cell types in the multi-tissue analysis (Fig 2A). In the tissue-by-tissue analysis, expression levels of CTLA4 were associated with 122 SNPs (S3A Fig), including T1D and RA-associated variants rs231775 (+49A/G), rs3087243 (CT60A/G), rs231806 (MH30C/G), and rs231735 (pair-wise r2 between the SNPs ranging from 0.51 to 0.90, and strong linkage disequilibrium (LD, r2 > 0.8) between MH30 and CT60, S3C Fig). The CT60 polymorphism is also in strong LD with length variation of the (AT)n repeat in the 3’UTR of CTLA4 with long variants of the repeat associating with lower CTLA4 mRNA expression in autoimmune T cell clones. Our results extend this finding to the polyclonal population of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, where the disease risk alleles were associated with lower expression levels of CTLA4 (S3B Fig). Genetic control of the expression of the alternatively spliced third exon, that is omitted from the secretory variant of CTLA4, was significantly detectable in CD4+ T cells only, whereas genetic association with the expression of the fourth exon was significant in both cell types (Fig 2B and 2E). Further investigation of the CTLA4 gene locus revealed differential methylation between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig 2C). Specifically, methylation of a CpG site near the second exon of CTLA4 (cg26091609) was inversely correlated with the expression levels of the three different probes in the gene (Fig 2D), possibly explaining the expression differences in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and thus failing to detect significant eQTL effects in the tissue-by-tissue analysis.\n\nInterestingly, divergent DNA methylation between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was similarly detectable for an additional 73 out of 187 genes covered by more than one",

Among the 74 genes, multi-tissue analysis resulted in the identification of eQTL effects for two or more probes in 66 genes which were shared between the cell types. These observations suggest that the differential splicing effects, plausibly regulated by epigenetic DNA methylation, influence the gene expression levels, and thus the power to significantly detect eQTLs in the tissue-by-tissue analysis.\n\nT cell specific trans-acting regulatory locus\n\nFor the analysis of SNPs affecting the expression of distal genes (>5 Mb apart), referred to as trans-eQTLs, we selected all 4,638 genome-wide significant (P-value < 5x10-8) SNPs from the GWAS catalog (accessed 24/03/2015). After correcting gene expression levels for cis-eQTL effects, we identified 36 and 40 GWAS SNPs associated with the expression levels of 209 and 378 distant genes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively (overlap of 21 SNPs and 133 genes; Fig 3A, S4 Table). The functions of the genes associated with the trans-acting GWAS SNPs highlighted their role in T1D (Ingenuity pathway analysis, P = 4.39x10-5, Fig 3A) and mTOR signaling (P = 3.84x10-3, Fig 3A) in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively.\n\nStrikingly, we observed a trans-acting regulatory locus at chr12q13.2 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with broad-range impact on hundreds of genes. Five SNPs in that region were previously implicated in B cell-specific trans-associations by Fairfax et al.. In T cells, we identified the lead SNP in this region as rs1131017 located in the 5´UTR of the ribosomal small subunit protein RPS26 gene (S5 Table). The rs1131017 SNP is in LD with eight GWAS SNPs implicated in T1D, vitiligo and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The pair-wise r2 values of the nine SNPs are shown in S4B Fig and their eQTL effects in S4C Fig, illustrating the strong LD (r2 > 0.8) between the top trans-eQTL SNP rs1131017 and several of the GWAS SNPs. In addition to RPS26, the trans-acting region contains the CDK2, RAB5B, SUOX, IKZF4 and ERBB3 genes (S4A Fig) and associates with the expression levels of 187 and 351 genes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, with an overlap of 124 genes (Fig 3B). Many of these genes are highly expressed and have specific roles in T cells such as CTLA4, GZMA, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY and CD8A (Fig 3B).\n\nMissense variant in IL27 as a candidate disease variant for T1D revealing significant trans-eQTL effects in CD4+ T cells\n\nWe also identified a trans-eQTL (GWAS SNP rs4788084[T]) on chr16p11.2 close to the IL27 gene associated with lower expression of IRF1 (P = 1.84x10-9) and STAT1 (P = 2.91x10-8) in CD4+ T cells only. The rs4788084[T] is associated with lower expression of STAT1 in peripheral blood and reduced risk for T1D. To further explore the effects of genetic variants in the IL27 region, we mapped trans-eQTLs for all SNPs in the chromosome 16:28,2–29,1 Mb region (829 SNPs in total, S6 Table, Fig 4A).\n\nThis analysis revealed an even stronger trans-eQTL signal for a missense SNP rs181206[G] within the IL27 gene (Fig 4B) and decreased expression levels of IRF1, STAT1 and REC8 (Fig 4C). The rs181206[G] allele, with a minor allele frequency of 29% in the 1000 Genomes phase 3 European population, causes the amino acid Leu119Pro change in the alpha-helical domain of IL-27 (S5 Fig). Strong LD (r2 ranges from 0.62 in the Estonian population to 0.84 in the other European populations, 1000 Genomes phase 3) between rs181206 and the GWAS SNP rs4788084 supports the protective role of the rs181206[G] allele for T1D among individuals of European ancestry. Of note, the effect of the missense SNP on IRF1 and STAT1 remains after regressing out the effect of the GWAS SNP, but not the other way around. Moreover, Bayesian test for colocalisation adds strength to the hypothesis that T1D susceptibility and changes of expression in IRF1 and STAT1 are associated with the region, and share a single causal variant with the most posterior support for rs181206[G] (S7 Table).\n\nImportantly,",

We also confirmed the absence of the signal in B cells and monocytes by re-analyzing the data from Fairfax et al. (S6 Fig). Notably, the trans-eQTL locus had no effects on the expression level of IL27 in cis (S7 Fig). In agreement with the cell type-specific effect, we found higher expression levels of the IL27RA and IL6ST (gp130) genes, which together act as a receptor for the IL-27 cytokine, in CD4+ cells in comparison to CD8+ T cells (Fig 4D).\n\nGiven the strong positive correlation between the expression levels of IRF1 and STAT1, we used structural equation modeling to determine whether the IL27 SNP rs181206 affects both genes independently or via each other. Overall, the best-fitting scenario suggested IRF1 to mediate the SNP and STAT1 relationship (model 1, S8 Table). The finding was supported by a simulation experiment (S8 Fig) and suggested a mechanism for the effect of IL-27 on IRF1 and STAT1 expression (S9 Fig).\n\nFunctional effects of the IL27 missense SNP suggest causal role in decreased expression of IRF1 and STAT1\n\nIn order to confirm the functional effect of the IL27 rs181206[G] allele we investigated its effect on IRF1 and STAT1 expression in human PBMCs by additional experiments. IL-27 is produced by innate immune cells, and after forming a heterodimer with EBI3, it interacts with its receptor IL27RA and activates the STAT1/STAT3 pathway in T cells. After binding to interferon stimulated response elements (ISRE), the STAT1/STAT3 pathway induces transcription of several interferon-induced genes, including IRF1 and STAT1 itself. We cloned cDNA variants of the IL-27 wild-type (Leu119) and missense (Pro119), as well as EBI3. After transfection into HEK293 cells, we combined the cell supernatants containing either IL-27 Leu119 or Pro119 protein with an equal amount of EBI3 protein and studied their effect on IRF1 and STAT1 expression by real-time PCR in human PBMCs from four healthy individuals.\n\nAs shown in Fig 4E, the missense SNP resulting in Pro119 in IL-27 induced lower STAT1 and IRF1 transcript levels compared to IL-27 Leu119. The comparison of the fixed effects of the rs181206[G] allele resulted in highly significant estimates:  = -1.11 (P = 5.52x10-13) for IRF1 and  = -1.28 (P = 4.86x10-10) for STAT1. This result supports our trans-eQTL analysis, suggesting that the Pro119 in the IL27 gene is the causal SNP of these associations.",

The IL-8 serum levels were significantly higher in patient (48.82 ± 27.36 pg/ml) than in control (10.67 ± 4.62 pg/ml; P < 0.0001) group (Fig. 1a). \n\nNo significant difference in PBMC composition between patients with asthma and healthy controls was claimed.\n\nWe found that the IL-8 serum concentrations were markedly elevated in children with moderate and severe asthma (n = 81; 71.55 ± 21.09 pg/ml) than those with mild form (n = 89; 28.55 ± 21.14 pg/ml, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2a). \n\nWe also reported in Fig. 1b, a significantly higher IL-8 mRNA levels in patients than in controls (P = 0.004). IL-8 mRNA levels were further increased in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma compared to mild asthma group (P = 0.025) (Fig. 2b).\n\nHowever, the IL-8 mRNA expression and the distribution of protein levels, according to different IL-8 genotypes for both polymorphisms did not differ significantly in the asthmatic group (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nGenotype Analysis of IL-8 Gene\n\nThe distribution of rs4073 and rs2227306 genotype frequencies for healthy controls and patients with asthma was in agreement with HWE (data not shown).\n\nWe observed a significant difference in the genotype and allele distributions of rs4073 and rs2227306 polymorphisms between asthmatic and healthy children (Table 2). \n\nFor the rs4073, the homozygous TT genotype was more frequent in asthmatic than in control groups (P = 0.002). The presence of this genotype was significantly associated with an increased asthma risk (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.28–2.48). Then, the presence of the rs4073 T allele is considered as a risk factor for asthma development.\n\nThe allele and genotype frequencies of rs2227306 were also significantly different between case and control groups, which suggest that the rs2227306 was associated with asthma susceptibility. Our results indicated that the subjects carrying CC or CT genotypes were more exposed to develop asthma compared to those carrying the TT genotype (OR > 2; P = 0.036).\n\nWe also analyzed the association of these polymorphisms with atopy. The frequency of the rs4073 TT and rs2227306 CC genotypes differed significantly between children with atopic asthma and healthy controls (P = 0.005 and P = 0.02, respectively). The presence of the rs4073 TT (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.25–2.65) or the rs2227306 CC (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14–2.47) genotypes was associated with an increased risk to develop atopic asthma (Table 3). \n\nSubject with at least one copy of rs4073 T allele had more risk to be diagnosed with asthma disease at an advanced stage (P = 0.02; OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.12–13.29) (Supplementary Table 1). Then, the rs4073 T allele is considered as a risk factor for asthma severity in Tunisian children.\n\nHaplotype Frequencies of IL-8 Gene\n\nLD test between IL-8 polymorphisms was estimated by the value of D’ (0.151). The most frequent diplotype in our population was TC (42.6%), but no significant difference was shown between patients and controls (P > 0.05). Therefore, the frequency of the rare diplotype AT was significantly associated with low asthma childhood risk in our population (P C < 0.0004) (Supplementary Table 2).",

    "content": "Results\n\nMast Cell Development Is Not Affected by btk Mutations.\n\nFirst, we assessed the effects of btk null and xid mutations on several aspects of mast cell development and phenotype in vivo or in vitro. Mast cells in wt and btk null mouse ear skins were similar in their morphology and anatomical distribution (data not shown) and numbers: 125 ± 27.9/mm2 of dermis (129/C57BL F2) versus 123 ± 32.2/mm2 of dermis (btk null). The phenotypes of BMMCs were indistinguishable between wt (CBA/J) and xid (CBA/HCaN-xid/J) as well as between wt (129/C57BL F2) and btk null mice in their morphology when the cells were stained with May-Giemsa or with Alcian Blue (data not shown), and in numbers of IgE binding sites: (4.6 ± 1.2) × 104/cell (CBA/J) versus (3.7 ± 2.0) × 104/cell (CBA/HCaN-xid/J); (7.9 ± 2.4) × 104/cell (129/C57BL F2) versus (8.2 ± 2.9) × 104/ cell (btk null). The wt- and btk null–BMMCs were similar in the expression of various signaling proteins, including FcεRI β and γ subunits, Lyn, Syk, Grb2, Shc, Sos, H-Ras, PLC-γ1, SPY75 (= HS1), protein kinase C (PKC; α, βI, βII, δ, ε, η, θ, and ζ isoforms), ERK1/2, JNK1/2, p38, PAK65, SEK1, and c-Jun (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that either btk null or xid mutations apparently do not significantly interfere multiple aspects of mast cell development in vivo and in vitro.\n\nEffects of btk Mutations on Anaphylactic Reactions In Vivo.\n\nWe next tested the effects of the btk mutations on mast cell activation events induced by FcεRI cross-linking. Two types of PCA experiments were carried out. Mice primed by intradermal injection of anti-DNP IgE for 24 h were injected intravenously with antigen and Evans blue dye. Extravasation of Evans blue dye, due to increased blood vessel permeability as a result of PCA reactions, was quantified. The extravasation of Evans blue dye during the first 30 min of the PCA reactions, which is dependent mainly on histamine and serotonin released from activated mast cells, was slightly but significantly reduced at all the tested IgE doses in xid mice compared with wt mice (Fig. 1 A). To examine another type of PCA reaction, mice were sensitized with anti-DNP IgE 24 h before a solution of 0.75% dinitrofluorobenzene (hapten) was applied epicutaneously to the ear skin. xid mice exhibited little or no IgE/ antigen-specific edema, whereas wt mice exhibited a prominent response that was detectable 4 h or later after antigen stimulation (Fig. 1 B). This late reaction is known to be at least partly due to TNF-α secreted from activated mast cells. Indeed, injection into the PCA-inducing site of wt mice with a neutralizing antibody to TNF-α just before antigen application significantly suppressed the development of the edema associated with the late phase of the reaction, as measured 24 h after antigen stimulation (Fig. 1 C). Significant defects in both the early and late phases of PCA reactions were also observed in btk null mice (data not shown). \n\nEffects of btk Mutations on FcεRI-mediated Degranulation and Cytokine Secretion.\n\nTo investigate the cellular basis for the diminished PCA reactions in btk mutant mice, the capacities to degranulate and release histamine and to produce and secrete cytokines were compared between BMMCs derived from the wt mice and the xid (or btk null) mice. Consistent with the modest defect in the early phase of PCA reactions and the more striking defect in the later phase, xid-BMMCs showed relatively mild defects in FcεRI-elicited histamine release but more severe impairments in cytokine secretion compared with wt-BMMCs. Maximal histamine responses (70–80% of the cellular content) were similar between wt- and xid-BMMCs. However, xid-BMMCs exhibited a marked reduction in histamine release at suboptimal doses of antigen, and the sensitivity of xid-BMMCs to antigen stimulation was reduced by 3.8-fold compared with wt-BMMCs (ED50 = 4.4 ng/ml [wt] versus 17 ng/ml [xid], see Fig. 2 A). Btk null–BMMCs exhibited a somewhat more severe defect with a reduction in maximal histamine release in addition to reduced antigen sensitivity (Fig. 2 B). \n\nIn contrast to the relatively mild defect in histamine release, the differences in TNF-α secretion between the xid- and wt-BMMCs stimulated with an optimal concentration (30 ng/ml) of antigen ranged between 1:3.2 and 1:12 (a mean of 1:6.7, n = 5, see Fig. 2 C). FcεRI-stimulated secretion of IL-2, IL-6, and GM-CSF was also impaired to a similar extent in xid-BMMCs (Fig. 2 C and data not shown). Similarly reduced cytokine responses were observed in btk null cells (data not shown). Wt-, xid-, and b",

FcεRI-stimulated secretion of IL-2, IL-6, and GM-CSF was also impaired to a similar extent in xid-BMMCs (Fig. 2 C and data not shown). Similarly reduced cytokine responses were observed in btk null cells (data not shown). Wt-, xid-, and btk null–BMMCs secreted barely detectable amounts (<40 pg/ml) of IL-4 in response to an immunologic stimulation through FcεRI (data not shown). These results suggest that the abnormalities in the expression of PCA reactions in xid and btk null mice reflect the mildly reduced degranulation and markedly defective cytokine secretion exhibited by btk mutant mast cells upon FcεRI cross-linking.\n\nDefects in the Transcription of Cytokine Genes in btk Mutant Mast Cells.\n\nTo further characterize the defects in TNF-α production and secretion in xid-BMMCs, we analyzed levels of TNF-α mRNA and protein in xid- and corresponding wt-BMMCs. As revealed by Northern blotting (Fig. 3 A), in wt-BMMCs, TNF-α mRNA was almost undetectable before stimulation but increased dramatically within 1 h after FcεRI cross-linking and decreased within the next few hours. However, under the same conditions of stimulation, xid-BMMCs produced less than one fifth the amount of TNF-α mRNA at its peak. \n\nThe membrane-bound TNF-α precursor, which was barely detectable before stimulation, increased after FcεRI cross-linking and reached a plateau level by 2–3 h after stimulation in wt-BMMCs (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). However, stimulation of xid-BMMCs led to only a slight increase in membrane-bound TNF-α content. Cellular pulse and chase experiments with [35S]methionine showed that there was no significant difference in the intracellular stability of TNF-α protein between wt- and xid-BMMCs (data not shown).\n\nTaken together, these data suggest that Btk regulates TNF-α production at the transcriptional level. To test this possibility directly, we transfected BMMCs with luciferase reporter constructs under the control of TNF-α or IL-2 promoters. Transcription of both the TNF-α and IL-2 reporter constructs was strongly induced when wt-BMMCs were stimulated by FcεRI cross-linking. In btk null–BMMCs, the induced transcriptional activity of the TNF-α (−200)– luc construct was ∼50% of that in wt-BMMCs (Fig. 4 A). Induction of transcriptional activities of the IL-2 (−321)– luc construct was 4–5-fold less in btk null–BMMCs compared with its activity in wt cells (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were obtained when the transcriptional activity of the TNF-α and IL-2 constructs was assessed in xid- versus wt-BMMCs (data not shown). We then performed additional experiments to assess the specificity of the transcriptional regulation of cytokine genes by Btk. We found that btk null–sBMMCs that had been stably transfected with wt btk exhibited higher transcriptional activities of the IL-2 (−321)–luc, TNF-α (−200)–luc, and NFAT–luc constructs than the cells transfected with vector or kinase-dead (K430R) btk (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, all three cell populations exhibited similar low levels of activity for the NFκB and c-fos constructs (Fig. 4 B). \n\nThe NFAT family of transcription factors and AP-1 proteins play essential roles in the expression of the IL-2 and TNF-α genes. These results indicate that defects in the production/secretion of cytokines upon FcεRI cross-linking in btk mutant mast cells are due, at least in part, to the inefficient transcription of these genes and may involve the signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of NFAT and/or AP-1 (Jun–Fos or Jun– Jun dimers). This notion is consistent with our recent data that Btk regulates JNK, an activator of c-Jun.\n\nGene Transfer–mediated Enhancement of the Ability of btk Mutant Mast Cells to Secrete Cytokines and Degranulate.\n\nTo further investigate the relationship between btk mutations and impairment of mast cell functions, we measured cytokine production in btk mutant mast cells that had been reconstituted with Btk by stable or transient transfection. For most of these experiments, we used mast cells (sBMMCs) that had been expanded in the presence of both IL-3 and SCF. When xid-sBMMCs that had been transfected with wt btk cDNA were stimulated by FcεRI cross-linking, we observed a substantial enhancement of TNF-α–producing/ secretory ability as compared to that seen in xid-sBMMCs that had been transfected with neo vector alone, with xid or kinase-dead (K430R) mutant btk cDNAs, or with wt syk or wt lyn cDNAs (Fig. 5 A). Expression of the transfected genes at comparable levels was confirmed by increased immunoreactive Btk proteins in wt, xid, and K430R mutant btk–transfected cells (Fig. 5 D, left). Transfectants expressing the constitutively active Btk* protein with the E41K substitution exhibited somewhat higher levels of TNF-α secretion than did wt b",

Transfectants expressing the constitutively active Btk* protein with the E41K substitution exhibited somewhat higher levels of TNF-α secretion than did wt btk transfectants (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, none of the nontransfected or transfected sBMMCs secreted TNF-α without FcεRI stimulation (data not shown). Results similar to those shown for TNF-α secretion were also obtained when we tested the effects of transfection with wt versus various mutant btk cDNAs on the ability of FcεRI-stimulated xid-sBMMCs to secrete IL-2, IL-6, and GM-CSF (data not shown). \n\nWe next investigated btk null–sBMMCs transfectants, and in particular analyzed the domain requirements for Btk function in FcεRI-mediated cytokine production as opposed to degranulation. As shown in Fig. 5 B, transfection with wt btk cDNA greatly enhanced the ability of the cells to produce TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6, or GM-CSF in response to FcεRI-dependent activation, whereas compared with transfection with vector, transfection with kinase-dead (K430R) or SH2 mutant (R307K) btk cDNA had little or no effect. On the other hand, relatively low levels of protein expression for the product of the SH2 mutant (R307K) were detected in the stably transfected cells (Fig. 5 D, middle), indicating that the potential effects of this mutant btk in this system have not yet been adequately tested. Notably, transient transfection of btk null–sBMMCs with wt, but not kinase-dead, btk also restored cytokine gene transcriptional activities (data not shown). This finding provides further support for the conclusion that the results reflect the role of Btk in FcεRI signaling, not any role it might have in mast cell differentiation.\n\nNotably, two mutant Btk proteins appeared to be able to partially (for TNF-α, IL-2 and GM-CSF) or fully (for IL-6) normalize 24-h cytokine production with respect to that seen in cells that had been transfected with wt btk cDNA (Fig. 5 B). One of these, the P265L mutation in the SH3 domain, is equivalent to the function-negative mutation in the SH3 domain of sem-5. Therefore, this result suggests that at least partial FcεRI-dependent cytokine secretory function can be expressed in the absence of normal Btk SH3 function.\n\nThe other mutant btk cDNA that partially restored cytokine secretory ability in btk null–sBMMCs was xid (Fig. 5 B). This result may be related to the fact that levels of xid Btk protein in btk null–sBMMCs that had been transfected with xid btk cDNA were ∼20–30% greater than levels of wt Btk protein in the corresponding wt btk transfectants (by contrast, xid-BMMCs express only 1/5 to 1/3 the amount of Btk protein as do wt-BMMCs, data not shown). Thus, in comparison to xid-BMMCs, btk null–sBMMCs that had been transfected with xid btk cDNA greatly overexpress the xid Btk.\n\nWe previously noted (in Fig. 2) that the defect in FcεRI-dependent degranulation and histamine release exhibited by xid-BMMCs was less severe than that observed with btk null–BMMCs. Indeed, at optimal levels of FcεRI-dependent stimulation, xid-BMMCs gave a histamine release response that was indistinguishable from that of the corresponding wt-BMMCs (Fig. 2 A). We therefore examined the effect of transfection of btk null–sBMMCs with xid btk and other mutant btks, as opposed to wt btk, on degranulation (as assessed by histamine release) at optimal conditions of IgE sensitization and antigen challenge (Fig. 5 C). We found that the profound defect in the histamine release response of btk null–sBMMCs under these conditions was nearly fully restored by wt or xid btk cDNAs, was slightly enhanced by SH2 (R307K) or SH3 (P265L) mutant btk cDNAs, but was unaffected (relative to results obtained with vector alone) by the kinase-dead (K430R) mutant btk cDNA (Fig. 5 C).\n\nSince Emt is not only closely related to Btk but is activated upon FcεRI cross-linking, we also examined whether Emt might influence defects in cytokine production or degranulation in btk null–sBMMCs. We found that btk null–sBMMCs express endogenous Emt protein (Fig. 5 D). Moreover, the overexpression of wt Emt protein, but not kinase-dead (K390R) Emt protein, enhanced both FcεRI-dependent cytokine production (Fig. 5 B) and histamine release (Fig. 5 C) in btk null–sBMMCs. However, transfection of btk null–sBMMCs with wt emt did not restore either cytokine production or histamine release to levels observed in cells which had been transfected with wt b",

Existing schema from schema.org (https://schema.org/), which powers ~40% of all websites, was expanded to accommodate this biomedical data. This data can be accessed using one of Google Data Commons APIs (https://docs.datacommons.org/api/), which are powered by BigQuery; https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). The graph is accessible via the Data Commons browser (https://datacommons.org/) and documentation can be found on the browser (https://docs.datacommons.org/) and github (https://github.com/datacommonsorg).\n\nA major advantage of the Biomedical Data Commons is that it integrates data into a searchable format that can then be used to extract information on a subset of the graph at scale. For example, using the python API and SPARQL we were able to search a subset of the graph that we were interested in—Gene, GeneticVariant, and GeneGeneticVariantAssociation nodes and edges (Fig 1C, top panel)—and extract only Gene and Genetic Variants that were associated with each other in whole blood by GTEx (Fig 1C, bottom panel). Extracting data using the Data Commons python API is faster by one to four orders of magnitude depending on the query and requires code of lower cyclomatic complexity than the standard data scientist approach of cleaning and preparing the raw data to answer basic biomedical questions (Figs 1D and S2A).\n\nSNP Prioritization Pipeline integrates multidimensional ‘omics data to form gene regulatory networks and prioritize biological validation targets\n\nWe developed a pipeline that takes multiple data types—regulatory elements, genetic variants, genes, and three-dimensional chromatin structure—to build gene regulatory networks and prioritize genetic variants and genes for biological validation experiments (Fig 2). This pipeline is deployed using input genetic variants from a disease of interest and epigenomic data from a cell type of interest. The regulatory elements that contain genetic variants that are in close physical proximity to a linearly distal gene target based on the three-dimensional chromatin structure are associated with one another to form regulatory elements—genetic variant—gene trios following the first step of the pipeline. These are then used as input into the second step, which results in the output of gene regulatory network visualizations and a ranked list of genetic variants and genes that are prioritized by their level of connectivity in their local regulatory network. The output gene and genetic variant list generated by this pipeline can be used as input into BMDC to obtain additional information on these candidates and provide the user with a more comprehensive picture into their biomedical function.\n\nSNP Prioritization Pipeline identifies non-coding and tissue-specific variants\n\nA list of 267 previously published significant T1D GWAS variants and an additional 12,707 variants in linkage disequilibrium with these significant variants was compiled (S3 Fig). Genetic variants in regulatory elements—open chromatin regions or transcription factor binding sites—in GM12878 B-lymphocyte cells were associated with gene targets using three-dimensional chromatin conformation data defined by H3K27ac HiChIP (Fig 3A). This identified 602 unique genetic variants participating in 8,682 unique genetic variant—regulatory element—gene trios with 473 unique gene targets (S3 Fig). The vast majority of these output candidate variants are of unknown clinical significance as recorded by ClinVar (Fig 3B). The output candidate variants are also enriched for non-coding regions compared to the input genetic variants as defined by the genomic location recorded in dbGAP (Fig 3C). This is as expected because the pipeline filters for variants in defined regulatory elements. ~18% of output candidate variants have previously been significantly associated by GTEx with at least one of their assigned gene targets in pancreas, thyroid, or whole blood (S2B Fig). Information on the clinical significance, genome location, and known significant gene associations of genetic variants was identified using the BMDC python and SPARQL API (Figs 3B and 3C, and S2A and S2B).\n\nThe pipeline was also run using cell type-specific regulatory elements and three-dimensional connectome data from 1° Naive T, Th17, and Treg cells. Comparison of the output genetic variants from each of these cell types reveals that the candidate variants identified were cell-type specific (Fig 3E, left panel). However, the gene targets identified by the pipeline were largely the same between the GM12878, and 1° Naive T, Th17, and Treg cells (Fig 3E, right panel).\n\nKegg pathways and gene ontology terms were used to provide further insight into the biological role of the pipeline identified gene targets of the output candidate variants using GM12878 cell type-specific input data. One of the top KEGG pathways is T1D and other top KEGG pathways are other autoimmune diseases (Fig 3F). The top gene ontology biological processes involve regulation of cytokine signaling and T cells (S4C Fig).\n\nOutput candidate variants are common and not evolutionarily conserved\n\nUsing the BMDC python API, we observed the majority of output candidate variants identified by the pipeline (S3 Fig) to be common with a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 2% (Fig 3G). The providence for this data extracted from BMDC is dbGAP. The distribution of",

The top gene ontology biological processes involve regulation of cytokine signaling and T cells (S4C Fig).\n\nOutput candidate variants are common and not evolutionarily conserved\n\nUsing the BMDC python API, we observed the majority of output candidate variants identified by the pipeline (S3 Fig) to be common with a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 2% (Fig 3G). The providence for this data extracted from BMDC is dbGAP. The distribution of the minor allele frequency of output candidate variants was distinct for each ethnicity (S2D–S2H Fig). Of note, East Asians had a larger proportion of output candidate variants with a rare minor allele frequency of less than 2% compared to other ethnicities (S2G Fig). The vast majority of output candidate variants have low CADD scores, which are calculated largely using evolutionary conservation data alongside additional metrics (Fig 3H). This is suggestive that the variants are not evolutionarily conserved. The top transcription factor binding motifs in pipeline-identified regulatory elements are CTCF/Boris and NFkB (Fig 3I). Compared to the original input list of T1D-associated variants based on GWAS and linkage disequilibrium, there is an enrichment of output candidate variants in chr6 (Fig 3J). Chr6 contains the HLA locus that accounts for ~50% of the genetic contribution involved in early-onset T1D.\n\nUsing cohesin HiChIP data as input identifies a subset of the trios found using H3K27ac HiChIP input data\n\n92.1% of trios identified using cohesin HiChIP three-dimensional chromatin conformation data were also identified using H3K27ac HiChIP data in GM12878 cells (S4A Fig). However, cohesin HiChIP data identifies only a fraction (~8.4%) of the trios found using H3K27ac data. Gene Ontology Biological Processes and KEGG Pathways associated with output candidate variants identified using GM12878 cohesin HiChIP data are immune system-specific (S4B and S4C Fig). The top binding motifs in pipeline-identified regulatory elements with GM12878 cohesin HiChIP data are CTCF/Boris and NFkB—the same as in the pipeline-identified regulatory elements with GM12878 H3K27ac HiChIP data as input (S4D Fig). The proportion of output candidate variants that are a T1D GWAS significant variant versus a variant in linkage disequilibrium is slightly higher using cohesin HiChIP data (7.9%) compared to H3K27ac HiChIP data (3.5%; S4E Fig).\n\nComparison to existing genetic risk score method\n\nThe T1D GRS2 genetic risk score method uses 67 genetic variants and was developed on patient data. It has performed well particularly in the context of early-onset T1D. Our initial input list of T1D GWAS significant variants and those in linkage disequilibrium included 34/67 of the Sharp et al. variants. Of these 7 (~20.1%) were identified as significant using our prioritization pipeline with GM12878 input data. An additional 3 unique genetic variants were identified using 1° Naive or Th17 input data. Of note, rs3024505, whose gene target is IL19 and other nearby genes, was identified using input data from all three of these cell types. Numerous previous GWAS studies of autoimmune diseases have identified rs3024505 as significantly associated with multiple autoimmune diseases including T1D, inflammatory bowel disease, Behçet’s disease, and others. Furthermore, a number of the genetic variants identified in this study were nearby Sharp et al. variants and regulated the same gene targets including in the IL27 and UBASH3A loci (S5 Fig). In addition, 24/40 Sharp et al. gene targets were identified using our pipeline with GM12878 input data.\n\nThere are four clusters of gene regulatory network structures\n\nThe pipeline produced genetic variants—gene regulatory networks. This was done by representing genetic variants and their gene targets identified by the first part of the pipeline as a bipartite graph. This results in a graph composed of multiple components, each representing the gene regulatory networks at distinct loci. These graph components were converted to a matrix representation to enable machine learning on the gene regulatory networks. To identify if there were common network structures, K-means clustering was performed on the principal component analysis (PCA) of the gene regulatory networks. This identified four clusters representing distinct gene regulatory network structures (S6B and S6C Fig). The one that separated the most was a dense cluster populated only by the Major Histocompatibility Class II (MHC-II) locus (Dense; n = 1). Another cluster contained components in which each node only had a few connections to other nodes in the graph and did not contain an obvious focal point (Chain; n = 2). A third cluster had multiple obvious focal points (Multi-Focus; n = 9). The final cluster contained gene regulatory networks with simple structures that tended to have a single focal point (Simple; n = 27).\n\nCentrality analysis identifies HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 as top candidates\n\nCentrality, a measure of the important nodes of the graph, was used to identify key nodes in the gene regulatory networks to recommend for further biological investigation. Closeness centrality, a calculation of the sum length of the shortest path between that node and all nodes in the graph, created the best distribution of centrality scores compared to alternative centrality measures degree and betweenness centrality (S6A Fig). The top candidate gene regulatory network was the 2.2 Mbp MHC-II locus (Fig 4A). This",

Closeness centrality, a calculation of the sum length of the shortest path between that node and all nodes in the graph, created the best distribution of centrality scores compared to alternative centrality measures degree and betweenness centrality (S6A Fig). The top candidate gene regulatory network was the 2.2 Mbp MHC-II locus (Fig 4A). This was selected because it contained the first ranked genetic variant by closeness centrality score of the pipeline output list of ranked genetic variants and genes (S3 Table). Furthermore, it was the most dense gene regulatory network and contained the most connected genes (HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1) as well based on centrality score.\n\nThe top candidates within the HLA locus were HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1, which together form the haplotype DR4—one of two haplotypes with the strongest association with T1D (Figs 4B and S7A). These genes are strongly connected by chromatin folding associated with all types of investigated regulatory elements containing one or more T1D-associated genetic variants (Figs 4C and S7B). The top genetic variant is novel rs14004 and it serves as a major connection point between the highly connected 1 Mbp HLA locus and the region 1.2 Mbp upstream (Figs 4B and S7A).\n\nChromatin connectivity in HLA locus is B-lymphocyte-specific\n\nThe chromatin connectivity in the HLA locus between pipeline-identified candidate genetic variants and their gene targets is cell-type specific (Fig 4D and 4E). Only a limited number of these connections were observed in 1° Treg cells. The HLA-DQB1 transcription start site (TSS), HLA-DRB1 TSS, and rs14004 are all strongly connected with each other as well as rs9986640 (Fig 5A and 5B). rs14004 and rs9986640 are both located in BCL11A, RAD21, and STAT5 ChIP-seq binding sites (Fig 5A). rs14004 is additionally in a TCF3 binding site, and rs9986640 is additionally in a CTCF, PAX5, SMC3, and SPI1 binding sites. HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 are associated with 98 genetic variants by the pipeline (S4 Table). rs14004 is a common allele whereas rs9986640 is a rare alle (Fig 5C).\n\nIL2RA is identified as the top candidate for within its locus\n\nTo provide insight into how the pipeline performed at another well studied locus in the context of Type 1 Diabetes, we focused on the IL2RA locus. The pipeline identified the IL2RA as the top candidate within the locus by closeness centrality of its gene regulatory network (Fig 6A and 6B). IL2RA is strongly connected via chromatin folding to multiple types of regulatory elements containing T1D-associated genetic variants (Fig 6C). The connectivity within the IL2RA locus of between pipeline-identified genetic variants and gene targets is distinct between GM12878 and 1° Treg Cells (Fig 6D and 6E). The top genetic variant candidate in the IL2RA locus is rs61839660, which is located in a BCL11A, EBF1, IKZF1, MYB, PAX5, SPI1, and STAT5 ChIP-seq binding site (Figs 6B and 6C, and 7A). rs61839660 and IL2RA TSS are both connected with the novel variant rs198390 (Fig 7A and 7B). Both variants and the IL2RA TSS are also connected to the IL15RA TSS. rs61839660 is a rare allele, whereas rs198390 is a common allele (Fig 7C).\n\nIkaros family identified as candidates\n\nFinally, we performed a deeper dive into IKZF3 and IKZF1 to provide additional example gene regulatory networks produced by the SNP Prioritization Pipeline. These loci were chosen because they belong to the same transcription factor family and are known to be important in B-lymphocyte development with IKZF1 a critical transcription factor. They are also implicated in early-onset Type 1 Diabetes, but their mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we use the gene regulatory networks produced by the SNP Prioritization Pipeline to generate hypotheses regarding the mechanism by which genetic variance may disrupt gene expression in these loci and contribute to Type 1 Diabetes (S8A–S8C and S9A–S9C Figs). IKZF3 is in a much more dense and complex gene regulatory region than IKZF1 (S8B, S8C, S9B and S9C Figs). The chromatin connectivity between pipeline-identified genetic variants and their gene targets in both of these loci are B-lymphocyte specific with no such connectivity observed in 1° Treg cells, which is to be expected because IKZF1/3 are known to specifically function in B-lymphocytes (S8D, S8E, S9D and S9E Figs).",

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nPatients’ clinical and molecular features\n\nWe compiled a list of 58 RAG2-deficient patients from published manuscripts and unpublished sources. These patients were divided into 4 different groups based on their clinical and immunologic presentation and according to the diagnostic criteria of the Primary Immunodeficiency Treatment Consortium. In particular, 20 patients were given a diagnosis of T−B−SCID, 28 patients were given a diagnosis of OS, 7 patients were given a diagnosis of AS, and 3 patients were given a diagnosis of CID-G/AI (Table I).\n\nAnalysis of the distribution of RAG2 mutations by disease phenotype revealed that some mutations were observed in multiple patients with the same phenotype, such as p.G35A, which was reported in 4 patients with AS, and the p.C478Y mutation, which was detected in 3 patients with SCID. Moreover, 6 other mutations (G95R, K127X, M285R, G451A, W453R, and E480X) were identified in 2 patients each, with the same clinical phenotype (Fig 1). Missense mutations at residues G35, T215, and R229 were identified in 24 patients who presented with either SCID or OS, indicating that these mutations are associated with a severe but somewhat variable phenotype. Furthermore, missense mutations at residues R73 and M459 were reported in patients with either OS or AS. By contrast, other mutations (F62L, T77N, and G451A) were reported only in patients with CID-G/AI (Fig 1).\n\nDistribution and recombination activity of mutant RAG2 proteins\n\nAs a preliminary step to analyze the recombination activity of the RAG2 variants identified in the patients, we transduced murine Rag2−/− Abl pro-B cells with a vector encoding for either human or mouse WT RAG2 (WT-hRAG2 and WT-mRAG2) or with an empty vector and compared levels of GFP expression on treatment with STI-571 (Fig 2, A). As shown in Fig 2, B, similar levels of GFP expression were induced by hRAG2 and mRAG2, whereas no GFP expression was observed in cells transduced with an empty vector (Fig 2, B). Altogether, these data indicate that hWT-RAG2 can cooperate efficiently with mWT-RAG1 in mediating recombination.\n\nInitially, Rag2−/− Abl pro-B cells were transduced with vectors encoding for various RAG2 mutant proteins (C478Y, A456T, W416L, and G451A) that had been identified in patients with SCID, OS, OS, and CID-G/AI, respectively. As shown in Fig 2, B, no detectable levels of GFP expression were induced by the C478Y mutant protein, whereas the G451A mutant protein supported significant levels of GFP expression, although levels were lower than in the presence of hWT-RAG2. Finally, low but detectable levels of GFP expression were supported by the A456Tand W416L mutant proteins associated with OS (Fig 2, B).\n\nBased on these data, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the recombinase activity of 41 naturally occurring RAG2 mutations, including 31 for which no data of functional activity had been reported previously. Among the 41 mutations tested, 6 were nonsense mutations, and the remaining 35 were missense mutations. Both the nonsense and missense mutations were distributed broadly along the length of the hRAG2 protein (Fig 3, A, and Table II). A higher density of mutations was observed in the plant homology domain at the C-terminus of the molecule, where mutations affected 18% of the amino acids included in the region compared with 6% and 3% of the amino acids being targeted by mutations in the core and acidic regions of RAG2, respectively (Fig 3, B). Although the 6 nonsense mutations supported no or minimal levels of recombination (range, 0.1% to 2.9% of WT-hRAG2), variable levels of functional activity could be ascribed to the 35 missense mutations (mean, 25.2% [range, 0.2% to 109.1%] of WT-hRAG2; Fig 3, C). Overall, missense variants supported significantly greater recombination activity than nonsense variants (P < .01; Fig 3, C). Finally, no clear difference of functional activity was observed for mutations affecting the plant homology domain or other domains of the protein (Fig 3, D).\n\nInterestingly, among the 41 RAG2 variants tested, 4 (P253R, F386L, N474S, and M502V) showed levels of recombination activity comparable with that associated with hWT-RAG2 (Table II).\n\nFor all of the RAG2 variants tested, we reported their minor allele frequency (MAF) in the Genome Aggregation Consortium (gnomAD) database, which calculated the combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD)–PHRED score to predict deleteriousness and incorporated these data and the results of functional analysis of recombination activity in a scheme to assess pathogenicity according to guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. We reported in ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) all the variants studied here (see Table E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).\n\nCorrelation of the recombination activity of mutant RAG2 proteins with clinical phenotype\n\nOn excluding 3 patients whose RAG2 mutant proteins (P253R, N474S, and M502V) supported WT levels of recombination activity, we aimed to determine whether the",

As shown in Fig 4, mutations associated with SCID and OS allowed similar levels of recombination activity, which were significantly lower than those identified in patients with the AS and CID-G/AI phenotypes. Although only a few patients with CID-G/AI were included in this study, these data support the notion that genotype-phenotype correlation exists also for human RAG2 deficiency, as previously found for RAG1 deficiency.\n\nAnalysis of recombination activity of compound heterozygous RAG2 variants\n\nAmong the 58 patients, 16 were compound heterozygous for 15 distinct combinations involving a total of 21 distinct RAG2 variants (Table I). In several of these cases, the 2 RAG2 alleles supported markedly different levels of recombination activity, making it difficult to predict the net effect of the compound heterozygous RAG2 variants on V(D)J recombination.\n\nFurthermore, the RAG complex is expressed as a heterotetramer including 2 molecules each of RAG1 and RAG2, so that the simultaneous presence of 2 distinct RAG2 variants in the complex might have very different effects than 2 copies of each variant alone. To investigate this in greater detail, we generated bicistronic retroviral vectors expressing equimolar amounts of 2 distinct RAG2 cDNA variants and did this for 5 cases of compound heterozygous variants that had been identified in patients P2, P9, P12, P44, and P45 included in this study. In parallel, a bicistronic vector expressing 2 copies of hWT-RAG2 was also generated. Analysis of the recombination activity supported by the bicistronic vectors produced results that were not easily predictable based on the activity of each individual variant (Fig 5, A). For example, P44 was compound heterozygous for 2 variants (T251I and R229Q) that supported 67.2% and 8.9% WT recombination activity, respectively. The bicistronic vector including both variants allowed levels of recombination activity (63%) that were very similar to those of the allele with higher residual function. By contrast, P9 was compound heterozygous for the G35A and E437K variants, which supported 22.1% and 0.9% recombination activity, respectively, whereas the bicistronic vector expressing both of these variants yielded levels of recombination activity (3.9%) that were similar to the less functional allele.\n\nNext, we studied the richness and diversity of V-D-J rearrange ments introduced by the bicistronic vectors at the endogenous Igh locus in Rag2−/− v-Abl pro-B cells. As shown in Fig 5, B, there was a robust correlation between levels of recombination activity (as measured based on GFP expression) and the number of unique reads of Igh rearrangements obtained on introduction of bicistronic vectors expressing 2 copies of WTor mutant RAG2 protein. more detailed analysis of V-J rearrangements (Fig 5, C, and see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) showed that introduction of 2 copies of hWT-RAG2 into Rag2−/− v-Abl pro-B cells generated a very polyclonal pattern of rearrangements, and similar results were obtained with 2 other bicistronic vectors that contained either the M502Vor T215I variants. By contrast, a more restricted pattern of V-D-J rearrangements was detected on transduction with the other 3 bicistronic vectors (G451A-M459L, R39G-R229Q, and G35A-E437K). Furthermore, the repertoire of Igh rearrangements induced by these 3 vectors revealed reduced diversity (as shown by lower Shannon index) and higher clonality (as indicated by increased Simpson index; Fig 5, D).",

    "content": "5 Simulation Results\n\nThe empirical Type 1 error rates at the nominal level of α = 0.05 are given in Table ii. The kernel machine SNP-set test had an appropriate size for all the three kernels and all genes considered. As a benchmark, we also report the empirical Type 1 error rate for the single SNP-based min test, which also gave the correct size.\n\nFigure 1 plots the empirical power of the kernel machine SNP-set test (using the linear kernel) and the min test for the ASAH1 gene. The ASAH1 gene is on 8p22-p21.3 and consists of 86 HapMap SNPs and 14 typed SNPs on the Illumina HumanHap550 array. The SNP-set is formed by including only these 14 typed SNPs. In Figure 1, we allowed each of the 86 HapMap SNPs to be the true casual SNP one-at-a-time and computed the power of both the survival kernel machine SNP-set test and the min test. The ASAH1 gene region is made up of SNPs with a good correlation structure, in which the typed SNPs are typically in good LD with each other and with the causal SNPs. To understand better when the kernel machine method performs better than the min test, for each casual SNP, we calculated the median R2 (a commonly used LD measure) of the causal SNP with the typed SNPs using the program Haploview. From Figure 2, we can see that when the median R2 of the causal SNP with the typed SNPs is moderate, the kernel machine method always has higher power than the min test. Not surprisingly, when the median R2 of the causal SNP with the typed SNPs is low, both methods have low and comparable power at levels around the Type 1 error rate of 0.05. In Figure 3, we also plot the power of the IBS and weighted IBS kernel. The plot shows that even when the survival time is simulated assuming a linear model, a scenario where the linear kernel and min test are optimized, the IBS and weighted IBS kernel suffer from only a slight power loss.\n\nWe also investigated the conditions under which the min test has higher power than the kernel machine method using the NAT2 gene. NAT2 lies on 8p22 and has 22 HapMap SNPs and only 4 typed SNPs from the transcription start to end of the gene. The 4 typed SNPs are rs1390358, rs1112005, rs7832071 and rs1208 and are labeled as SNPs 7, 11, 13, 21 in Figure 4. The power of the kernel machine SNP-set test is higher than the min test for most SNPs. The power of the min test is higher than that of the kernel machine method at SNPs 2, 5, 9, 11, 20. A close examination of the LD plot will reveal that SNPs 2 (R2 = 0.83), 5 (R2 = 0.91), 9 (R2 = 0.99), 20 (R2 = 0.99) are in high LD with SNP 11 which is a typed SNP. Hence SNPs 2, 5, 9 and 20 will have similar results as SNP 11. Additionally, SNP 11 is also in weak LD with the remainder typed SNPs (R2 = 0.26 − 0.27). Hence when there is only a single true causal SNP that is typed and tested (or one in high LD with it is typed and tested) but not in LD with other typed SNPs, the min test might give higher power than the kernel machine method. However, such a setting is unlikely to happen frequently in an actual GWAS. In contrast, SNPs 7, 13 and 21 are in good LD with each other and when each of these SNPs are the true causal SNPs, the power of the kernel machine method is higher than the min test. For a much larger gene like FGFR2 (Figure 5), in regions of high LD, the kernel machine method again outperforms the min test. In regions of weak LD, the two methods have comparable power.\n\nTo illustrate how using MAF as weights in the weighted IBS kernel can upweight rare alleles, we present the empirical power for the HLA-B gene in Table iii. HLA-B gene is a part of a family of genes known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex and lies on 6p21.3. There are only 6 HapMap SNPs and 2 typed SNPs (rs1058026 and rs2523608) in the SNP-set. In Table iii, we simulated each of the 6 SNPs as the causal SNP. Since survival time was simulated by assuming a linear genetic effect, one would generally expect the power of the weighted IBS kernel to be no greater than that of the linear kernel, which corresponds to a Cox model with linear genetic effects of the SNPs. Of the two typed SNPs, rs1058026 and rs2523608, the former (0.118) has a lower MAF than the latter (0.478).

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nCharacteristics of study population\n\nOur study employed 436 metastatic melanoma patients (Table 1). Among these, 215 patients received anti-CTLA-4 (171 ipilimumab and 44 tremelimumab); 176 anti-PD-1 (17 nivolumab, 159 pembrolizumab) and 45 combination therapies (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1). For anti-CTLA-4, 150 samples were obtained from patients treated at NYULH; 50 at UCLA and 15 at MGH. For anti-PD-1, 77 samples were obtained from patients treated at NYULH, 84 at UCLA and 15 at MGH; while for combination therapy (anti-CTLA-4/antiPD-1), 34 samples were obtained from patients at NYULH and 11 at MGH (Table1). The overall median age at treatment was 62.85 years (range: 19-90.20). A larger proportion of our patients were males (67%), consistent with the sex distribution of metastatic melanoma. The response rate for combination therapy was the highest (76.74%). For anti-CTLA-4- treated patients, the overall response rate was 36.91 %, while anti-PD-1 had 52.04% response rate. Some statistically significant difference has been observed between treatment cohorts for age of treated patients (p=0.02) (Table 1). Therefore, in subsequent analyses the effect of SNPs on ICI efficacy was tested separately in anti-CTLA, anti-PD1 and combination-therapy treated cohorts.\n\nAnalysis of association of 25 autoimmune risk SNPs with response in anti-CTLA-4\n\nA total of 22 SNPs that passed QC (quality control) were tested for their association with response in 213 anti-CTLA-4 treated patients. Among those patients, 78 patients were responders (controls) and 135 were non-responders (cases) (Table 2). Both additive and recessive logistic regression models revealed several associations with response; however, none of these reached a level of statistical significance corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni adjustment (p<0.002) (supplementary Table S2), or a less stringent Holm-Bonferroni method. The most significant association with response in anti-CTLA-4-treated patients was found for rs1893217 under a dominant logistic model: our data showed that the carriers of at least one copy of a minor allele G (AG or GG) were 2.79 times more likely to be non-responders, compared to those with the homozygous reference genotype (AA) (95%CI= 1.36-5.73; p=0.005; Table 2). rs1893217 was mapped to the PTPN2 gene, and is associated with autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes (Supplementary Table S1). While this was the most significant association in the anti-CTLA-4 analysis, the statistical significance was marginal after adjustment for multiple testing by Bonferroni or Holm-Bonferroni methods (p-adjusted = 0.09). We also tested whether the association of rs1893217 with anti-CTLA-4 response was modified by age and sex and while the effect of rs1893217 was stronger in the younger age group (OR=6.43, 95% CI 1.7423.82), none of the interactions with age or sex was statistically significant (Figure S1).\n\nAnalysis of association of 25 autoimmune risk SNPs with response in anti-PD-1\n\nFor anti-PD-1 treatment, 24 SNPs passing QC were tested in 169 patients, of whom 88 were responders (controls) and 81 were non-responders (cases) (Table 2). An additive model revealed the most significant association with response for rs17388568 (OR=0.38; 95%CI=0.21-0.67; p=0.0008; Table 3; Full results in supplementary Table S2), significantly surpassing the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (p<0.002). Under the dominant regression model, consistent with the additive model, rs17388568 was found to have the strongest association with response (OR=0.26; 95%CI=0.12-0.53; p=0.0002; Table2), surpassing the Bonferroni multiple testing adjustment. In this analysis, carriers of at least one minor allele (GA or AA) of rs17388568 are 74% less likely to resist anti-PD-1 treatment, compared to those with GG genotype. rs17388568 was mapped to the genomic region containing IL2, ADAD1 and IL21, a locus previously associated with allergy, colitis and type 1 diabetes (Supplementary Table S1). The interaction analyses with age and sex for rs17388568 showed stronger effects in the younger female patients; yet, none of these associations was statistically significant (Figure S2).\n\nAnalysis of association of 25 autoimmune risk SNPs with response in combination therapy\n\nIn a cohort of 43 combination-therapy treated patients (N responders=controls=33, N non-responders=cases=10; Table2), none of the associations with the 23 SNPs tested reached statistical significance after adjustments for multiple testing with both the Bonferroni and Holm-Bonferroni methods (Full results Supplementary Table S2).

As both alleles are available for binding of the transcription factor, by comparing the binding at both alleles within a sample heterozygous for a given SNP, these samples provide a natural internally matched control, with improved control for batch effects and technical variability, since the only variable that has changed is the allele. Of the six MS risk SNPs (all previously identified as eQTLs in LCLs, with evidence implicating EBNA2 binding) investigated, EBNA2 was found to bind dependent on MS risk allele at five loci (Fig. 2, p < 0·05). It bound preferentially to the risk allele of two loci, TRAF3/RCOR1 (rs1258869, p < 0·05) and CD40 (rs1883832, p < 0·05); and the protective allele of three loci, TNFAIP8 locus (rs32658, p < 0·001), TNFRSF1A locus (rs180069, p < 0·05) and TBX6 (rs3809627, p < 0·05) (two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test performed for all comparisons).\n\nEBNA2-TAT inhibits the EBV latency III growth program\n\nWe next investigated EBNA2-TAT effects on the LCL EBV latency III growth program since we previously reported LCL proliferation is associated with expression of several MS risk genes. We performed a dose-response experiment to find the optimal concentration of EBNA2-TAT that inhibits EBNA2 transcriptional function and affects MS risk genes without excess cytotoxicity. We treated LCLs with increasing concentrations of EBNA2-TAT over 24 hr. LCL proliferation was reduced significantly by all concentrations tested with 50µM reducing LCL proliferation by 40% (Fig. 3a, p < 0·01), 100µM by approximately 50% (p < 0·001), and 200µM by over 50% (p < 0·001) (two-tailed paired t-test). The cell morphology was also affected by increasing concentrations of EBNA2-TAT (Fig. 3b). Expression of the EBNA2 regulated EBV gene LMP1 was reduced significantly by EBNA2-TAT at 50µM at 24 hr (Fig. 3c, p < 0·05). The reduction in LMP1 was greater at 24 hr than at 48 hr (Supplementary Fig. 1) (two-tailed paired t-test). Taken together, this indicates significant disruption of the EBV latency III growth program by EBNA2-TAT 50 μM at 24 hr, and therefore these treatment conditions were chosen for the subsequent experiments. The cellular uptake of EBNA2-TAT and its specific binding to the RBP-Jκ site on EBNA2 has been previously confirmed through fluorescein labelling and in vitro GST affinity assay, respectively. We confirmed the previously shown finding that treatment with a mutant peptide of EBNA2-TAT (with a 2 amino acid substitution) had no inhibitory effects on EBNA2 function, no effects on cell viability or growth or have any effect cell morphology (Supplementary Fig. 3) indicating that inhibition of the EBNA2 interaction with RBP-Jκ is responsible for the effects of the EBNA2-TAT.\n\nInhibition of EBNA2 alters MS risk gene expression in LCLs\n\nWe next treated our cohort of 35 LCLs with the optimum treatment of EBNA2-TAT (50 µM for 24 hr). Of the seven MS-associated genes tested, gene expression of five was significantly affected by EBNA2 inhibition (Fig. 4), TRAF3 (p < 0·05), CD40 (p < 0·001), CLECL1 (p <0·0001), TNFAIP8 (p < 0·001), and TNFRSF1A (p < 0·001) (two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). Expression of two genes was not affected by EBNA2-TAT treatment: TBX6 and RCOR1. The reduced risk gene expression on EBNA2 inhibition for CD40, CLECL1 and TNFAIP8 suggests this transcription factor increases expression of these risk genes in LCLs. Conversely, these data suggest EBNA2 inhibits expression of TNFSF1A and TRAF3 in LCLs.\n\nThe effect of EBNA2 inhibition and the six MS risk loci on EBV DNA Copy number in LCLs\n\nEBV DNA copy number is a stable phenotype in LCLs. We previously demonstrated that several MS risk SNPs and genes are associated with EBV DNA copy number. We assessed the EBV DNA copy number for untreated and EBNA2-TAT treated LCLs (n=35). The TNFAIP8 locus demonstrated a genotype effect on EBV DNA copy number in untreated LCLs (Supplementary Fig. 5, p < 0·05, Mann-Whitney U test), and this genotype effect was ablated upon EBNA2-TAT treatment.\n\nIs the EBNA2 effect on gene expression at MS risk loci dependent on genotype?\n\nSince EBNA2 was demonstrated to bind one allele more than the other, we expected that EBNA2 would alter the allelic association with expression compared to that found in B cells. This was true for TRAF3, CD40, TNFAIP8, TNFRSF1A, TBX6 and RCOR",

This was true for TRAF3, CD40, TNFAIP8, TNFRSF1A, TBX6 and RCOR1, but not CLECL1 (Fig. 5a). EBNA2 bound preferentially to the risk allele for TRAF3, and that allele had lower expression. It bound to the protective allele for CD40, TNFAIP8 and TNFRSF1A; and in each case that allele had relatively lower expression. However, from the effect of EBNA2-TAT inhibition on expression, we can deduce that EBNA2 increases the expression of CD40, CLECL1, and TNFAIP8; and decreases the expression of TRAF3 and TNFRSF1A. This suggests that while altering gene expression in one direction, it can alter the relative allelic expression in the same direction (TRAF3, TNFRSF1A) or in the alternate direction (CD40, TNFAIP8). The effect on expression due to EBNA2 preferential binding is the effect that would be expected to confer increased immune evasion if the EBNA2 binding is the basis for the increased MS risk.\n\nDoes the EBNA2 interaction with MS risk alleles increase host immune evasion?\n\nEBNA2 interacts with MS risk loci, dependent on genotype (Fig. 2). The direction of effect on risk gene expression can be inferred from the alteration in the relative allelic expression in LCLs compared to uninfected B cells (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 8). Each of these MS risk genes have putative functions in the EBV latency III program proximal to LMP1 and LMP2 signalling. On the basis of the inferred EBNA2 effect on expression and risk allele preference, we have postulated the effect of the EBNA2/risk gene interaction on the program, and so evasion of the host immune response (Fig. 5b). The effect of EBNA2/risk gene interaction is to increase gene expression (CLECL1, TNFAIP8, TNFRSF1A) or decrease expression (TRAF3, CD40, RCOR1), as described in Fig. 5b. In each case, there are plausible explanations for an enhanced EBNA2 function on the latency III infection cycle through its regulation of these risk genes.",

Starting with the BC1 (N2) generation, we applied simultaneous selection for the presence of two traits: TB-susceptible phenotype and Chromosome 17 markers of the I/St origin. At the generation N10-11, more than forty B6.I-H2 recombinant congenic strains on the B6 background carrying different, partly-overlapping genomic regions of the extended H2 j- haplotype (17 Chr: 8,44–65,34 Mb) were generated. Fig 1 displays the most informative B6.I strains whose pheno- and genotyping allowed us to narrow the region of interest to the interval 33,77–34,34Mb (a total of 0,57 Mb). Mice of all strains which inherited this region from I/St ancestors were significantly more susceptible to infection than those bearing B6 alleles as indicated by survival curves (Fig 2) and the dynamics of cachexia (S1 Fig). Fine mapping within this region was achieved by superposition: the resistant strain B6.I-249.1.16 carries H2 j alleles more proximal than the SNPs rs13482956 (17:33, 773331) whereas the strain B6.I-9.3.19.8 is susceptible although all distal genes starting with and including H2-Ea are of B6 origin (Fig 1). Being more susceptible than B6, all recombinant strains carrying the region 33, 77–34, 34Mb inherited from I/St were more resistant than their I/St ancestors, indicating the influence of B6 background genes on survival. This is further supported by the fact that the level of resistance was identical in parental B6 mice and in recombinant mice which inherited the identified H2 segment from B6 (Fig 2). According to http://www.ensembl.org, the identified region contains 36 protein-coding genes, most of which may have important immunological and regulatory functions.\n\nGenes in the identified region are highly polymorphic\n\nNo information was available about the genome sequence of I/St mice, so it was impossible to start searching for candidate genes by direct sequence comparison. Therefore, we cloned and sequenced the protein-coding regions of all 36 I/St-originated genes in the region (GenBank, accession numbers KJ650201-KJ650234). Table 1 displays all amino acid (AA) substitutions between H2 b and H2 j haplotypes, as judged from the cDNA sequencing data. As expected, the region appeared to be highly polymorphic: only seven genes (Zbtb22, H2-Ke2, B3galt4, Slc39a7, Brd2, H2-DMb2, H2-DMb1) displayed no allelic polymorphism for the two haplotypes.\n\nThe H2 segment under study contains numerous genes generally involved in immune response control, and for many of these genes evidence is available indicating their possible involvement in the control of TB infection. S1 Table briefly summarizes the data illustrating this point. In addition, alternative splicing isoforms for many I/St alleles in this region not annotated previously were revealed (see: GenBank, accession numbers KJ663713- KJ663725), making the general picture of genetic diversity even more complex. The rich deposit of polymorphic genes potentially influencing susceptibility to, and severity of, TB infection, as well as the potential contributions of both polymorphism and expression regulation of other genes in the region, justified further narrowing the interval by genetic recombination.\n\nFine genetic mapping: round 2\n\nTo search for new recombination events inside the region 33, 77–34, 34 Mb, we performed several crosses between novel recombinant and B6 mice. In particular, the F2 progeny of (B6.I-249.1.15 x B6) F1 mice was used to develop a new set of congenic strains. In two new recombinant strains, B6.I-249.1.15.100 (hereafter–B6.I-100) and B6.I-249.1.15.139 (hereafter–B6.I-139), standard genotyping identified the point of recombination between markers D17Mit21 and D17Mit22 (Fig 3A). Surprisingly, these strains demonstrated sharply contrasting TB phenotypes (Fig 3B). After aerosol challenge, B6.I-139 mice did not differ by survival time from parental B6 mice (mean survival time (MST) = 238.9 ± 13.41 and 249 ± 10.21 days, respectively, P > 0.5). B6.I-100 mice did not differ from the B6.I -249.1.15.46 strain (MST 152 ± 13.3 and 153 ± 10.97 days, respectively, P > 0.5), but did differ significantly from the B6.I-139 strain (P < 0.001). Phenotypic differences were confirmed by evaluation of cachexia dynamics (S2 Fig), and by assessment of mycobacterial loads in the lungs at weeks 4 and 10 post-challenge (Fig 3C). Annotation in the http://www.ensembl.org database provides the length of 98, 588bp for the genomic region between D17Mit21 and D17Mit22, which contains only 5 protein-coding genes, 2 lincRNA genes and no genes for micro-RNAs (Fig 3D).\n\nB6.I-100 and B6",

Both strains carried the b allele of H2-Ob and the j allele of H2-Aa, but differed at the H2-Ab1 gene (Fig 4). The H2-Ab1 gene in both strains originated from recombination events between b and j haplotypes, but the crossing-over occurred at different sites. In B6.I-139 mice, the whole polymorphic part of the H2-Ab1 gene encoding the extracellular functional domain of the molecule was of the H2 b origin: only substitutions W222R in the connecting peptide and H249Y in the cytoplasmic domain were inherited from the H2 j haplotype. In contrast, in B6.I-100 mice this polymorphic part of the H2-Ab1 gene was identical with that of the H2 j haplotype, except for a single substitution N29D (Fig 4). As far as both recombination events occurred in the translated part of the gene, we assume that the promoter region of B6 origin was identical for both strains and played no role in infection response. The fact that B6.I-139 mice displayed the resistant phenotype similar to parental B6 mice suggests that two AA substitutions of I/St origin in the connecting peptide and the cytoplasmic domain are not major players in TB susceptibility. Analogously, the presence of the H2 b-encoded aspartic acid in the H2-Ab1 of the B6.I-100 strain is unlikely to influence the level of TB susceptibility, since B6-I.100 mice display a phenotype identical to that of B6.I-249.1.15.46 mice, whose entire H2-Ab1 gene was inherited from I/St mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the differences in TB susceptibility/severity between these two recombinant mouse strains were determined by allelic polymorphisms in a single β1 domain of the H2-Aβ molecule.\n\nThus, independent recombination events within a single gene created genetic variation sufficient to markedly alter the response to TB infection. The newly identified H2-Ab1 alleles were designated as j* in the B6.I-100 strain and b* in the B6.I-139 strain.\n\nParameters of infection regulated by the H2-Ab1 alleles\n\nWe performed fine genetic mapping using the most integrative TB characteristics–survival curves, mycobacterial multiplication in the lungs, and body weight loss. Differences in the regulation of lung tissue inflammation after infection in B6 and I/St mice are of critical importance for TB pathogenesis. To characterize the influence of the H2-Ab1 polymorphism on TB-induced inflammation, we compared lung pathology 35 days post-infection in mice of both parental and new recombinant strains. As shown in Fig 5A, in B6 and B6.I-139 mice, lung pathology was represented by granulomatous areas well-delimited from the breathing tissue, whereas I/St and B6.I-100 mice developed diffuse TB pneumonia that was more severe in I/St mice.\n\nIn good agreement with the histological results, the levels of key Type 1 inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α, after TB challenge were significantly lower in the lungs of resistant B6 and B6.I-139 mice compared to susceptible I/St and B6.I-100 mice (Fig 5B). No difference in the levels of the TB-irrelevant Type 2 cytokine IL-5 between all four strains was found. Importantly, production of the key TB-protective Type 1 cytokine, IFN-γ, by CD4+ T-lymphocytes isolated from the lungs of infected mice and stimulated in vitro with a mixture of mycobacterial antigens followed the H2-Ab1-determined pattern. As shown in Fig 5C, the 5-fold difference in the numbers of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells between parental B6 and I/St strains was reduced to a 2-fold difference between B6.I-139 and B6.I-100 mice but remained highly significant (P < 0.01). Calculation of the total numbers of IFN-γ-producing CD4 cells per lung provided the results consistent with the percentile evaluation (S2 Table). These results establish connections between anti-TB protective immune responses, CD4+ T-cell function and allelic heterogeneity of the classical Class II antigen-presenting molecule, providing a mechanistic explanation for the differences in the severity of disease determined by a single MHC gene.\n\nCD4+ T cell response to mycobacterial antigens develops in the context of the H2-A molecule\n\nIFN-γ production by the CD4+ T cell in response to MTB is generally considered the major mechanism of host defense. TB-resistant B6 mice express only one MHC Class II molecule - H2-Ab on their antigen-presenting cells (APC), whereas I/St mice express both MHC Class II molecules - H2-Aj and H2-Ej. A priori it was impossible to judge whether the defect in TB defense in mice bearing the H2 j haplotype was determined by sub-optimal antigen presentation by the H2-Aj compared",

A priori it was impossible to judge whether the defect in TB defense in mice bearing the H2 j haplotype was determined by sub-optimal antigen presentation by the H2-Aj compared to the H2-Ab molecule, or by the parallel presentation of mycobacterial antigens by two Class II molecules which somehow interfered with the development of protective immunity. To resolve this issue, we assessed the presentation of mycobacterial antigens by the APC derived from mice with different Class II allelic composition.\n\nA mycobacteria-specific CD4+ T cell line derived from I/St mice readily proliferated in the presence of mycobacterial antigens if the APC were derived from mice expressing the H2-Aj molecule, even if the H2-E molecule was not expressed (Fig 6A). Moreover, the presence or absence of H2-E did not change the level of response, suggesting that the H2-A molecule presents mycobacterial antigens to the vast majority of T-cell clones. To prove that the H2-E-recognizing T-cell clones have not been lost due to repeated stimulation during T-cell line development, we repeated the experiment with highly purified CD4+ T cells from TB-immune lymph nodes of I/St mice and obtained similar results (Fig 6B).\n\nRecombinant B6.I-100 and B6.I-139 mice express the H2-E molecule due to the presence of the H2-Ej α-chain. These mice possess identical H2-Aj α-chains but differ in their H2-Aj β-chains (Fig 4). To determine in which context mycobacterial antigens were presented to T cells by newly originated H2 haplotypes and to evaluate the efficacy of antigen presentation by recombinant H2-Aβ chains, we assessed the response of T-cells from recombinant mice in the presence of different APC. As shown in Fig 6C and 6D, B6.I-100 and B6.I-139 T cells recognized mycobacterial antigens in the context of the H2-A, but not the H2-E, molecule. Interestingly, B6.I.100 T-cells did not distinguish fully syngenic Aj* and progenitor Aj, whereas B6.I-139 T cells recognized only Ab* β-chain, most likely because the hybrid H2-Aβb/Aαj molecule was formed. Taken together, these results indicate that the H2-A molecule plays a pivotal role in the presentation of mycobacterial antigens and the generation of TB-specific CD4+ T cell responses. The Aj and Aj* allelic variants are not intrinsically defective in the antigen-presenting function and elicit a level of T cell proliferation in response to soluble mycobacterial antigens similar to the Ab and Ab* alleles.\n\nThese observations provided an opportunity to functionally test whether or not the result of T cell interaction with infected macrophages depends upon H2-A alleles. To this end, we performed co-culture experiments with macrophages from B6 and congenic B6.I-9.3.19.8 (see Fig 1) mice and immune effector CD4 T-cells obtained from (B6 x B6.I-9.3.19.8) F1 mice, which are able to interact with both allelic forms of H2-A. The H2-E-negative strain B6.I-9.3.19.8 was used instead of B6.I-100 to further exclude possible influence of the H2-E expression. As shown in Fig 6E, T-cells profoundly increased the ability of B6 and F1 peritoneal macrophages to inhibit mycobacterial growth, whereas only marginal effect was seen in B6.I-9.3.19.8 macrophages, suggesting that recognition of “protective” H2-Ab vs. “non-protective” H2-Aj molecules by CD4+ T-cells leads to profound differences in macrophage activation. Remarkably, moderate capacity to inhibit mycobacterial growth in the absence of T-cells was similar in all macrophages, regardless their genetic origin. This is in full agreement with theoretical expectations: Class II alleles do not regulate the level of innate protective response. These results provide additional independent conformation in support of the conclusion that the H2-A allelic variation is sufficient to determine prominent variations in acquired anti-mycobacterial immunity. In contrast with experiments on genetic restriction of antigen-specific response described above, reciprocal functional experiment (activation of F1 macrophages by H2-A b and H2-A j T-cells) would not be informative, since allogenic Class II recognition provides unpredictable effects.\n\nMolecular modeling\n\nA BLAST search in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for α- and β-chains of the H2-Aj molecule revealed the highest score of sequence similarity (88% and 85% identity, respectively) with the protein 2P24, with deletions or insertions lacking. Comparison between H2-Aj and H2-Ab (PDB id 1MUJ) provided sequence identity of 93% and 89% for α- and β-chains, respectively, with the 2-AA deletion (P65 and E66) in the former allele. Two molecular models of the H2-Aj protein based upon atomic coordinates of 1MUJ and 2P24 provided a high level of similarity around the deletion point (S1 Fig), which justified the use of the 1MUJ model for",

Two molecular models of the H2-Aj protein based upon atomic coordinates of 1MUJ and 2P24 provided a high level of similarity around the deletion point (S1 Fig), which justified the use of the 1MUJ model for further comparisons.\n\nComparison between the H2-Aj and H2-Ab molecules suggests that the most prominent structural dissimilarities occur in two protein backbone regions: the 310 helical fragment of the α-chain and the P65E66 deletion in the H2-Aβj chain (Fig 7A). These deviations are not unique and are present in other H2 haplotypes (reviewed in Ref and displayed in S3 Fig). Analysis of the hydrogen bond network between H-2A Class II molecules and, as a model, invariant CLIP peptide stabilizing the complex before an antigenic peptide is loaded, demonstrated that the conserved H-bond interactions and the total number of H-bonds are identical for the H2-Ab and H2-Aj products despite two b → j substitutions, T71K and E74A in the Aβ-chain (Fig 7B and 7C). The Aβ-position E74 is highly conserved among all known mouse H2-A haplotypes (S4 Fig) and the majority of human HLA-DQ molecules. In the H2-Aj molecule, the A74-provided H-bond is lacking; however, it might be functionally substituted by the H-bond from the Aβ K71.\n\nHowever, prominent differences in the structure and size of the peptide-anchoring pockets between the two allelic forms of the H2-A molecule were observed. Structural data for the peptide-anchoring pockets were either available from the 3D structure of the H2-Ab or deduced for the H2-Aj from our model. AA substitutions distinguishing the H2-Aj protein from the prototypic H2-Ab should have profoundly changed the structure of the peptide-binding groove in binding pockets P1, P4, P6, P7 and P9. Due to the substitution L31W and A52T in the α-chain, the volume of the H2-Aj P1 pocket should be appreciably smaller compared to that of H2-Ab (Fig 7D) and, therefore, may accept smaller side chains capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the Aβ T52 hydroxyl group. Changes in other binding pockets are due to substitutions in the β-chain (Fig 7E). The differences between H2-Aj and H2-Ab in the P4 binding pocket include substitutions Y26L, T28S, G13S and the most prominent one—E74A, allowing occupation of the pocket by a neutral residue in H2-Aj instead of a positively charged residue in H2-Ab. Changes in the P6, (substitutions Y30N and T71K), make this pocket in the H2-Aj molecule more permissive for negatively charged residues. Due to the H47F substitution, the pocket P7 is neutral in H2-Aj but positively charged in H2-Ab, while a minor substitution Y37F makes pocket P9 more permissive for lipophilic residues. We consider the most important differences between H2-Aj and H2-Ab to result from a unique substitution Q61K in the α-chain and substitution R70Q in the β-chain, since these substitutions alter the polarity of interactions between two chains (S5 Fig). Two positively charged residues occupying opposite positions in the hybrid H2-A (αj+βb*) (S5 Fig) could well affect the Class II-TCR interactions.",

    "content": "Results\n\nCytokine production upon IFN-γ stimulation in peripheral blood cells\n\nPBMCs from the members of Kindred A were incubated in the presence of LPS and various concentrations of IFN-γ for 48 hours and TNF-α production was analyzed. TNF-α production was severely impaired in PBMCs from P1 (Fig. 1C), and impairment of TNF-α production was also observed in the patient’s sister and father. We carried out whole-blood cytokine analysis for Kindred B. IL-12p40 production in response to BCG and IFN-γ was partially impaired in cells from P2 (Fig. 1D). Thus, a poor response to IFN-γ stimulation was observed in peripheral blood cells from P1, P2 and two close relatives from Kindred A (A.II.1 and A.I.1).\n\nIdentification of STAT1 mutations\n\nWe identified a previously unknown heterozygous mutation, c.2018A>G (p.Lys673Arg; p.K673R), in exon 22 of STAT1 in P1 (Fig. 1A). The same mutation was also detected in the father (A.I.1) and elder sister (A.II.1) of this patient. The elder sister had a history of regional lymph node enlargement after BCG vaccination in infancy. The patient’s father was vaccinated with BCG without complications in infancy and presented no clinical signs suggestive of immunodeficiency.\n\nP2, from Kindred B, was born into a consanguineous family. Neither of her parents have clinical signs suggestive of immunodeficiency, so P2 was suspected to have an autosomal recessive disorder. However, a previously unknown heterozygous mutation, c.1909A>G (p.Lys637Glu; p.K637E), was identified in exon 22 of STAT1 in P2 (Fig. 1B). It was not possible to test the parents of P2.\n\nBoth the p.K637E and p.K673R mutations affect the SH2 domain of STAT1. Alignment of the human STAT1 sequence with those from seven animal species showed that the p.K637 and p.K673 residues have been strictly conserved throughout evolution (Supp. Fig. S1B). We excluded the possibility of these mutations being common or irrelevant polymorphisms, by sequencing 445 healthy controls, including 79 Japanese and 49 Middle Eastern populations.\n\nSTAT1 expression, phosphorylation and dimerization\n\nExpression of the p.K637E and p.K673R STAT1 alleles was demonstrated by analysis of the mRNA produced in EBV-B cells (data not shown). We then carried out immunoblotting to analyze the production and phosphorylation of STAT1 protein, using EBV-B cells from one healthy control, P1, P2, two members of Kindred A carrying the same STAT1 mutation and two other patients with partial (p.L706S/WT) and complete STAT1 deficiency. Similar levels of STAT1 protein were found in all the EBV-B cells analyzed, other than those from a patient with complete STAT1 deficiency, in analyses with an antibody recognizing the C-terminal part of the STAT1α isoform (Supp. Fig. S2A, S2B). However, the EBV-B cells of P1 and P2 displayed levels of STAT1 phosphorylation in response to stimulation with IFN-α and IFN-γ intermediate between those of control and p.L706S/WT cells (Supp. Fig. 2A). The impairment of STAT1 phosphorylation was highly reproducible and was also observed in EBV-B cells from the other family members of Kindred A, AI.1 and AII.1, demonstrating cosegregation of the genotype with the cellular phenotype (Supp. Fig. S2B). We further evaluated STAT1 phosphorylation by transiently transfecting U3C cells with WT and mutant STAT1 constructs and analyzing the phosphorylation of the resulting STAT1 protein in response to stimulation with IFN-α or IFN-γ. The phosphorylation of both p.K637E STAT1 and p.K673R STAT1 was severely impaired, but not entirely abolished, as it is in the p.L706S mutant, demonstrating that the two mutant alleles were severely hypomorphic for STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2A).\n\nWe then assessed STAT1 homodimerization before and after IFN-γ stimulation, by carrying out co-immunoprecipitation with Myc- or Flag-tagged STAT1. In both conditions, the interaction between WT and mutant STAT1 was normal (Supp. Fig. S3A, S3B). In summary, the p.K637E and p.K673R STAT1 alleles are expressed normally to generate mutant STAT1 protein. Unlike the p.L706S mutation, they impair but do not abolish phosphorylation in response to IFN stimulation, and they form homodimers with WT STAT1 before and after IFN-γ stimulation.\n\nNuclear translocation and DNA-binding of STAT1 upon IFN-γ stimulation\n\nU2OS stable transfectants were stimulated with IFN-γ and the nuclear translocation of STAT1 was analyzed. Both WT and mutant STAT1 proteins were found mostly in the cytoplasm before stimulation (Fig. 3A). After IFN-γ stimulation, STAT1 translocation to the nucleus was observed in cells expressing WT, p.Q463H, p.K637E and p.K673R STAT1 (Fig. 3B). However, p.K637E STAT1 and p.K673R STAT1 were also detected in the cytoplasm, suggesting that nuclear translocation was incomplete for these two mutants. Nuclear transduction was abolished in p.L706S STAT1-express",

However, p.K637E STAT1 and p.K673R STAT1 were also detected in the cytoplasm, suggesting that nuclear translocation was incomplete for these two mutants. Nuclear transduction was abolished in p.L706S STAT1-expressing cells. These results suggest that mutant STAT1 proteins can be translocated to the nucleus if they are phosphorylated.\n\nWe assessed the DNA-binding ability of the mutant STAT1 proteins by stimulating EBV-B cells with IFN-γ and carrying out EMSA. EBV-B cells carrying heterozygous p.K637E, p.K673R or p.L706S mutations displayed markedly lower levels of GAF binding to DNA (Supp. Fig. S4A). Impaired GAF binding to DNA was also observed in relatives carrying heterozygous p.K673R mutations (Supp. Fig. S4B). We assessed the intrinsic DNA-binding capacity of mutant STAT1 protein by introducing WT and mutant STAT1 into U3C cells and analyzing the binding of GAF to DNA (Fig. 2B). p.K637E STAT1, like p.Q463H and p.L706S STAT1, was a loss-of-function mutation, resulting in the abolition of GAF binding to DNA. By contrast, p.K673R STAT1, like p.E320Q STAT1, displayed residual DNA binding (approximately 19%), resulting in hypomorphic features. Next, we carried out a cotransfection experiment to determine whether or not these mutants had a dominant-negative effect on WT STAT1. All the mutants had a dose-dependent negative effect on WT STAT1 (Fig. 2C). Thus, these STAT1 mutants have a dominant-negative effect, possibly through their interaction with WT STAT1, on IFN-γ-induced WT STAT1-mediated GAF binding to DNA.\n\nISGF3 formation and DNA-binding in response to IFN-α\n\nWe investigated the impact of STAT1 mutations on IFN-α-induced signaling by assessing ISGF3 DNA-binding activity. Some impairment was suspected in the patients’ EBV-B cells, but it was much milder than that observed for DNA binding by GAF (Supp. Fig. S4A). Similar results were obtained for the cells of siblings carrying the heterozygous K673R mutation (Supp. Fig. S4B). Supershift experiments showed that these GAF or ISGF3 DNA-binding proteins contained STAT1 (data not shown).\n\nBoth K637E and K673R STAT1 exert a dominant-negative effect on GAS activation, but not on ISRE activation\n\nThe p.Q463H, p.K637E and p.L706S STAT1 proteins abolished the transcriptional activity of GAS in response to IFN-γ stimulation (Fig. 4A). However, p.K673R STAT1 retained a low level (approximately 14%) of GAS transcriptional activity. Cotransfection experiments revealed that each of the mutant forms of STAT1 had a negative effect on WT STAT1-mediated GAS transcriptional activity (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, a dose-dependent negative effect on the WT protein was observed for the p.K637E and p.K673R STAT1 proteins, respectively. We also analyzed GAS transcription activity in response to IFN-α stimulation (Supp. Fig. S5). WT STAT1 introduced cells induced GAS transcription activity in response to IFN-α stimulation. However, induction level was weak compared with IFN-γ stimulation. Both p.K637E and p.K673R STAT1 introduced cells showed severe impairment in GAS transcription activity.\n\nWe then investigated IFN-α-induced ISRE transcription activity. The p.Q463H, p.K637E, and p.K673R STAT1 proteins retained some residual ISRE transcriptional activity, whereas ISRE transcriptional activity was abolished in p.L706S STAT1 mutants (Fig. 4B). GAF binds the GAS element via the DNA-binding domain of STAT1, but ISGF3 binds the ISRE element via the DNA-binding domain of IRF-9. These different mechanisms of DNA binding may account for the differences in the results obtained for GAF and ISGF3. Furthermore, these results are consistent with previous reports showing that phosphorylated WT and p.Q463H STAT1 proteins interact with Tyr690-phosphorylated STAT2 following IFN-α stimulation, whereas no such interaction is observed with p.L706S STAT1. Cotransfection experiments revealed that the p.Q463H, p.K637E and p.L706S STAT1 mutations had some negative effects on the WT protein (Fig. 4D). However, these effects were much milder than those on GAS transcriptional activity. No clear dose-dependent negative effect was observed for any of these mutants. These results and those for EMSA suggest that the p.K637E mutation is a loss-of-function mutation and that the p.K673R mutation is a severely hypomorphic mutation affecting the transcriptional activity of GAF. These mutant STAT1 proteins probably have a dominant-negative effect on GAS activation, but not on ISRE activation.\n\nDownstream gene induction in response to IFN-γ and IFN-α\n\nWe stimulated EBV-B cells with IFNs and investigated IFN-γ and/or IFN-α inducible genes, CXCL9, IRF1 and ISG15, by quantitative PCR analysis. EBV-B cells carrying p.K637E, p.K673E and p.L706S mutation showed severe impairment in CXCL9 induction after IFN-γ stimulation (Fig. 5A). The EBV-B cells also showed mild impairment in IR",

EBV-B cells carrying p.K637E, p.K673E and p.L706S mutation showed severe impairment in CXCL9 induction after IFN-γ stimulation (Fig. 5A). The EBV-B cells also showed mild impairment in IRF1 transcription upon IFN-γ stimulation (Fig. 5B). We then analyzed the induction of ISG15, one of the IFN-α-induced ISRE-regulated genes, after IFN-α stimulation. Induction of ISG15 in patients’ cells was comparable to those from healthy controls (Fig. 5C). Since the induction of CXCL9, IRF1 and ISG15 are STAT1-dependent, we used STAT1 null EBV-B cells as a negative control and indeed, induction of these genes was not observed in these cells.\n\nImpact of STAT1 mutations on IL-27 and IL-29 signaling\n\nIL-27 is known to induce both STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation. IL-27 activates GAF and IFN-λ1 activates ISGF3 via STAT1 activation. We assessed phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in response to IL-27 stimulation in U3C transient transfectants (Supp. Fig. S6A). Both p.K637E and p.K673R STAT1 showed partial impairment in STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IL-27 stimulation. In contrast, introduced STAT1 did not affect STAT3 phosphorylation in U3C transfectants. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that both WT and CMC-causing STAT1 mutations do not affect STAT3 phosphorylation. This comparable level of STAT3 phosphorylation upon IL-27 stimulation was also confirmed in EBV-B cells from the patients (Supp. Fig. S6B). From these experiments, it is clear that MSMD-causing STAT1 mutations did not affect STAT3 phosphorylation after IL-27 stimulation. Next, we tested the GAF DNA-binding ability following IL-27 stimulation. EBV-B cells from the patients carrying heterozygous p.K637E, p.K673R or p.L706S mutations displayed low levels of DNA binding by GAF (Supp. Fig. S4A). Furthermore, GAF binding to DNA was abolished in U3C cells transiently expressing p.Q463H, p.K637E, and p.L706S STAT1, whereas residual binding was observed in cells transiently expressing the p.K673R form (Fig. 2B). We then investigated the induction of IFIT1 mRNA in response to IFN-λ1 stimulation. EBV-B cells carrying the p.K673R or p.L706S mutation produced similar levels of IFIT1 mRNA after IFN-λ1 stimulation, whereas EBV-B cells carrying the p.K637E mutation produced larger amounts of IFIT1 mRNA (Fig. 5D). By contrast, STAT1-null EBV-B cells produced no IFIT1 mRNA, suggesting that STAT1 plays a key role in IFIT1 induction after IFN-λ1 stimulation. Thus, EBV-B cells from the patients with AD-MSMD-STAT1 deficiency produced IFIT1 as efficiently as WT cells in response to IFN-λ1 stimulation.",

The retrieved articles were published between 2003 and 2012, and 11 of them were written in Chinese and 10 in English. There were a total of 4, 6, 10 and 7 qualified articles and 353/595, 344/698, 588/878 and 209/676 cases/controls for rs3842787, rs20417, rs20118426 and rs1126643, respectively. Five articles that reported both aspirin resistance and semi-resistance were treated separately. Therefore, there were 26 comparisons in final analysis.\n\nStudy characteristics\n\n17 of 26 comparisons involved Chinese subjects (12 from north China and 5 from south China), 7 involved Caucasians, and 2 involved the mixed populations. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed for rs20118426 and rs1126643 in 2 comparisons, respectively.\n\nThe risk-allele frequencies of rs3842787, rs20417, rs20118426 and rs1126643 were respectively 3.93%, 20.36%, 11.82% and 50.67% in patients, and 4.07%, 12.16%, 11.71% and 30.4% in controls. By ethnicity, the risk-allele frequencies of rs3842787, rs20417, rs20118426 and rs1126643 were respectively 11.64%, 25.0%, 16.09% and 40.77% in Caucasian patients and 11.99%, 9.38%, 17.41% and 32.55% in Caucasian controls, and the corresponding frequencies were respectively 0.08%, 19.59%, 6.17% and 58.58% in Chinese patients and 10.82%, 12.62%, 3.88% and 28.69% in Chinese controls.\n\nOverall analyses\n\nTaking all available comparisons together for each polymorphism observed significant association of COX-2 gene rs20417 and ITGA2 gene rs1126643 with aspirin insensitivity, whereas no significance was found for COX-1 gene rs3842787 and ITGA2B gene rs201184269 under both allelic and dominant models (Table 3). For instance, risk estimates conferred by rs1126643-T allele reached as high as 2.37 (95% CI: 1.44–3.89; P = 0.001) for the occurrence of aspirin insensitivity relative to the alternative allele, and this estimation was more prominent under dominant model (OR = 2.81; 95% CI: 1.54–5.13; P = 0.001), despite marked between-study heterogeneity (P<0.01 for I 2) and low probability of publication bias as reflected by Egger's test (P>0.2). It is also worth mentioning that the significant association of rs20417 with aspirin insensitivity was immune from the disturbance of heterogeneity and publication bias. In addition, excluding comparisons with genotypes deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium yielded almost similar results (Table 3).\n\nSubgroup analyses\n\nTo estimate the influence of categorical confounders, separate analyses were performed within strata involving two or more comparisons (Table 3). By type of aspirin insensitivity, data were insufficient for rs3842787, rs20417 and rs20118426 to assess their associations with aspirin semi-resistance. For rs1126643, risk estimates was remarkably potentiated among patients with aspirin semi-resistance compared with those with aspirin resistance, especially under dominant model (aspirin semi-resistance: OR = 5.44; 95% CI: 1.42–20.83; P = 0.013 versus aspirin resistance: OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.07–3.6; P = 0.03). Heterogeneity was improved greatly for aspirin resistance comparisons.\n\nFurther grouping articles by ethnicity of study populations (mainly Chinese and Caucasian) observed the enhanced prediction of all examined polymorphisms except for rs20417 in Chinese compared with Caucasians (Table 3). Take rs1126643 for example, the odds of aspirin insensitivity in Chinese was nearly threefold relative to in Caucasians under both allelic (OR: 3.58 versus 1.29) and dominant (OR: 4.98 versus 1.49) models. However, a note of caution should be added because heterogeneity might potentially restrict the interpretation of risk estimates in Chinese (allelic model: I 2 = 76.5% and dominant model: I 2 = 51.0%).\n\nMeta-regression analyses\n\nTo further explore other potential sources of heterogeneity, a multivariable meta-regression model incorporating available study-level continuous covariates was conducted. Differences in percentage of CAD between patients and controls explained a large part of heterogeneity for rs20417 (P = 0.034). Moreover, averaged platelet number was a significant source of heterogeneity for rs1126643 (P = 0.012).",

He had recurrent upper respiratory tract and skin infections that started at 3 mo of age necessitating recurrent hospitalizations. Those included episodes of panaritium (at the age of 6, 7, and 9.5 yr) and boils requiring antibiotic intravenous infusion. Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and HSV were found in skin specimens. At the age of 10 yr, he received a prophylactic antibiotic treatment, and since then, he had not developed infections (with the exception of EBV infection [see below]) requiring hospitalization and antibiotic intravenous infusion. At the age of 9 yr and 10 mo, he came to our attention for persistent fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and recurrent lymphadenopathies associated with persistent high blood load of EBV (6.5 × 106 copies/ml; Fig. 1 B). Episodes resolved spontaneously without treatment in a few weeks. High EBV loads were also detected in a liver biopsy (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry of the liver biopsy showed mild portal infiltration with CD3+ CD8+ mononuclear cells (Fig. 1 D). In situ hybridization with Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) probe was mainly positive in CD3+ cells, while most of CD20+ B cells were negative indicative of liver infiltration by EBV-infected T cells. Hydroa vacciniforme–like lesions also contained accumulation of EBV-containing CD8+ T cells that hybridized with EBER (Fig. S1). The presence of EBV in T cells was also examined by PCR on purified CD3+ cells from blood showing a high EBV load (5.3 × 106 copies/µg DNA) in CD3+ cells similar to the level detected in whole blood at that time (5.5 × 106 copies/µg DNA), whereas purified B cells were negative. Blood EBV load remained stably high over the years (between 5.5 × 106 and 6.5 × 106 copies/ml) despite treatment with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1 B). Between the ages of 10 and 14 yr, symptoms recurred one or twice a year. At the age of 14 yr, he developed a fatal acute episode of HLH.\n\nImmunological investigations showed no major abnormalities. The patient had normal T cell counts with fluctuating CD8+ lymphopenia associated with decreased naive CD8+ T cells and an increased proportion of memory CD8+ T cells (Table 1). Prior to anti-CD20 therapy, B cell counts were normal, but there was a nearly complete lack of circulating memory and switched B cells. Ig levels were normal to high for IgG and low to normal for IgM and IgA. Low IgM levels persisted after recovery of normal B cell numbers following anti-CD20 treatment. NK, invariant NKT (iNKT), and mucosal-associated invariant T cell counts were reduced. T cell proliferation in response to CD3, PHA, and antigen stimulations was elevated. Based on the severity of the clinical phenotype, a gene defect leading to T and B cell immunodeficiency was suspected to be the cause of his condition.\n\nThe other healthy siblings were also evaluated repeatedly for the presence of EBV during the study. All had EBV-positive serology with IgG anti-VCA and anti-EBNA. No detectable EBV load was found in the three brothers. In contrast, the asymptomatic 8-yr-old sister exhibited a persistent and elevated blood EBV load (>106 copies/ml) once she encountered EBV at the age of 6 yr (Fig. 1 C). This high EBV load was only slightly reduced by treatment with anti-CD20, indicating that persistent EBV-infected cells were not B lymphocytes. This was confirmed by PCR from purified CD3+ cells, which detected a high content of EBV (5.9 × 106 copies/µg DNA), as well as by EBER staining of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; not shown). Even though she maintained a persistent high viremia, she remained asymptomatic since. She had normal immunological parameters, except that the proportion of memory B cells that was low before the anti-CD20 treatment remained low 2 yr after treatment (Table 1). These results suggest that the sister is affected by the same immunodeficiency, with the possibility of an up-to-now incomplete clinical penetrance.\n\nIdentification of a homozygous LOF mutation in TNFRSF9 in both siblings with EBV-infected T cells\n\nTo identify a gene defect responsible for the disease in the patient and his sister, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in all family members. Because of the consanguinity, an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of the gene defect was applied to filter WES data with a focus on homozygous genetic variations. One significant homozygous variation in TNFRSF9 was identified in exon 4 (NM_001561.5), corresponding to a frameshift point deletion that results in a premature stop codon (chromosome 1, g.7998819delC, c.170delG, p.G57fsX91; Fig. 1 E). It predicted to remove a large part of the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracytoplasmic domains of the protein.

It predicted to remove a large part of the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracytoplasmic domains of the protein. Sanger sequencing confirmed the WES results; only the patient and his sister were homozygous carriers of the mutation, while the parents were heterozygous (Fig. 1 A). Other siblings had heterozygous or WT genotypes. This mutation was not present in public WES and whole-genome sequencing databases and our own databases at IMAGINE Institute.\n\nTNFRSF9 encodes CD137 (also known as 4-1BB), which belongs to the TNF receptor (TNFR) family. CD137 is a costimulatory molecule that is only expressed by activated T cells. When engaged by its ligand (CD137L), CD137 enhances antigen-specific T cell responses, including proliferation, IL-2 secretion, survival, and cytolytic activity. As reported, CD137 expression was only detectable on control T cells that were activated with anti-CD3 antibody, anti-CD3/CD28–coated beads, PHA, or PMA + ionomycin, but not on resting T cells (Fig. 2, A–C). In contrast, T cells of the patient and his sister failed to express CD137 in these conditions. The expression of the full transcript of CD137 was also examined in PHA-activated T cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR and found to be markedly decreased in cells of the patient and his sister, while cells were activated similarly as control cells based on CD25 expression up-regulation (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that the CD137 transcript is subject to nonsense mutation–mediated RNA decay. Furthermore, no alternative spliced CD137 transcripts were detected in cells from the patient and his sister. These findings indicate that the premature stop codon p.G57fsX91 led to the absence of CD137 expression.\n\nThe costimulatory function of CD137 was next examined in T cells of the asymptomatic mutated sister only, since no material was available to test her affected brother. T cell proliferation was assessed following coculture with mouse mastocytoma P815 cells stably expressing or not CD137L (P815-CD137L) in the presence of soluble anti-CD3 antibody at a low concentration (; Fig. 2 D). Coculture with P815-CD137L cells, but not with CD137L-negative P815 (P815-empty), triggered proliferation and up-regulation of the activation marker CD25 of both control CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from a healthy donor (Fig. 2 E, left panels). Importantly, dividing control CD25+ T cells expressed CD137, whereas nonproliferating cells were negative for CD137 (Fig. 2 F, upper panels). In contrast, T cells of the sister failed to proliferate when cocultured with CD137L-expressing P815 (Fig. 2 E, right panels), while CD137 was not detected (Fig. 2 F, lower panels). However, CD3/CD28-dependent proliferation of T cells of the sister (as well as the patient) was preserved and thus unaffected by CD137 deficiency (Fig. 6 E and Fig. 7, A and B).\n\nTo formally prove that the premature stop codon p.G57fsX91 in CD137 was responsible for the defect of CD137L-triggered proliferation, CD137 expression was restored in T cells of the sister by transfecting PBMCs with a CD137-containing lentiviral vector or an empty vector (Figs. 3 and S2). CD137 expression was achieved in >40% of CD8+ T cells of the sister (Fig. 3 A). Restored CD137 expression by both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was associated with their ability to proliferate and to express CD25 when cocultured with P815-CD137L, but not with P815-empty (Figs. 3 B and C and S2 and data not shown). Overexpression of CD137 by control CD8+ and CD4+ T cells only resulted in a slight increase of proliferating CD137+ T cells. These results demonstrate that the mutation in TNFRSF9 identified in the patient and his sister behaves as an amorphic mutation leading to impaired T cell expansion toward cells expressing CD137L. Thus, the loss of costimulatory function of CD137 in activated T cells of the patient and his sister could impair clearance of EBV-infected cells resulting from defective expansion of EBV-specific T cells.\n\nIdentification of a homozygous missense LOF mutation in PIK3CD in the patient, but not in his sister\n\nBecause the patient’s sister has not developed any clinical manifestation despite the persistence of EBV viremia and circulating EBV-infected T cells, we postulated that the patient could be a carrier of an additional genetic factor that might account for the overt clinical phenotype. First, we looked for an allelic reversion event of the TNFRSF9 mutation in the patient’s sister that could have explained why she has no clinical signs. We failed to detect any reversion event in PBMCs and PHA-activated T cells from the sister (as well as from the patient) using Sanger and next-generation sequencing (Fig. S3). Therefore, WES results were reanalyzed considering the sister as not affected. One significant missense biallelic mutation in PIK3CD was identified in the patient at position 9783218 (rs573872848) on chromosome 1, (NM_005026.3 c.",

Therefore, WES results were reanalyzed considering the sister as not affected. One significant missense biallelic mutation in PIK3CD was identified in the patient at position 9783218 (rs573872848) on chromosome 1, (NM_005026.3 c.2462G>A) in exon 20 that led to a R821H substitution (Fig. 4 A). In public WES and whole-genome sequencing databases and own databases, the mutation was only found as heterozygous with a frequency of 3.8 × 10−5. The mutation was further verified by Sanger sequencing confirming the autosomal recessive inheritance in the kindred (Fig. 4 B). Both parents were heterozygous carriers of the mutation as well as the sister and one brother, while the other siblings were not mutated. The patient was thus the only homozygous carrier of the mutation. PIK3CD encodes p110δ, the catalytic subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PIK3CD deficiency was recently reported to cause immunodeficiency in four patients, but the functional consequences of the PIK3CD defect were not studied. p110δ is highly expressed in lymphocytes and is the main active isoform of the PI3K catalytic subunit in human T cells. p110δ associates with the regulatory p85α subunit which is also shared with other isoforms of PI3K catalytic subunit, including the p110γ and p110α.\n\nReduced kinase activity of the mutant PIK3CD/p110δ R821H\n\nThe R821H mutation is located in a highly conserved region of the p110δ catalytic domain. To characterize the impact of this mutation, analysis of the three-dimensional structures of p110δ–p85α complexes was undertaken. p110δ associates with its p85α subunit through interactions outside the kinase domain and involves the adaptor-binding domain (ABD) and the C2 domains (; Fig. 4 C). The R821 is located in the β6-β7 loop of the kinase domain in the vicinity of the active site that includes the gatekeeper I825 and catalytic lysine K779 (Fig. 4 D, upper panel). R821 and D820 are the only amino acids in the kinase domain able to establish bonds, after side-chain rotamer change, with p85α Q475 (H-bond) and E468 (salt-bridges). Thus, these interactions provide a specific contact point between the p110δ kinase domain and p85α, in addition to the well-recognized contacts made between p85α and the ABD and the C2 domain, which are shared by all isoforms. The former specific contact is lost in the p110δ R821H mutant protein. Such an interaction does not exist between p110α and p85α, where the equivalent amino acid to R821 in p110δ is a cysteine (C844), which makes an endogenous H-bond with the G802 residue, thereby contributing to the structure of the catalytic site (Fig. 4 D, lower panel; and Fig. 4 E). Similarly, the R821 likely contributes to the structure of the catalytic site through a salt bridge formed with the E468 of p85α. When this specific conformation is disrupted, kinase activity is likely impaired.\n\nWe therefore tested the respective consequences of the R821H substitution on both p110δ enzymatic activity and binding to p85α (Fig. 5). First, whole-cell extracts lysates from control and patient cells showed comparable levels of p110δ and p85α, indicating that the mutation had no impact on p110δ expression (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, immunoprecipitations (IPs) of p85α or p110δ recovered from both donor and patient cell extracts showed comparable amounts of p110δ and p85α, showing that the R821H mutation in p110δ did not disrupt association with p85α. Consequences of the R821H mutation on p110δ kinase activity was next examined in HEK293T cells that transiently expressed WT p110δ, the R821H mutant, or an overactive E1021K p110δ mutant and were cotransfected or not with p85α. Total cell extracts showed comparable expression of both WT and mutated forms of p110δ (Fig. 5 B). In IP experiments, recovery of WT and mutated p110δ was similar and comparable amounts of p85α were found to be associated with p110δ. Immunoprecipitates were then tested for PI3K activity. No production of PIP3 was detected in cells expressing p110δ alone in the absence of p85α, highlighting the need of the p85α subunit for actual kinase activity, as previously reported. Cotransfection of p85α and WT p110δ led to a significant production of PIP3 that was significantly diminished when p85α was coexpressed with the R821H p110δ (Fig. 5 C). As expected, cotransfection of p85α with the overactive E1021K p110δ further increased PIP3 production. Similar diminution in PIP3 production was observed from T cell blast protein extracts of the patient when compared with protein extracts of control cells (Fig. 5, D and E). These data demonstrate that the p110δ R821H mutation behaves as an LOF hypomorphic mutation resulting in a profound defect in PI3K activity.\n\nReduced PI3K-dependent AKT/S6K signaling in patient",

These data demonstrate that the p110δ R821H mutation behaves as an LOF hypomorphic mutation resulting in a profound defect in PI3K activity.\n\nReduced PI3K-dependent AKT/S6K signaling in patient T cells\n\nActivation of the AKT and p70-S6K kinase pathway is dependent on PI3K activity in T cells. Increased phosphorylation of AKT and p70-S6K in T cells is considered a hallmark of patients carrying PIK3CD GOF mutations associated with activated PI3K delta syndrome type 1. Phosphorylation of p70-S6K and AKT on serine 473 and threonine 308 (not shown), respectively, were found to be significantly reduced in T cell blasts of the patient in response to TCR/CD3 stimulation in comparison to control cells (Fig. 6, A–C). However, tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 (Fig. 6 A) and whole tyrosine phosphorylation signals (data not shown) that are independent of PI3K activity were equivalent between patient and control cells. Residual AKT phosphorylation in patient cells is likely explained by the hypomorphic nature of the mutation and/or by the activity of other PI3K catalytic subunit isoforms. Of note, the p110δ-specific pharmacological inhibitor IC87114 reduced TCR/CD3–induced AKT phosphorylation in control cells to a level comparable to that seen in cells of the patient (Fig. 6 C). These results show that decreased kinase activity of the mutant R821H p110δ leads to reduced AKT and p70-S6K activation in patient T cells.\n\nIncreased proliferation of patient T cells associated with an elevated Ca2+ influx\n\nPI3K-dependent signaling is known to regulate many lymphocyte functions, including cell survival and proliferation. Hence, we assessed T cell proliferation using a vital dye tracer. It was striking to observe that patient T cells directly tested from PBMCs or T cell blasts in culture exhibited a significantly increased proliferation in comparison to control cells in response to TCR/CD3 stimulation (Fig. 6, D and E). However, T cell blasts from the patient exhibited normal degranulation and activation-induced cell death upon anti-CD3 stimulation as well as normal apoptosis upon anti-FAS stimulation, indicating that not all T cell functions were increased (Fig. S4, A–C). We also examined intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and the MAPK/ERK pathway in response to TCR activation, which are known to be downstream and dependent of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) metabolism in T cells. Ca2+ flux and phospho-ERK to anti-CD3 stimulation were found to be increased in patient T cells when compared with control cells (Fig. 6, F–H). Consistent with increased Ca2+ flux, phospho-PLCγ1 was found to be enhanced in T cells of the patient upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. S4 D).\n\nT cells of the sister, who is heterozygous for the PIK3CD mutation, were also evaluated, showing an intermediate decrease of TCR-dependent AKT phosphorylation and Ca2+ flux upon CD3 stimulation when compared with the patient (Fig. 7 D; and Fig. S4, E and F), while T cell proliferation upon stimulation with CD3 alone or CD3/CD28–coated beads was not significantly different from that of controls cells (Figs. 7 A and S4 G). Taken together, these results indicate that the LOF of R821H mutation in PIK3CD independently of the mutation in TNFRSF9 is associated with increased TCR-dependent proliferation and calcium mobilization in T cells.\n\nWe previously reported that CD27, another costimulatory molecule of the TNFR superfamily expressed by T cells, is required for expansion of EBV-specific T cells toward EBV-infected B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) expressing CD70, the ligand of CD27. CD27-dependent T cell proliferation toward LCL-expressing CD70 (LCL-CD70+) or CD70-negative LCL (LCL-CD70−) was analyzed with T cells from the patient and his sister (Fig. 7 B). LCL-CD70+, but not LCL-CD70−, triggered proliferation of T cells from the sister that was normal or slightly increased compared with control cells. Proliferation of T cells from the patient was increased in the same conditions. CD27 was found normally expressed on T cells from the sister and the patient (Fig. 7 C). The increased CD27-dependent proliferation in the patient might suggest a compensatory mechanism for the absence of the CD137 pathway and/or related to the increased proliferation rate of activated T cells associated with the R821H mutation in PIK3CD.\n\nImbalanced phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCγ1)–dependent signals in PIK3CD-deficient T cells\n\nBecause of the lack of available material from the patient and in order to further demonstrate the effect of the R821H p110δ mutation on T cell responses, two Jurkat T cell lines deficient for p110δ (PIK3CD−/−) were generated by the CRISPR-Cas9 technology using RNA guides targeting respectively exon 4 or exon 5 of PIK3CD (referred as CRISPR-Ex4 and CRISPR-Ex5).

They were then reconstituted with the R821H mutant, the GOF E1021K mutant, or WT p110δ/PIK3CD (Figs. 8 and S5). Absence of p110δ expression in CRISPR-Ex4 and CRISPR-Ex5 cell lines was confirmed by Western blot (WB) analysis (Fig. 8 A). CRISPR-Ex4 and CRISPR-Ex5 cell lines transduced with WT, R821H p110δ, or E1021K p110δ coding lentiviruses showed comparable levels of p110δ (Figs. 8 B and S5). Constitutive AKT phosphorylation was examined and found to be increased in cells reconstituted with the activating E1021K mutant and reduced in cells expressing the inactive R821H mutant or in cells transduced with the empty vector (Figs. 8 C and S5). Of note, in Jurkat cells, AKT phosphorylation/activation and proliferation are constitutive and uncoupled to the TCR activation, in contrast to Ca2+ mobilization, which still requires TCR-CD3 stimulation. When compared with E1021K p110δ–expressing cells, proliferation of p110δ-deficient cells and R821H p110δ–expressing cells was significantly increased (Fig. 8, E and D; and Fig. S5). Anti-CD3-induced calcium flux was also found to be increased (Figs. 8 F and S5). The abnormal T lymphocyte phenotypes of the patient were thus recapitulated in these Jurkat cell lines. Taken together, these results demonstrate that impaired PI3K activity leads to an increased calcium flux and cell proliferation, while increased PI3K activity results in the opposite phenotypes.\n\nCalcium entry and ERK1/2 activation are initiated by PLCγ1, which shares with p110δ the same PIP2 substrate. TCR-dependent activation of PLCγ1 results in the cleavage of PIP2 into inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. IP3 and diacylglycerol are second messengers that activate Ca2+ mobilization and the MAPK pathway, respectively. Thus, our findings strongly suggest the existence of a balance between PLCγ1–dependent and PI3K-dependent signaling pathways that could compete for PIP2 availability. To test this hypothesis, we examined PLCγ1 and MAPK activation in response to TCR-CD3 stimulation in WT Jurkat cells compared with PIK3CD-deficient Jurkat cell lines (Figs. 8 G and S5). Phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and ERK1/2 kinases, which are known to reflect PLCγ1 and MAPK activation, was tested in response to anti-CD3 stimulation. Strikingly, a constitutive phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 was strongly detectable in PIK3CD-deficient cell lines, but not in WT cells. In PIK3CD-deficient cells, TCR-CD3 activation led to a further increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was more intense, fast, and blunted more rapidly compared with WT cells. Activation did not further increase PLCγ1 phosphorylation, which was already very high in unstimulated cells. In p110δ-deficient cells reconstituted with R821H, a marked constitutive phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 was detectable, while in cells reconstituted with the GOF E1021K mutant, constitutive PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was low (Figs. 8 H and S5). Therefore, these data show that in the absence of p110δ or impaired p110δ activity, PLCγ1 is more active, leading to increased calcium flux and activation of the downstream MAPK pathway. This may likely result in increased proliferation.",

    "content": "Results\n\nGenetic variation at the tagging SNP rs12979680 3 kb upstream of IL28B is associated with risk of allergic disease\n\nWe present data showing support for IL28B playing a role in allergic disease. We genotyped 70 children (35 allergic and 35 non-allergic; Cohort 1) for the tagging SNP rs12979860 that resides 3 kb upstream of IL28B. Carriage of the T allele at rs12979860 has previously been shown to be highly predictive of poor Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and treatment outcome. Here, presence of the T allele at rs12979860 was over-represented in children with allergic disease (p = 0.004; OR = 4.56, CI 1.7–12.6) (Fig. 1a). Although the frequency of the C allele was lower in allergic children compared to non-allergic children (0.6 vs 0.8, respectively) the strongest predictor of allergic disease was carriage of the T allele. The odds ratio obtained for this relationship (OR = 4.6) is akin to what was observed in a recent study examining the relationship between IL28B and HCV infection outcome in a single source cohort of similar size (OR = 4.1) (Fig. 1b). The single source cohort comprises women who were exposed to HCV contaminated immunoglobulin D in Ireland in the 1970s and inherently controls for ascertainment bias, clinical, demographic and viral factors that allow the optimal platform to assess the IL28B genetic contribution to HCV outcome. In studies that cannot account for these factors, the odds ratios obtained for the association of IL28B variants and HCV outcome are much lower (OR = 3.0 vs OR 4.1 and 7.4). In this study, the strict criteria used to assess allergic and non-allergic (non-atopic) children removed several confounding factors that allowed a better assessment of host genetic contribution to allergic disease. As sensitisation against environmental allergens in the Australian population is highly prevalent, the criteria used to select non-allergic children is critical and in this cohort selection for non-atopic children was based on an extensive array of clinical tests over the first five years of life; a critical period of immune ontogeny. Conservative assessment of the phenotype definition can offset the value of larger sample size in disease gene association studies. Accordingly, the robust relationship we find between IL28B and allergic disease in a relatively small sample size suggests that IL28B (and effects on IFNλ-3 levels) is likely to play a dominant role in the susceptibility and development of allergic disease. These results are comparable to what has been reported for HCV infection and treatment outcome in which it is well established that IL28B variants are the strongest host genetic contributor to HCV outcome.\n\nAssociation between rs12979860 genotype and food allergy: Validation of genetic association in food allergic cohort\n\nWe then extended our analysis between allergic phenotype and carriage of the T allele at rs12979860 to a second paediatric cohort (n = 30; Cohort 2) in which subjects were defined as clinically food allergic. These subjects were recruited from the same clinic and therefore have similar demographic characteristics as Cohort 1. When we compared these subjects to the screened non-allergic subjects (controls) as described above we found that carriage of the T allele at rs12979860 is also associated with food allergy (p = 0.04; OR = 3.0, CI 1.8–5.2) (Fig. 1b). Interestingly for Cohort 2 but not Cohort 1, the frequency of the homozygote T/T genotype was higher than observed in the non-allergic children (Fig. 1a). Accordingly, all subsequent analyses performed on Cohort 1 examined the influence of carriage of the T “risk” allele.\n\nAssociation of rs12979860 genotype with allergic disease increases with age\n\nIn order to assess the impact of IL28B on early allergic phenotype, we examined the association of rs12979860 genotype with allergic outcome during early childhood using subjects in Cohort 1, as detailed clinical data on these subjects had been collected from follow-up visits during the first five years of life. There is a clear association between carriage of the T allele of rs12979860 and development of early allergic disease, particularly for sensitization against environmental antigens and IgE-mediated food allergy (Fig. 2). In the case of atopic dermatitis, there is a trend for discrimination between the rs12979860 genotype during the first year of life and this becomes significant from 2.5 years of age (Fig. 2). Clear diagnosis of asthma cannot be determined during the first year of life however carriage of the T allele is significantly associated with asthma diagnosis by age 5.\n\nGender bias in the association of rs12979860 genotype with allergic disease\n\nThere is a significant interaction between gender and carriage of the T allele of rs12979860 for allergic disease (P = 0.04). The effect is particularly evident for sensitization (Fig. 3a top) and to a lesser extent for atopic dermatitis (Fig. 3a bottom) but not for asthma or IgE-mediated food allergy during early childhood (data not shown). Interestingly, it was only amongst females that we found differential trends in allergy status with age relative to rs12979860 genotype. Carriage of the T allele of rs12979860 in females but not males was associated with increased risk of sensitisation with age (P = 0.02; Fig. 3b). Conversely, amongst females with the C/C genotype we see a reduction in the proportion with atopic dermatitis with age (P =",

Conversely, amongst females with the C/C genotype we see a reduction in the proportion with atopic dermatitis with age (P = 0.04; Fig. 3b).\n\nrs12979860 genotype correlates with innate immune function\n\nWe then examined the association between TLR-mediated innate immune function (namely IL-1B, TNF alpha cytokine production after TLR ligation with classical model ligands) and rs12979860 genotype. We have previously shown a differential in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokine production after cord blood stimulation with select TLR ligands is associated with either allergic and non-allergic status in later life. Briefly, children with allergic disease have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at birth (in cord blood) and during their early postnatal period, however this responsiveness declines with age and by pre-school age (5 years) is significantly depressed compared to age-matched non-allergic controls. In non-allergic children, TLR responses mature with age, which is necessary to elicit appropriate responses to pathogens. Here we show that this key difference in immune ontogeny is significantly associated with rs12979860 genotype and can be seen after the stimulation with the majority of TLR ligands (Fig. 4). In general, subjects with the C/C genotype (solid lines) are characterised by significantly lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production at birth after TLR-dependent stimulation (exception being TLR8). For these individuals with the C/C genotype, a postnatal increase in IL-1β and TNF-α production following TLR stimulation (most pronounced for TLR2, 3, 4 and 7) is observed (Fig. 4). These findings are contrasted by the profile of TLR-dependent cytokine responses in children carrying the T “risk” allele (that is, C/T or T/T genotype; dashed lines) (Fig. 4), which shows high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at birth (in cord blood) in response to TLR ligation. Furthermore, TLR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in these children decline with age (in particular TNF production). These findings are consistent with our previous observation in the same cohort showing a similar distinguishing pattern in cytokine profiles in allergic and non-allergic during the maturation of the immune system over the first five years of life. Although this can be seen in male and female children, these trends are most pronounced in females with the C/C genotype (Fig. 4).",

    "content": "Results\n\nClinical presentation of three siblings\n\nThree siblings, born to consanguineous parents, were referred to the endocrine outpatient clinic at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City in Abu Dhabi for severe post-natal growth failure. The oldest sibling, patient 1 (P1), was conceived by in-vitro fertilization and born premature at 25 weeks but appropriate for gestational age (AGA) with a birth weight of 650-g and birth length of 30 cm. As a neonate, P1 was hospitalized for pneumonia with sepsis, requiring antibiotic treatments and supplemental oxygen. After discharge, she developed recurrent urinary tract and pulmonary infections, resulting in multiple hospitalizations that reduced in frequency with age and responded to antibiotics. She additionally had severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, feeding difficulties resulting in failure to thrive, and was developmentally delayed. P1 presented to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) at 4.8 years old with a GHI phenotype including severe short stature (height SDS −6.5), centripetal fat distribution, a prominent forehead, and a depressed nasal bridge. Atopic disease was present including eczema and reactive airway disease requiring corticosteroids. P1 was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and treated with levothyroxine. She additionally developed idiopathic thrombocytopenia at age 4 that resolved in months and recurred at age 7. She showed a temporarily positive treatment response to IVIG and dexamethasone, but platelet counts were normalized and sustained upon treatment with sirolimus. She did not develop ear, sinus, or skin infections or fungal infections. No lymphadenopathy was noted on physical exams.\n\nPatient 2 (P2) was born AGA at 37 weeks, weighing 2040-g. At the time of presentation, he was 2 years old with severe short stature and height SDS of −5.06, displaying a GHI phenotype similar to P1. P2 developed recurrent infections of the skin, urinary tract, and lungs requiring antibiotics and often supplemental oxygen. He presented with general lymphadenopathy at the time of evaluation. Similar to P1, chronic eczema and reactive airway disease developed. At presentation, P2 was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and treated with levothyroxine.\n\nPatient 3 (P3) presented at 7 months of age and was born AGA at 35 weeks, weighing 1900-g, but presented with severe short stature (height SDS −4.7) and facial dysmorphism. She had failure to thrive, and experienced recurrent skin and pulmonary infections requiring antibiotics and supplemental oxygen. P3 initially presented with atopic eczema and over the years of follow-up developed reactive airway disease. At age 2, she was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and treated with levothyroxine. P3 additionally had gastroesophageal reflux disease. No lymphadenopathy was noted.\n\nFamily history was negative for severe short stature that required medical attention, and both parents were of near-normal heights. When evaluated at CCHMC, the three siblings were placed on recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (rhIGF-1) to improve growth. The clinical presentation of these three siblings is outlined in Table 1.\n\nIdentification of novel homozygous nonsense STAT5B mutation in three siblings\n\nAt presentation, each sibling had normal serum GH levels and below-normal IGF-1, IGF-BP3, and acid labile subunit (ALS) concentrations, consistent with GHI. These abnormally low values and clinical phenotype prompted WES analysis of P1 at age 3.9. Trio clinical whole exome sequencing revealed 112,781 variants in P1, with only one candidate associated with growth and immune impairments, a homozygous variant in STAT5B, c.1892G>A, converting a tryptophan at position 631 to a nonsense residue, p.W631*. Other candidate variants can be found in Table S2. Sanger sequencing revealed heterozygosity in this STAT5B locus in both parents (Figure S1A), and sequencing of dermal fibroblast cultures from each sibling confirmed the presence of the mutation (Figure S1B). Interestingly, this novel mutation is adjacent to the first identified mutation in STAT5B, p.A630P (Figure S1C). The resulting protein lacks ~50% of the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, the critical phosphorylated tyrosine at position 699, and the entire transactivation domain (TAD).\n\nReconstitution analyses reveal impairments in the expression and function of the STAT5B p.W631* protein\n\nThe SH2 and TAD domains are critical for STAT5B activation, homodimer formation, and driving transcriptional activation. To evaluate the functional capacity of the STAT5B p.W631* mutation, we performed in vitro reconstitution analyses in HEK-GHRs. The truncated STAT5B p.W631* protein was significantly reduced in expression compared to wild-type FLAG-STAT5B (F-STAT5B WT) (Figure 1A and B). F-STAT5B WT, but not F-STAT5B p.W631*, was phosphorylated following GH treatment (Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence analyses revealed impaired nuclear localization of the F-STAT5B p.W631* protein following GH treatment (Figure 1C and D). Our results reveal reduced expression of the STAT5B p.W631* variant and an inability to be phosphorylated or traffic into the nucleus upon GH stimulation.\n\nSustained B cell hyperactivity is associated with atopy and autoimmunity in STAT5B deficient siblings\n\nThe identification of a LOF STAT5B variant in our patients prompted an evaluation of immune profiles. STAT5B deficient patients typically have reductions in the number of NK cells along with impaired function, and normal to elevated levels of",

Our results reveal reduced expression of the STAT5B p.W631* variant and an inability to be phosphorylated or traffic into the nucleus upon GH stimulation.\n\nSustained B cell hyperactivity is associated with atopy and autoimmunity in STAT5B deficient siblings\n\nThe identification of a LOF STAT5B variant in our patients prompted an evaluation of immune profiles. STAT5B deficient patients typically have reductions in the number of NK cells along with impaired function, and normal to elevated levels of B cells with increased immunoglobulin production. From infancy through early childhood, each sibling displayed normal numbers of NK cells (Table S1), B cells, and serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM (Table 2). Serum levels of IgE were consistently elevated in P1 and P2 (Table 2). These sustained elevations in IgE were associated with the development of chronic eczema and reactive airway disease, consistent with an atopic phenotype often associated with STAT5B deficiency. In early childhood, each sibling carried anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (Table 2).\n\nSTAT5B is important for the maintenance of T cell levels\n\nWhile immune defects associated with LOF STAT5B mutations vary, 7 out of 9 STAT5B deficient patients evaluated were moderately to severely T cell lymphopenic at the time of diagnosis. It remains unknown whether the systemic T cell reduction in these patients is due to impaired thymic T cell production or peripheral destruction. Studies of Stat5b−/− mice revealed normal levels of thymocytes and reduced splenocytes, while Stat5a−/−b−/− mice showed significant reductions in both thymocytes and splenocytes. To evaluate thymic output of T cells in the absence of functional STAT5B, levels of recent thymic emigrants (RTE) were assessed by quantification of CD4+CD45+CD31+ T cells. At 7 months of age, P3 displayed reduced RTEs that normalized the following year (Table 3). At 2 years of age, P2 displayed a low-normal RTE level that normalized over the following years. P1, who was evaluated at 4 years old, had normal RTEs throughout the evaluation.\n\nAnnual immune analyses did not reveal any alterations in total T cell levels, with the absolute number and total percentage of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells remaining within normal ranges in all three siblings (Table 3). The CD4:CD8 ratio also remained normal as previously reported. The normal levels of peripheral T cells from infancy to early childhood in the three young siblings suggest that STAT5B is likely dispensable for T lymphocyte development in these siblings, but may be important for long-term maintenance of T cell levels as older STAT5B deficient patients typically manifest T cell lymphopenia.\n\nSTAT5B may be responsible for the maintenance, rather than generation, of regulatory T cells\n\nRoles of STAT5B in IL-2 signaling include FOXP3 induction, Treg function, and self-tolerance in both humans and mice. Prior reports demonstrate reduced numbers and function of Tregs in STAT5B deficient patients; however, these evaluations were made when the patients were older and had already developed severe immune and pulmonary complications. In our younger patients, we annually evaluated the absolute numbers and total percentage of Tregs identified as CD4+ cells either expressing high levels of CD25 and low levels of CD127 (CD25+CD127low) or CD25 and FOXP3 (CD25+FOXP3+). Interestingly, the absolute number and total percentage of FOXP3+ Tregs were normal in P2 and P3 between the ages of 7 months and 5 years (Figure 2A–B, Figure S2). Reductions in Tregs were not consistently identified in P1 until age 8 (Figure 2A–C). However, the total percentage of CD4+CD25+CD127low T cells was reduced by the age of 3 years in each sibling (Figure 2D). These data suggest that the LOF STAT5B variant in these siblings impairs the maintenance of FOXP3 expression over time rather than the initial generation of FOXP3+ Tregs.\n\nPronounced dysregulation of memory CD8+ T cells in young STAT5B deficient siblings\n\nWhen evaluated, STAT5B deficient patients often have reduced naïve T cells and elevations in T cells with a memory/activation phenotype. Each of our siblings had modest but persistently reduced proportions of both CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T cells and elevated proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells (Figure S3, Figure S4A and B, Figure 3A and B). Evaluation of CD4+ T cell activation markers including CD69+, CD71+, CD40L+, CD134+, HLA+, and CD95+, were unremarkable (Table S1). The impact of STAT5B on memory T cell subsets including CD45RO+CCR7+ central memory (TCM), CD45RO+CCR7− effector memory (TEM), and CD45RA+CCR7− effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) were also evaluated in each sibling. CD4+ and CD8+ TCM cells remained within normal ranges (Figure S4C, Figure 3C). No alterations in the proportion CD4+ TEM cells were identified (Figure S4D), but increases in CD8+ TEM cell proportions became clinically significant with age in each sibling (Figure 3D). Elevations in the percentage of CD8+ TEMRA cells detected during infancy in P2 and P3 normalized around age 4 and remained normal in P1 (Figure 3E). A dys",

A dysregulation of CD8+ T cells was noted despite normal CD4+ memory T cell subsets, an observation not previously reported for STAT5B deficiency.

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nIn the present study we utilized results from a previous investigation, namely, the sequencing‐based genotyping results of exon 2 in the HLA‐DRB1 and exons 2 and 3 in the HLA‐DQB1 genes of 359 ALL children with known ASP hypersensitivity status. 6  As a follow‐up cohort, a subset of these patients (n = 241) was enrolled. They were chosen based on the availability of their DNA samples. In the follow‐up cohort, we performed the genotyping of the 4 selected SNPs (Table 1) and investigated their potentials as predictors for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 carrier status (SNP‐genotyped subpopulation). Using the Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay the success rate of rs28383172 genotyping was 98%. Two patients had to be excluded due to the poor quality of their DNA samples; therefore, out of 241, a total of 233 patients were finally included in the analysis (Table 2). From the genotyping using KASPar‐on‐Demand prevalidated assays, genotypes were available for all 3 SNPs (rs2395182, rs4713586 and rs7775228) in all 233 patients. Based on the genotyping results, linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficients were calculated between the 4 SNPs in our population and based on the 1000 Genomes dataset in several super populations. As can be seen in Figures S1 and S2 there was LD between the investigated SNPs in all populations and the LD coefficients in the Hungarian population were most similar to those of in the EUR super population.\n\nBased on the literature, the genotypes determined for each SNP were classified as positive and negative predictors of HLA type separately (Supporting Information Table S1). We then evaluated the results as follows: (i) the association of rs28383172 AG or GG genotypes and HLA‐DRB1*07:01 carrier status; (ii) the association of rs28383172 AG or GG genotypes and HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status; (iii) the association of rs2395182 TT or TG and rs4713586 TT and rs7775228 TC or CC genotypes and HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status; (iv) patients meeting both the second and the third conditions were checked for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status; and (v) patients with rs28383172 AG or GG and rs7775228 TC or CC genotypes were examined for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status (Supporting Information Table S2). The fifth algorithm was raised as a possible approach in data evaluation, during which we examined the contribution of each SNP in different combinations to positive prediction (Figure 1).\n\nThe performance of each test can be seen in Table 3. Carrying the G allele of rs28383172 was in perfect concordance with the HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele carrier status. Two‐thirds of the patients harbouring HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele were HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carriers. The rest of the patients did not carry the HLA‐DQB1*02:02 allele. Thus, algorithms II–V were designed to identify the same group of patients. The last of these, i.e. the 2‐SNP approach, seems to be the most suitable for clinical utilization with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values all greater than 95%.\n\nTo confirm our results in other populations, the performance of the different combinations of the tag SNPs was also assessed in the 1000 Genomes dataset. The results obtained for algorithm I were the same as those described by Erlichster et al. 8  For algorithm V, we found 100% sensitivity and >95% specificity in 3 out of 5 super populations, in AMR, EAS and EUR (Figure S3). The SNP combinations used for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype‐tagging in algorithms III and IV did not achieve the performance required for validation in any super population.\n\nWe performed a pairwise comparison of the performance of algorithms II‐V on both the Hungarian and the 1000 Genomes data. In the Hungarian SNP‐genotyped subpopulation, specificity and the positive predictive value of algorithms III, IV and V were significantly higher compared to algorithm II, and, similarly, the specificity and the positive predictive value of algorithm IV were significantly higher compared to algorithm III, while the results of further comparisons were not found to be significant (Supporting Information Table S3). However, in the EUR super population, sensitivity and the negative predictive value of algorithm V, i.e. the 2‐SNP tagging, were significantly higher compared to algorithms III and IV. Besides, specificity and the positive predictive value of algorithm V were significantly higher compared to algorithm II.

The test identified a small proportion of affected patients (sensitivity value of 23.4%), but with good specificity (88.5%) and its positive and negative predictive values were 57.9 and 63.1%, respectively. We note that the performance measures of the HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype and of its best tagger algorithm (V) were identical meanwhile, the latter is not a perfect predictor for the haplotype (i.e. the sensitivity and specificity of algorithm V to tag the haplotype were <100%). The reason for this seemingly contradictory result is that there were 2 patients for whom the tagger algorithm V missed the true haplotype carrier status (one in both directions), but neither had E. coli ASP hypersensitivity, and therefore they did not change the proportion of allergic patients.",

The mean age (years ± SD) of HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls were 36 yrs ± 3.2 and 33 yrs ± 6.47, respectively. The demographic profile of HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls is shown in Table 1.\n\n3.1. Genotype-Phenotype Association\n\n3.1.1. TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) Polymorphism and HIV-Infected Individuals\n\nThe occurrence of TLR7 polymorphism in HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls is shown in Table 2. Polymorphisms rs179008 and rs179009 in TLR7 gene followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.07, 0.05) in healthy controls. The distribution of rs179009 AG genotype in the codominant model, rs179009 AG-GG genotype in the dominant model, and rs179009 AG genotype in the overdominant model was significantly reduced in HIV-infected individuals as compared to healthy controls (18.0% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23-0.77, P = 0.016; 26.7% vs. 36.7%, OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.30-0.89, P = 0.016, and 18% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23-0.77, P = 0.0039).\n\n3.1.2. TLR7 Haplotypes in HIV-Infected Individuals\n\nThe distribution of TLR7 haplotypes (rs179008 and rs179009) in HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls is shown in Table 3. In both polymorphisms, a nonsignificant association was observed in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D′) between HIV-infected individuals vs. healthy controls (D′: 0.2663). Haplotype AG (rs179008∗A/rs179009∗G) was found to be higher in HIV-infected individuals as compared to healthy controls (7.00% vs. 5.41%, OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.64-2.84, P = 0.43).

Gene-Environment Interaction\n\n3.2.1. TLR7 Polymorphism and Environmental Factors\n\nConsumption of tobacco and alcohol in HIV-infected individuals was analyzed for TLR7 polymorphism (Table 5). TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) polymorphisms did not differ between HIV-infected individuals with and without tobacco and alcohol users. The distribution of TLR7 rs179009AG genotype was found to be higher in tobacco-consuming HIV-infected individuals as compared to nonusers (26.1% vs. 17.2%, OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 0.52-5.49, P = 0.47). The prevalence of TLR7 rs179008 CC, CT, and TT genotypes was almost corresponding between tobacco-consuming HIV-infected individuals and nonconsuming (82.6% vs. 82.8%, 13.0% vs. 13.9%, and 4.3% vs. 3.3%).

We found that the minor (i.e., derived) allele for each SNP was psoriasis-protective, with the ancestral haplotype conferring the highest risk. Notably, among haplotypes with at least 1% frequency in the underlying population, the protective alleles at the 1st (rs34536443) and 2nd (rs12720356) positions occur only with the protective allele at the 3rd position (rs2304256) (Fig. 1). SNP rs34536443 encoding TYK2 P1104A is located in the kinase domain, is conserved across 20 mammalian species, predicted to be strongly damaging by Polyphen and was found to alter TYK2 phosphorylation in response to IFN-β. SNP rs12720356 encoding TYK2 I684S is located in the pseudokinase domain, is also conserved across 20 mammalian species, predicted to be strongly damaging, and was found to be catalytically-impaired yet signaling-competent in the context of interferon (IFN)-α activation, likely due to its ability to exert a heterodimeric scaffolding function with other JAKs. SNP rs2304256 encoding V362F resides in the FERM domain involved in cytokine receptor binding, is not predicted to be damaging, and is not conserved across 20 mammalian species or across other JAK family members.\n\nThe TYK2 I684S variant impairs IL-12 stimulated pSTAT4 response\n\nBased on the aforementioned pharmacological evidence for specificity of TYK2 signaling downstream of the IL-12 receptor, we used phospho-flow cytometry to measure IL-12-stimulated T-cell STAT4 phosphorylation in CD3/CD28-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In preliminary experiments, we determined the optimal time and dose of IL-12 stimulation (Figure S1) as well as CD3/CD28 activation (Figure S2). As shown in Figure S3, IL-12 receptors are induced in response to CD3/CD28 activation in purified T-cell populations, to a very similar extent to that seen in PBMC. We studied individuals representing three rs34536443-rs12720356-rs2304256 haplotypes: GAC (ancestral, n = 10), CAA, n = 9, and GCA, n = 10. Characteristics of the study population are shown in Table S2. In our study, the CAA and GCA haplotypes were each paired with the ancestral GAC haplotype. The GAA haplotype, whose component SNP rs2304256 C > A is not highly conserved or predicted to be damaging, was not evaluated.\n\nThe gating strategy is shown in Fig. 2. We found that individuals carrying one copy of the GCA haplotype encoding the protective I684S variant (genotype GCA/GAC) had significantly reduced p-STAT4 levels in CD4+ and CD8+, activated (CD25+) memory (CD45RO+) T-cells, compared to individuals homozygous for the ancestral GAC haplotype (Fig. 3). Similar reductions in p-STAT4 were also observed in skin-homing, cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen (CLA)-positive CD4 and CD8 cells from carriers of the protective I684S variant (Fig. 3). In contrast, we found no significant changes in p-STAT4 for individuals of the CAA/GAC haplotype harboring the psoriasis-associated variant rs34536443 encoding P1104A in the kinase domain, relative to homozygotes for the ancestral haplotype GAC (Fig. 3). We obtained the same result after restricting the analysis to controls (individuals without psoriasis, Figure S4).\n\nBecause JAK-family tyrosine phosphorylation is regarded as an obligate downstream signal transduction response to cytokine stimulation, we also assessed TYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation by ELISA. The characteristics of the analyzed individuals are shown in Table S3. However, as shown in Figure S5, there were no significant differences in TYK2 phosphorylation across any of the three haplotypes.\n\nTYK2 regulates IL-12 dependent gene expression\n\nIn order to ask whether any particular gene responses to IL-12 might be specific targets of TYK2 genetic variation, we carried out RNA-seq analysis of CD3/CD28-activated PBMC harvested after 1 and 4 h of IL-12 treatment. For these experiments, at least five individuals of each haplotype were selected for analysis (Table S4). Differential expression analysis across all three haplotypes as a function of IL-12 treatment identified 52 significantly (FDR <= 0.1 and fold change (FC) log2|FC| ≥ log2|1.5|) dysregulated genes at 1 h (43 up, 9 down, Table S5) and 233 dysregulated genes at 4 h (132 up, 101 down; Table S6). These dysregulated genes displayed significant overlap with a list of 28 IL-12 responsive genes identified from the literature by searching the",

These dysregulated genes displayed significant overlap with a list of 28 IL-12 responsive genes identified from the literature by searching the NCI Biosystems database (4 and 6 genes at 1 h and 4 h, p = 1.05 × 10−7 and 1.09 × 10−7, respectively, Tables S5 and S6). Not unexpectedly, genes significantly up-regulated by 4 h of IL-12 treatment were most highly enriched for the Gene Ontology term “Regulation of interferon gamma mediated signaling pathway” (22.8-fold, FDR = 3.9 × 10−4, Table S7). Notably, after 4 hours of IL-12 treatment, the most significantly up-regulated gene was IL18RAP (average 2.37-fold, FDR p = 1.0 × 10−13), which also manifested a nominally significant effect of TYK2 genotype (ANOVA p = 7.2 × 10−3, Table S10). IL18RAP encodes an accessory subunit of the heterodimeric receptor for interleukin 18 (IL-18), a proinflammatory cytokine involved in inducing cell-mediated immunity. This protein enhances the IL-18-binding activity of the IL-18 receptor and plays a role in signaling by IL-18. IL18RAP is overexpressed 3.4-fold in lesional psoriatic vs. normal skin, and mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, and leprosy.\n\nRegarding the functional effects of rs12720356 encoding TYK2 I684S, we have recently shown that the combined effects of IFN-γ and TNF contribute to increased vascular inflammation, a major cause of cardiovascular comorbidity in psoriasis. While we were unable to demonstrate a significant effect of TYK2 genotype on IFN-γ mRNA expression in this relatively small RNA-seq study (Tables S9 and S10), our finding that IL-12 stimulation rapidly and significantly increases IFN-γ gene expression in anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated PBMC (Tables S5 and S6) has potential functional relevance to systemic inflammation in psoriasis. More generally, a Gene Ontology analysis of genes meeting an ANOVA p-value criterion of 0.05 for an effect of s12720356 genotype demonstrated significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) functional enrichment for “lymphocyte activation” and “T-cell activation” (Table S11). Finally, in support for functional relevance in the skin, we assessed the possible expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) properties of rs12720356 encoding I684S on our RNA-seq-based gene expression dataset of skin samples (Table S12). The top hit in this eQTL analysis was GCSAM (germinal center associated signaling and motility, aka GCET2, Gene ID: 257144, eQTL p = 2.3 × 10−5), which manifests strongly biased expression not only in lymph nodes, but also in skin (ref. Entrez Gene). Collectively, these suggestive findings merit further analysis in a larger sample.\n\nIn this study, we selected individuals for functional studies based on 3-SNP haplotype-based genotypes instead of single-SNP genotypes. As shown in Fig. 1, rs34536443C is found on only one haplotype (CAA), whereas rs34536443G can belong to two different haplotypes—the ancestral GAC haplotype or the derived GAA haplotype—which carry different odds ratios in our study. More importantly, we utilized heterozygotes for the minor alleles at rs34536443 and rs12720356, rather than homozygotes. It is possible that by analyzing heterozygotes, we may have been able to capture an inhibitory effect of the TYK2 684S variant on its “wild-type” 684I counterpart, in the context of TYK2 homodimers bound to the IL-12 receptor. The existence of such homodimers in T-cells is strongly suggested by pharmacological evidence. Our major findings complement those of Dendrou et al., who found a significant reduction in STAT4 phosphorylation in CD4 and CD8 memory T-cells in rs34536443 C/C vs. G/G homozygotes. There were several differences between the two studies with regards to the experimental protocol, which might account for the differences in results. We stimulated whole PBMC, whereas Dendrou et al. stimulated purified CD3+ T-cells. We utilized CD3/CD28 beads for 72 hr followed by 1 hr of IL-12 stimulation, whereas Dendrou et al. activated with phytohemaglutinin for 72 hr followed by IL-2 for 24 hr prior to stimulation with IL-12 for 15 min. It is worth noting that in both our studies and those of Dendrou et al., hypofunctional TYK2 alleles, which are predicted to be functionally damaging to TYK2 signaling, are associated with a protective effect against psoriasis.\n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate a significant decrease in STAT4 phosphorylation in GCA/GAC heterozygotes (bearing one copy",

Compared to controls, patients with AMD were older (78.3 versus 75.6 years, p=0.009), with a higher proportion of women (72.9% versus 56%, p=0.003). Overall, C. pneumoniae infection was common (69.2%), whereas C. trachomatis and C. psittaci were less prevalent (7.4% and 3.3%, respectively). There was no difference in age between seropositive and seronegative patients, for C. pneumoniae (78.1±8.1 versus 78.6±8.6, p=0.688) and C. trachomatis (80.1±6.3 versus 78.1±8.4, p=0.344), although patients seropositive for C. psittaci were older (84.0±8.0 versus 78.0±8.2, p=0.044). There was also no difference in age between patients with early versus late AMD (Table 2).\n\nChlamydia and AMD\n\nUnivariate analysis demonstrated no statistical association between IgG seropositive status for all three Chlamydia species and AMD status. A subgroup analysis of the AMD group also demonstrated no association between Chlamydia species seropositivity and AMD severity (early or late; Table 2).\n\nChlamydia and CFH genotype\n\nNo association was found between Chlamydia species seropositivity and CFH Y402H polymorphism, either when comparing genotypes (TT versus CT versus CC) or the presence or absence of the risk allele (C; Table 3). There was also no association between Chlamydia species seropositivity and AMD status or severity in those carrying the CFH Y402H risk allele (C; Table 4).\n\nChlamydia and HTRA1\n\nWe also looked at patients carrying at least one HTRA1 rs11200638 risk allele (A) to explore any association with Chlamydia seropositivity status and AMD. There was no association with Chlamydia species seropositivity and AMD status or severity in this group (Table 5).\n\nChlamydia, CFH genotype, and AMD\n\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis was then performed to identify covariates that could predict AMD status or severity. C. trachomatis and C. psittaci status was not included as covariates since IgG+ status was of low prevalence overall. When covariates were restricted to C. pneumoniae IgG status (positive versus negative) and CFH Y402H genotype (CC versus CT versus TT), C. pneumoniae IgG status was not predictive of AMD status (p=0.842) or AMD severity (p=0.078). The outcome was similar when the presence of the CFH Y402H risk allele (C: present versus absent) was used as a covariate instead of the CFH genotype.\n\nControlling for multiple variables (C. pneumoniae IgG status, age, gender, BMI, CFH Y402H genotype, HTRA1 rs11200638 genotype), logistic regression analysis indicated predictors for AMD status included increased BMI (p=0.015, OR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01–1.14), increased age (p=0.015, OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.08), female gender (p=0.011, OR 2.04, 95% CI: 1.18–3.51), and HTRA1 rs11200638 homozygous (AA) status (p=1.45×10−4, OR 11.05, 95% CI 3.20–38.17). Again, C. pneumoniae IgG+ve status (p=0.768) was not a predictor of AMD status.\n\nWe then performed logistic regression to predict whether these same covariates (C. pneumoniae IgG status, age, gender, BMI, CFH Y402H genotype, HTRA1 rs11200638 genotype) were predictors of AMD severity. The only positive association in this model was CFH Y402H heterozygous (CT) status, associated with late AMD (p=0.006, OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.42–8.27).\n\nAppendix 1.

    "content": "Results\n\nIdentification of ALK R1275Q Neoepitopes Using ProTECT\n\nA reduced version of our software, ProTECT (Figure 1), was initially run on a batch of six primary:relapsed NBL sample pairs from the TARGET cohort. We find at least one neoepitope-generating mutation persisting in the relapsed tumor for five of six patients (Table S1 and Supplementary Data S1 in Supplementary Material). Among these are two well-known hotspot mutations, NRAS Q61K and ALK R1275Q (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). We predicted two HLA-B*15:01-restricted decamer (MAQDIYRASY and AQDIYRASYY) and one nonamer (AQDIYRASY) neoepitopes arising from ALK R1275Q in sample TARGET-30-PARHAM. The predicted binding affinities are better than 0.55, 0.85, and 2.1%, respectively, relative to all peptides in a background training set (the top 5% ranked peptides are considered true binders by our method). While the peptide beginning at M1273 is predicted to be the top binder, the two epitopes beginning at A1274 are more promising from an immunological perspective since they are predicted to be significantly better binders to HLA-B*15:01 than their parental self-antigens ARDIYRASYY (10.75 percentile score) and ARDIYRASY (35 percentile score).\n\nUsing the full version of the ProTECT software (manuscript in preparation), we expanded our study to 100 primary NBL samples in the TARGET cohort to collect more complete statistics on ALK R1275Q-derived neoepitopes, and to identify other recurrent neoepitopes in NBL (Table S1 and Supplementary Data S2 and S3 in Supplementary Material). We identify four additional samples harboring ALK R1275Q (TARGET-30-PANWRR, -PANXJL, -PAPTFZ, and -PAPTLV). None of these samples express HLA-B*15:01, but sample PAPTFZ displays a close relative, HLA-B*15:03 that is predicted to bind ARDIYRASYY and ARDIYRASY with scores of 2.2 and 4.7%, respectively. Two samples (PANXJL and PAPTLV) express the high-frequency HLA-A*02:01 (20% in Caucasian populations), where an ALK R1275Q nonamer (GMAQDIYRA) is predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01 with a 1.4% score.\n\nAll but six of the 100 samples harbor one or more non-synonymous neoepitope with low percentile scores for at least one expressed HLA allele. Among these we identify other recurrent mutations, including the ALK mutation F1174L/I/C, present in 3/2/1 samples, respectively, and a ZNF717 mutation (Q716), present in three samples (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). One sample in the cohort expresses NRAS Q61K, an activating mutation commonly found in melanoma, thyroid, and colorectal cancers. Finally, the NRAS-derived neoepitope ILDTAGKEEY arising from a single mutation (Q61K) is predicted to bind the common HLA-A*01:01 allele with a statistically significant score of 0.35%. Notably, the same HLA-A*01:01/ILDTAGKEEY interaction identified by our method has been previously shown to elicit a specific T cell response using a melanoma cell line.\n\nALK Tumor Neoantigens Form p/MHC Complexes with Distinct Stabilities In Vitro\n\nThe results obtained from ProTECT analysis provide a range of therapeutically relevant neoantigen/HLA interactions to validate and characterize using biophysical and structural methods. Given the extensive genetic evidence supporting a role for ALK mutations in NBL tumors, we chose to pursue further the interaction between ALK R1275Q and HLA-B*15:01. We prepared recombinant HLA-B*15:01 bound to the two ALK-derived neoantigens, a nonamer (AQDIYRASY) and a decamer (AQDIYRASYY). As a control, we attempted to prepare HLA-B*15:01 with the self-antigen (ARDIYRASY), which is predicted to have a >10-fold reduced binding affinity for the HLA. Peptide/MHC samples were refolded from purified Escherichia coli inclusion bodies in the presence of 10-fold molar excess peptide using standard methods and purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC traces of the nonamer and decamer samples show three distinct peaks corresponding to protein aggregate (22.8 min), p/MHC complex (29.5 min), and free β2m (42.7 min) (Figure 2A). Notably, the sample refolded using the self-antigen peptide shows only two peaks in the chromatogram, none of which contain non-aggregated p/MHC molecules (Figure 2A, green trace), further suggesting that the affinity of the self-antigen is insufficient to promote the formation of a stable complex with the HLA.\n\nTo confirm the presence of the neoepitopes in the two MHC samples, we performed liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy (LC–MS). LC–MS reveals a high relative abundance of the correct peptide in each sample, with observed masses of 1,086.70 and 1,249.71 Da, which agree well with the expected masses of the nonamer and decamer, respectively (Figures 2B,C). Thus, we confirm binding of the two tumor neoepitopes to",

Thus, we confirm binding of the two tumor neoepitopes to recombinant HLA-B*15:01 prepared through in vitro refolding. To further characterize the resulting p/MHC molecules, we used a differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay, which can accurately assess kinetic stability. According to this technique, properly folded class I p/MHC complexes show melting temperatures (Tm) from 37 to 63°C, which correlate with predicted IC50 values in the micromolar to nanomolar range. Here, both neoantigen p/MHC samples show a clear unfolding transition with a highly reproducible Tm of 53.4°C for the nonamer and 59.3°C for the decamer complex (Figure 2D), suggesting that the decamer forms a higher affinity complex with HLA-B*15:01. Such a difference in thermal stabilities of the p/MHC complexes together with previous observations that peptide length influences its conformation within a fixed-length groove is consistent with a hypothesis that the two peptides are displayed via distinct binding modes, as previously reported for nonamer and decamer peptides sampling unique conformations within an MHC groove.\n\nStructural Plasticity within the MHC Peptide-Binding Groove Enables Distinct Neoantigen Conformations\n\nTo elucidate the structural basis underlying the distinct stabilities observed for the two ALK neoepitopes and to further characterize peptide features displayed to TCRs we solved the X-ray structures of the nonamer (HLA-B*15:01/β2m/AQDIYRASY) (PDB ID 5TXS) and the decamer complex (HLA-B*15:01/β2m/AQDIYRASYY) (PDB ID 5VZ5). The nonamer complex crystallized in the P212121 space group at a resolution of 1.7 Å, while the decamer complex crystallized in the P6122 space group at a resolution of 2.6 Å (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). The nonamer peptide adopts a canonical extended conformation promoted by the N-terminal (Ala1, Gln2) and C-terminal (Tyr9) anchors, which are deeply embedded within A/B, and F-pockets of the HLA groove (Figures 3A,B), respectively. This anchoring results in a “curved” conformation, where the backbone of residues from Asp3 to Ser8 is pushed toward the upper part of the groove while the remaining residues are maintained within the C, D, and E pockets (Figure 3B). A survey of previously deposited HLA-B*15:01-restricted antigens in the PDB (LEKARGSTY derived from Epstein–Barr virus, PDB ID 1XR8; ILGPPGSVY derived from human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme-E2, PDB ID 1XR9; VQQESSFVM derived from SARS coronavirus, PDB ID 3C9N) reveals other nonamer epitopes consistently in extended conformations, in agreement with the conformation of the ALK nonamer neoepitope in our X-ray structure (Figures S4A–D in Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the overall architecture of the B*15:01-binding groove is similar between the different structures with heavy atom backbone RMSDs of less than 1 Å (Figure S4E in Supplementary Material). Comparison between the peptide amino acid sequences reveals excellent agreement with the established HLA-B*15:01-binding motifs, where LMQ/AEISTV and FY/LM are preferred/tolerated in anchor positions 2 and 9, respectively (Figures S4F,G in Supplementary Material). Thus, the X-ray structure of our ALK-derived nonamer neoepitope is consistent with established structural features in the PDB, suggesting a trend where the peptide backbone conformation is defined by its length and anchor motifs.\n\nGenerally, peptides of length greater than nine amino acids either bulge further out of the binding groove or form a “zig-zag” conformation. However, in our decamer complex structure (Figures 3C,D), the peptide adopts a short 310 helical backbone conformation from Ile4 to Ala7, as confirmed by an inspection of φ/ψ backbone dihedral angles (Figure S1A in Supplementary Material). Notably, while the N-terminal anchor residues are identical in the nonamer and decamer peptide, Tyr10 of the decamer replaces Tyr9 of the nonamer as the C-terminal anchor residue in a similar conformation (Figures 3B,D). The accommodation of a longer peptide sequence within the fixed-size MHC groove is thus achieved through the formation of a more compact 310 helix for the decamer, relative to the extended nonamer backbone. In addition, the 310 helix buries Arg6 further into the MHC groove and creates an amphipathic structure where Ile4, Tyr5, Ser8, and Tyr9 are oriented toward the solvent (Figure 3D). A structural superposition of the nonamer and decamer peptides (2.7 Å backbone heavy atom RMSD) highlights the changes in residues that are oriented toward the solvent, suggesting that the two epitopes display very different surface features for interactions with TCRs (Figures 3E–G).\n\nThe compaction of the peptide backbone in the decamer structure",

A structural superposition of the nonamer and decamer peptides (2.7 Å backbone heavy atom RMSD) highlights the changes in residues that are oriented toward the solvent, suggesting that the two epitopes display very different surface features for interactions with TCRs (Figures 3E–G).\n\nThe compaction of the peptide backbone in the decamer structure is accompanied by structural adaptations of MHC residues in the peptide-binding groove. In particular, in the decamer complex the HLA α2 helix undergoes a significant widening involving a 5.1 Å displacement of the Cα atom of Arg151. This movement is driven by a change in orientation of Arg151, which points toward the solvent in the nonamer versus toward the groove in the decamer complex (Figures S2A,B in Supplementary Material), and the burying of Arg6 further toward the floor of the groove. Thus, the addition of a C-terminal Tyr in the peptide sequence drastically alters the tertiary structure of the HLA complex, driven by a widely different peptide conformation that can be accommodated through conformational plasticity within a malleable MHC groove.\n\nKey structural parameters extracted from our crystallographic analysis provide insights into the increased stability of the decamer/HLA complex. Notably, the buried surface area (BSA) between HLA-B*15:01 and the decamer peptide is 1,986 Å2, relative to 800 Å2 in the nonamer structure. To further dissect different structural features for their contributions to p/MHC stability, we analyzed all polar (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and electrostatic interactions) and hydrophobic interactions involving HLA residues (Figure S5 and Table S3 in Supplementary Material). Specifically, the decamer peptide forms additional intra-peptide hydrogen bonds as a result of the more compacted 310 helix conformation. In addition, the decamer participates in 25 polar and 21 hydrophobic interactions with the MHC residues, while the nonamer forms 26 polar but only 11 hydrophobic interactions with the groove (Figure S5A in Supplementary Material). Specifically, Asp3 and Arg6 of the decamer peptide extend further into the groove, forming additional contacts with HLA side chains (Figures S5B,C in Supplementary Material). Our structural analysis suggests that an increase in the total number of intra-peptide hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic packing interactions, consistently with an increase in BSA brought on by the more compact 310 helical conformation, leads to an improved stability of the decamer complex, as confirmed independently by our DSF experiments (Figure 2B).\n\nStructural Exclusion of the Self-antigen from the HLA-B*15:01 Groove\n\nTo further evaluate the potential immunogenicity of the ALK R1275Q neoepitopes, we compared their affinity for HLA-B*15:01 relative to the self-peptide (ARDIYRASY). Formation of a stable HLA complex displaying the self-peptide would compromise the therapeutic relevance of any related neoantigen, due to immune tolerance mechanisms that limit the repertoire of responsive T cells. Preliminary attempts to refold HLA-B*15:01 using a synthetic nonamer peptide with the parental ALK sequence did not result in efficient p/MHC formation, suggesting low binding affinity, likely in the micromolar range (Figure 2A, green trace). To further explore the basis of this exclusion we performed structural modeling of the self-peptide/HLA-B*15:01 complex, using our solved X-ray structure of the nonamer complex as a template. We find that performing the reverse Gln to Arg substitution leads to steric hindrance between the longer Arg2 side chain and residues of the MHC-binding groove (Figure S6A in Supplementary Material). Despite a careful consideration of all possible Arg side-chain rotamers, significant clashes remain with Ser67 on the α1 helix, as well as with Ala24, Met45 on the floor of the MHC groove (Figure S6A in Supplementary Material). As expected from the conservation of peptide residue anchors in the A- and B-pockets, we observe similar clashes when the self-decamer is modeled with HLA-B*15:01. By contrast, the neoepitope Gln2 side chain fits well into the B-pocket, forming an additional hydrogen bond Tyr9 from the HLA heavy chain (Figure S6B in Supplementary Material, cyan dotted line). Finally, we performed detailed structure modeling calculations using simultaneous optimization of the peptide backbone in addition to the side-chain degrees of freedom and ranked the calculated affinities of the three peptides for HLA-B*15:01 according to a physically realistic energy function. The self-antigen complexes yield the least favorable binding energies, followed by the nonamer, and finally the decamer complex (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). Thus, our structural analysis is highly consistent with our in vitro results, i.e., that the self-peptide is excluded from binding, in sharp contrast with the nonamer and decamer neoepitopes which form tight complexes with the HLA.\n\nEvaluating the HLA-Binding Repertoire Using Comparative Modeling Calculations\n\nA patient’s HLA haplotype plays a major role in determining the outcome of targeted cancer immunotherapies. Therefore, toward expanding the range of individuals that could mount a T cell response to ALK R1275Q neoepitopes, we evaluated the potential of other HLAs to display the two peptides in silico. Here, we developed and applied a high-throughput approach which exploits the availability of our high-resolution X-ray structures for the two neoepitopes to simultaneously predict peptide/HLA interactions and surface features of",

Therefore, toward expanding the range of individuals that could mount a T cell response to ALK R1275Q neoepitopes, we evaluated the potential of other HLAs to display the two peptides in silico. Here, we developed and applied a high-throughput approach which exploits the availability of our high-resolution X-ray structures for the two neoepitopes to simultaneously predict peptide/HLA interactions and surface features of peptide residues poised for interactions with TCRs. First, we selected a non-redundant set of 2,904 HLA alleles (885 HLA-A, 1,405 HLA-B, and 614 HLA-C unique sequences) from the EMBL-EBI database. We then carried out detailed Rosetta comparative modeling calculations for each allele, using our experimentally determined HLA-B*15:01 structures for the nonamer and decamer ALK peptides as templates (Figure 4). In contrast to previous structure-based peptide/HLA modeling methods which use a flexible peptide docking approach, we used a fixed-peptide backbone threading approach followed by energy minimization of the interacting peptide and HLA residues to drastically confine the docking degrees of freedom. Our approach was motivated the observation that the peptide backbone conformation shows minimal variance (less than 1.5 Å RMSD) in all nonamer/HLA-B*15:01 structures reported in the PDB (Figure S4E in Supplementary Material). Using this strategy, we extracted highly reproducible binding energies for both the nonamer and decamer peptides, which are maintained in extended and 310 helical conformations, respectively, in the resulting models (Figure S7 in Supplementary Material). As expected, the HLA-B*15 alleles rank systematically among the top binders, indicating a high degree of groove complementarity to both peptides (Figure 5; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, purple). Among those, the HLA-B*15:84 allele shows the lowest binding energy for the decamer (Figure 5A, black circle), whereas the HLA-B*15:107 allele shows the lowest binding energy for the nonamer (Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, black circle). A total of 116 HLA alleles from all A, B, and C types exhibit lower binding energies for both the nonamer and decamer peptides than our initial HLA-B*15:01 structural templates (Figure 5A; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, red square), suggesting the potential for a broader HLA display repertoire.\n\nTo elucidate a sequence bias for specific residues in the HLA-binding groove that consistently yield more favorable interactions with the two peptides, we analyzed the average binding energy as a function of sequence identity score, calculated relative to the best binding allele for each peptide (Figure 4). As a negative control, we computed the binding energy for a mock HLA allele in which all residues in the MHC-binding groove are mutated to Ala. As expected, the mock polyAla HLA exhibits a low binding affinity (i.e., high-binding energy) to the peptide and is distant from the best binding allele (Figure 5; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, green triangle, top left). We observe an evident correlation between the computed binding energies and sequence similarity to the top binder. Our approach additionally allows us to decompose residue specific contributions to overall binding energy for each peptide–HLA combination. We find a clear trend for both the nonamer and decamer peptides with a set of HLA alleles where a bulk of the binding energy is provided by the “anchor” positions (Figures S11A,B in Supplementary Material). By contrast, the mock polyAla HLA exhibits considerably higher binding energy across the entire peptide length (Figures S11A,B in Supplementary Material). To elucidate key sequence features that allow the peptides to be accommodated in the MHC groove, we derived a sequence profile among good binders for the two neoepitopes. Such features are highlighted in the Kullback–Leibler sequence logo, which reveals preferred residues in the HLA peptide-binding groove (Figure 5B; Figure S8B in Supplementary Material). According to this metric, highly invariant residues in the MHC-binding groove should play an essential role in mediating peptide/MHC interactions, as they are consistently observed in HLA alleles that exhibit high affinity binding. A close inspection of our structural models for the nonamer and decamer bound to a common allele in our data set, HLA-A*01:01, reveals similar polar contacts, primarily in the A-, B-, and F-pockets, that correlate well with the positions of invariant MHC residues (Figures 5C,D; Figures S8C,D in Supplementary Material). Specifically, both the nonamer and decamer C-terminal anchors employ a similar interaction pattern in the F-pocket with conserved Thr, Lys, Trp, and Tyr residues of the MHC (Figures 5B,D; Figure S8B,D in Supplementary Material).\n\nTo test the validity of our structure-based simulations, we performed in vitro refolding of the ALK-derived nonamer and decamer peptides with HLA-A*01:01. This allele was chosen because it is a high-frequency allele in multiple populations worldwide and has been previously shown to form stable recombinant p/MHC complexes for structural characterization. As observed in our previous experiments with HLA-B*15:01 (Figure 2A), refolding of HLA-A*01:01 with decamer or nonamer peptide results in a stable p/MHC complex (Figures S8E and S9A in Supplementary Material). Further characterization of the purified complex reveals a thermal stability of 47.9°C for the decamer (Figure",

As observed in our previous experiments with HLA-B*15:01 (Figure 2A), refolding of HLA-A*01:01 with decamer or nonamer peptide results in a stable p/MHC complex (Figures S8E and S9A in Supplementary Material). Further characterization of the purified complex reveals a thermal stability of 47.9°C for the decamer (Figure S9B in Supplementary Material) and 46.7°C for the nonamer (Figure S8F in Supplementary Material), suggesting that both ALK neoepitopes have a lower affinity for HLA-A*01:01 compared with HLA-B*15:01 (Figure 2D, 59.3°C), consistently with our binding energy calculations (Figure 5A; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material). Although certain HLA and H2 MHC alleles have been previously reported to yield partially folded, peptide-free molecules with measurable thermal stabilities, control refolding experiments performed without peptide for each of our HLA alleles failed to yield a stable complex. Finally, to conclusively test the atomic features predicted by our simulations, we determined the X-ray structure of decamer complex HLA-A*01:01/β2m/AQDIYRASYY (PDB ID 6AT9). The decamer complex crystallized in the P32221space group at a resolution of 2.9 Å (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). Inspection of crystallographic φ/ψ dihedral angles reveals that the peptide backbone also adopts a short 310 helix conformation when bound to HLA-A*01:01, suggesting that the peptide length is the main determinant of its conformation in the groove, and further justifying our fixed-backbone modeling approach (Figure S9F in Supplementary Material). The peptide conformation in the X-ray structure shows excellent agreement with our Rosetta model (1.1 backbone heavy atom RMSD), with several high-resolution features predicted by the model are confirmed by the X-ray, including polar contacts within both the A- and F-pockets of the MHC groove (Figures 5C–F; Figure S12 in Supplementary Material). Specifically, the side-chain hydroxyl group of the peptide Tyr10 is in contact with the same Tyr, Lys, and Trp side-chain atoms from the F-pocket (Figures 5D,F). Finally, in comparison with the X-ray structure of the same peptide bound to HLA-B*15:01, the side chain of Arg6 is flipped outwards from the groove when bound to HLA-A*01:01 altering the peptide surface displayed to TCRs (Figures S9D,E in Supplementary Material). Thus, our independent X-ray structure corroborates the trend observed in our structure-based binding energy simulations and further supports the potential for other HLA molecules to display the recurrent ALK neoepitopes with unique TCR interaction properties.\n\nThe Two ALK-Derived Neoepitopes Are Recognized by CD8+ T Cells\n\nGiven the unique conformations and surface features observed for the nonamer and decamer peptides, we sought to determine whether the two altered-self (i.e., mutated) neoantigens could be recognized by CD8+ T cells using a MHC tetramer staining assay followed by multichannel flow cytometry analysis. We hypothesized that an HLA-matched donor would be able to recognize altered-self neoepitopes in the periphery, as long as the peptide adopts a conformation that can potentiate interactions with TCRs. To test this, we acquired PBMCs from two HLA-B*15:01-matched healthy donors. For each peptide, we performed a double staining experiment using HLA-B*15:01 tetramers conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC) or phycoerythrin (PE), toward identification of T cells that recognize each neoepitope. Final cell sorting using fluorescence-based detection results in identification of double positive populations with a total of 0.012% CD8+ T cells reactive to the nonamer (Figure S13A in Supplementary Material), and 0.024% reactive to the decamer epitope (Figure S13B in Supplementary Material). Notably, these findings were very similar between two independent staining experiments using PBMCs from individual donors (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material). As a control, we additionally performed staining experiments using tetramers made for HLA-B*15:01 complexed with an immunodominant SARS coronavirus-derived epitope (VQQESSFVM). For double staining experiments with HLA-B*15:01/SARS tetramers, we observe double positive populations corresponding to 0.007 and 0.014% reactive CD8+ T cells (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material). Finally, simultaneous staining experiments using nonamer/HLA-B*15:01-PE and decamer/HLA-B*15:01-PE tetramers did not uncover populations of CD8+ T cells that recognized both epitopes (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material). Thus, CD8+ T cells are able to recognize both neoepitopes with nominal frequencies that are comparable to that of a known immunodominant epitope.",

The human CD70 ectodomain contains a TNF homology domain and a stalk region. To minimize flexibility of CD27:CD70 protein complex for crystallization, we designed constructs encoding only a portion of the extracellular domains of these two binding partners (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1, A and B). To simplify the carbohydrate modification, we expressed both constructs in the presence of kifunensine and minimized the sugar modification by subsequent endoglycosidase (EndoH) digestion. Human CD27 protein could be readily deglycosylated with no significant aggregation (Fig. S2B). However, EndoH digestion of human CD70 protein resulted in aggregation (Fig. S2A). Therefore, we pursued structure determination using deglycosylated CD27 in complex with glycosylated CD70. SEC (size-exclusion chromatography) and CGE (capillary gel electrophoresis) indicated that deglycosylated CD27 and glycosylated CD70 were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2, A and B). Molecular characterization by aSEC (analytical size-exclusion chromatography) suggested that CD70 forms a stable homotrimer and CD27 is a monomer in solution (Fig. 1C).\n\nTo assess the interaction of purified CD27 and CD70, we prepared mixtures of purified constructs in a 1:1 monomer molar ratio and assayed for complexation by monitoring the appearance of higher-molecular-weight species by aSEC. When CD27 and CD70 proteins were combined and incubated, we observed peaks corresponding to each individual component, indicating that the affinity between CD27 and CD70 does not support formation of a stable complex in solution (Fig. 1C). We therefore quantified the binding affinity between CD27 and CD70 by SPR (surface plasmon resonance). CD70 binds to glycosylated and deglycosylated CD27 with a KD (equilibrium dissociation constant) of 134 ± 1 nM (average ka = 3.23 × 104 M−1s−1; kd = 4.33 × 10−3 s−1) and 118 ± 1 nM (average ka = 5.17 × 104 M−1s−1; kd = 6.08 × 10−3 s−1), respectively (Fig. 1, D and E). From the experimentally measured dissociation rate, the calculated half-life for these interactions is 2.67 and 1.90 min, respectively. This short half-life compared with the timescale of the SEC separation (more than 10 min) explains the lack of detectable complex by SEC. The binding affinities of glycosylated and deglycosylated CD27 to CD70 are similar, suggesting that the CD27 carbohydrate modifications do not significantly affect the interaction.\n\nHuman CD27:CD70 complex exhibits a 3:3 stoichiometry in the crystal\n\nCrystallization of a complex between CD27 and CD70 was achieved by combining the individually purified components at a 1:1 monomer molar ratio and concentrating the sample prior to crystallization screens. We obtained crystals that diffracted to 2.69 Å with a space group of I222 (Table 1). The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a single copy of the CD27:CD70 assembly composed of three CD27 monomers binding to one centrally located noncrystallographic CD70 homotrimer (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2C). Each CD27 monomer engages along the groove formed by two adjacent CD70 monomers. The three CD27 molecules in the asymmetric unit align very closely, with aligned Cα RMSDs ranging between 0.19 and 0.22 Å. Comparison of the structures of CD27 with previously determined CD27:Fab (fragment antigen binding) structures (PDB entries: 5Tl5, 5TLJ, 5TLK) shows minimal structural deviations within individual CRD domains. Moderate inter-CRD motion was observed when aligning the structures of CD27 from the CD27:CD70 complex and the CD27:Fab complex from the PDB entry 5Tl5, with a CRD1-CRD2 hinge difference of 3.4 degrees and a CRD2-CRD3 hinge difference of 10.7 degrees (Fig. 2B). One N-linked glycan distant from the CD70-binding interface is observed on N95 residue within CRD2 of CD27 (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2, C and H), which is consistent with our SPR results indicating that CD27 glycans do not contribute significantly to the interaction with CD70.\n\nThe CD70 homotrimer resembles the classical TNF ligand trimeric assembly. The biologically active CD70 is formed by three protomers, with each protomer adopting a “jelly-roll” fold built around two β sheets (Fig. 2, C and D). Comparison of the CD70 homotrimer with representative TNF ligand structures demonstrates that CD70 adopts a “blooming flower” trimeric arrangement similar to OX40L (Fig. S3C).

Comparison of the CD70 homotrimer with representative TNF ligand structures demonstrates that CD70 adopts a “blooming flower” trimeric arrangement similar to OX40L (Fig. S3C). Electron density corresponding to N-linked glycan modifications extends from CD70 residues N63 and N170 on each protomer (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2, C and E–G). A region of density extending from O6 of the proximal N-acetylglucosamine moiety on residue N63 is consistent with a core fucosylation modification (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2, E and F). Superimposing the structure of CD70 protomer with a classical TNF ligand FasL shows a similar structural organization with an RMSD of 1.08 Å on 64 aligned Cα (Fig. S2D). Alignment of the scaffold β strands of CD70 and FasL shows even closer structural similarity with an RMSD of 0.64 Å on 35 aligned Cα (Fig. S2D). The most prominent structural differences between CD70 and FasL are present in the connecting loops between β strands.\n\nA region of positive density along the CD70 trimer axis was identified. As mentioned above, the trimer is related by a threefold noncrystallographic symmetry; hence this additional density cannot be attributed to artifact of data processing. Based on the features of the density and the composition of the crystallization solution, a Tris molecule was modeled at this location (Fig. 2, E–G). This Tris molecule forms hydrogen bonds with each CD70 monomer, and it may be possible that the energetic stability of the trimer is strengthened by the contribution of these interactions. Further investigation into the effect of buffer components on CD70 homotrimer stability was warranted, and so differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed. The melting temperature of CD70 was found to increase when Tris was present, consistent with an energetic stabilization of the CD70 homotrimer upon binding of this small molecule (Fig. 2H). Interestingly, structures of TL1a and mouse TNFα also contain small molecules (glycerol, Tris, and isopropanol, respectively) bound along the ligand homotrimer axis. It may be of interest to assess activity or stability of these TNF family ligands in the presence and absence of these small molecules to ascertain the functional relevance, if any, of these hypothetical binding sites. As an example of the principle that ligand binding at the homotrimer axis may alter the stability of the macromolecular complex, a small-molecule SPD-304 was identified to bind a similar site in TNFα. SPD-304 binds to preformed TNFα trimer and induces a subunit rotation that displaces one TNFα monomer from the complex. Our structure provides a model that may be used to design a similar strategy to inhibit CD70 activity.\n\nThe unique disulfide bond of CD70\n\nThere are two pairs of intramolecular disulfide bonds observed in the structure of CD70. One disulfide bond is formed between residues C115 and C151 located on CD loop and EF loop, respectively (Fig. 2D). This disulfide bond is conserved among classical TNF ligands such as TNFα, LIGHT, TL1A, and FasL, etc. (Fig. S3A). The other disulfide bond, involving C168 on G β strand and C133 located on the DE loop, is unique to CD70 and was not observed in the previously determined TNF ligand structures (Fig. 2D). This disulfide bond is unusual in its position, which lies on the surface of the CD70 polypeptide (Fig. 2D) with 76.9% of the total surface area of the two side chain sulfur atoms exposed to solvent, except for the involvement of an additional posttranslational modification.\n\nThis disulfide bond is shielded by the N-linked glycan extending from N170, with the two N-acetylglucosamine moieties positioned directly over the disulfide bond (Fig. 2D). The disulfide-bonded cysteines and the observed shielding of N-linked glycosylation site are conserved in mouse CD70 (Fig. S3A), which is to be expected for structural features that are required for protein stability. Mutation of the glycosylation residues or the cysteines resulted in failure of protein expression and purification in Expi293 cells (data not shown). While the C133-C168 disulfide does not directly interact with CD27, it is likely that the conformational constraints imposed on the DE loop by the disulfide bond impact the CD70-CD27 interaction.\n\nBinding interface between CD70 and CD27\n\nEach CD27 molecule interacts with two CD70 monomers, forming an interface that buries a total of 2440 Å2 of solvent accessible surface area from both CD27 and CD70. Two adjacent CD70 protomers contribute similar surface areas. For example, 653 Å2 of surface area from CD27 chain F engages CD70 chain A and 707 Å2 interacts with CD70 chain B (Fig. 3, A and B). Domains CRD2 and CRD3 of CD27 dominate the CD70-binding interface, with only a single residue from CRD1, F48, engaged in a van der Waals interaction with CD70 (Fig. 3C).\n\nEx",

Domains CRD2 and CRD3 of CD27 dominate the CD70-binding interface, with only a single residue from CRD1, F48, engaged in a van der Waals interaction with CD70 (Fig. 3C).\n\nExamination of the recognition interface between CD27 and CD70 reveals atomic-level interactions contributing to the receptor:ligand complex. There are six ionic interactions observed between one CD27 receptor and its two interacting CD70 protomers (Fig. 3C). Residue E82 of CD27 contributes to two salt bridges: one with R83 from one CD70 protomer, the second with R138 from the adjacent CD70 protomer (Figs. 3C and 4, B and C). The other four salt bridges are formed by pairwise interactions between four CD27 acidic residues with four CD70 basic residue (Figs. 3C and 4, B–D). In addition to the ionic interactions, a network of 16 potential hydrogen bonds is observed within the recognition interface (Fig. 3C). Nine hydrogen bonds are formed between one CD27 (chain F) and one CD70 protomer (chain A), with the remaining seven hydrogen bonds formed between CD27 (chain F) and the adjacent CD70 protomer (chain B). All polar contacts including salt bridges and hydrogen bonds involve residues contributed by CRD2 and CRD3 of CD27.\n\nEpitope mapping of CD27 and CD70\n\nTo validate the atomic interactions observed in the structure of CD27:CD70 complex, we applied rational mutagenesis targeting key structural features of the complex and measured the binding of resulting muteins to their cognate protein partner by SPR. To do so, we designed and expressed 15 muteins of CD27 and 31 muteins of CD70. Most mutations tested were single substitutions, with the exception of two double substitutions developed to eliminate a disulfide bond by removing both cysteines forming the bond. Mutations had varying effects on the CD27:CD70 interaction.\n\nFirstly, several engineered substitutions resulted in loss of expression. One N-linked glycosylation site in CD70 (N63, T65) was found to be essential for expression. In addition, removal of the CD70 surface-exposed disulfide between C133 and C168 greatly impaired CD70 expression, indicating that this structural disulfide is critical for the stability of the ligand (Fig. 4A). Mutagenesis of the N-glycosylation site N170Q decreases expression of CD70 and decreases binding to CD27 (Table 2). This site does not directly interact with CD27, but the inhibition of binding may result from solvent exposure of the C133-C168 disulfide bond and a subsequent increase in the lability of the bond, which stabilizes part of the CD27-binding interface (Fig. 4A). In CD70, substitutions of either P135 or D165 diminished expression and these two substitutions are proximal to the C133-C168 disulfide and enforce mainchain geometry around the bond (Fig. 4A). Disruption of the conserved TNF ligand family disulfide, C115-C151 in CD70, still led to protein expression, but this mutated variant did not bind CD27 (Table 2). Mutagenesis of the N-linked glycosylation site of CD27, branching from N95, did not significantly affect CD70 binding (Table 3). Consistent with studies using enzymatically deglycosylated CD27, the mutation N95A did not impair CD70 binding.\n\nOur mutagenesis studies confirmed the importance of electrostatic interactions in the binding between CD27 and CD70. Charge-reversal substitutions for either E82 in CD27 or R83 in CD70 ablated measurable binding interaction, indicating the importance of this ionic interaction to the total binding energetics (Tables 2 and 3, Fig. 4B). In an even more conservative approach, alanine substitution at either position resulted in loss of binding, as did the R83K mutation of CD70 (Table 2). Position E82 in CD27 also simultaneously interacts with R138 from the neighboring CD70 monomer, which is coordinated by engagement of D74 residue of CD27 (Fig. 4B). This aspartate forms hydrogen bonds with residue S137 of CD70, further stabilizing the interaction (Fig. 4B). While S137A and S137K substitutions of CD70 have little effect on binding, the affinity of CD70-S137E binding to CD27 decreased by approximately fourfold due to an increase in the dissociation rate resulting from introduction of electrostatic repulsion with residue D74 of CD27 (Table 2 and Table S1). D74A mutant of CD27 showed weaker binding affinity to CD70 as indicated by heterogeneous kinetic binding curve (Table 3). R30 alanine substitution in CD27 resulted in approximately threefold weaker binding affinity by decreasing the complex association rate, possibly by destabilizing the conformation of H75 and D74 in CD27 (Fig. 4B and Table 3).\n\nPositions S83 and S70 on CD27 are proximal to residue E82 on CD27 and form hydrogen bonds with residues Q61 and A80 of CD70, respectively (Fig. 4C). Alanine substitutions of either position 83 on CD27 or position 61 on CD70 both increased the dissociation rate and therefore weakened the affinity of the CD27-CD70 interaction by about twofold (Tables 2 and 3 and Table S1).

Alanine substitutions of either position 83 on CD27 or position 61 on CD70 both increased the dissociation rate and therefore weakened the affinity of the CD27-CD70 interaction by about twofold (Tables 2 and 3 and Table S1). Nearby, the hydroxyl group of residue S70 in CD27 forms a hydrogen bond with main chain oxygen of residue A80 in CD70 (Fig. 4C). The mutations A80L and A80V in CD70 showed altered and decreased binding to CD27 that cannot be quantitated by SPR, while A80R and A80F substitutions in CD70 showed ∼1.3 and ∼5-fold decreased binding affinity, respectively (Table 2). Our explanation for this behavior is that beta- or gamma-branched side chains at position 80 in CD70 will clash with CD27, but the elongated side chain of arginine can protrude from this close contact and does not deform the mainchain conformation and thus not impede the binding interaction.\n\nThe importance of another network of electrostatic interactions was also tested by mutagenesis. The acidic residue D114 of CD27 interacts with R144 of CD70, and both are stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds from neighboring amino acids (Fig. 4D). Substitutions at either CD27 position 114 or CD70 position 144 disrupted binding kinetics, including conservative substitutions such as residue D114E of CD27 (Table 3). This suggests that the exact geometry of interaction is required at this site for measurable binding to occur. Mutagenesis of the surrounding CD27 residues N88, R113, T118, and D121 also disrupted binding (Table 3), as did mutagenesis of their interacting CD70 residues S178 and N180 (Fig. 4D, Table 2 and Table S1). CD70 mutant S146D disrupted binding but S146A did not, suggesting that longer side chains sterically impede binding. H148 substitutions increased the complex dissociation rate to varying degrees. Residue K115 in CD27 is proximal to this site, but the lysine side chain contact with CD70 is marginal, so alanine substitution at position 115 did not decrease the affinity (Fig. 4D and Table 3).\n\nBoth trimeric CD70 and sc-CD70-hIgG1 require further clustering to stimulate signaling\n\nTo gain greater understanding into the requirements of CD27 signaling, we used a T cell activation assay and observed that plate-bound trimeric wild-type CD70 induced IFNγ production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). The plate-bound trimeric CD70-induced IFNγ secretion was dependent on TCR stimulation as plate-bound CD70 had no effect in the absence of anti-CD3 antibodies. The dependence of CD70-induced activation on anti-CD3 antibody concentration and the lack of stimulation from treatment with anti-CD3 antibody alone demonstrate the synergistic relationship between TCR engagement and costimulation by CD70. Similar results were obtained in a Jurkat reporter assay measuring AP-1 transcriptional activity. AP-1 induction drives cytokine production by T cells, and as much as fourfold induction of the luciferase reporter was observed with plate-bound trimeric wild-type CD70 (Fig. 5C). However, no AP-1 activation was observed for cells treated with soluble trimeric CD70 (Fig. 5C).\n\nThese results suggest that trimeric CD70 sensitized T cell activation but required artificial clustering in a plate-bound form, leading us to utilize a sc-CD70-hIgG1 biologic, which has greater potential to cluster CD27. In the sc-CD70-hIgG1 construct used here, three concatenated CD70 sequences were fused to the N-terminus of hIgG1 Fc (Fig. 5B and Fig. S1C). The sc-CD70-hIgG1 construct largely improved the yield of purification from Expi293 cell cultures compared with the trimeric CD70 ligand (50 mg/l versus 5 mg/l). Sc-CD70-hIgG1 also significantly improved the homogeneity of the protein with most of the single chain CD70-hIgG1 existing as a symmetric peak in SEC (Fig. 5B).\n\nWe then compared the functional activity of plate-bound trimeric wild-type CD70 and sc-CD70-hIgG1 in a Jurkat reporter assay. Plate-bound sc-CD70-hIgG1 exhibited concentration-dependent induction of the luciferase reporter similar to plate-bound trimeric CD70 (Fig. 5C). However, soluble sc-CD70-hIgG1 clustering was still not strong enough to induce luciferase reporter in the Jurkat reporter assay (Fig. 5C).\n\nTaken together, our data indicate that the trimeric or hexameric clustering by trimeric CD70 or sc-CD70-hIgG1 alone is not strong enough to trigger CD27-mediated signaling. CD70 requires higher-order assembly to stimulate CD27 activation (Fig. 5D). These results also align with the previous report showing that hexameric CD70 was not sufficient, and higher-order oligomerization of CD27 was necessary, for signaling activation.",

Thus, we analyzed the cytokine formation of human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) in response to 13 genetically distinct strains of the MTBC (Table 1). hMDMs were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3:1 with several strains of the clade I group (H37Rv, 4 Beijing and 3 Haarlem strains) and clade II strains (3 EAI, 2 West African 2 [WA2] strains) for 24 h, and the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 12p40 (IL-12p40), IL-1β, RANTES, and IL-6 into the cell culture supernatants was measured by cytometric bead array analysis. In order to take donor-specific response levels into account, data were normalized to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced responses of the donors. The macrophage responses to distinct isolates were substantially different (Fig. 1): macrophages from all donors analyzed showed only a very weak response to infection with Beijing isolates (4 strains), which is in line with previously published observations. In contrast, the infection with Haarlem isolates (3 strains) led to a substantial cytokine response for all 5 mediators analyzed. The response level was increased 5- to 10-fold over the amounts induced by Beijing isolates. Analysis of the culture supernatants after infection with EAI strains showed a very weak response, which resembled the levels observed with Beijing isolates. Analyses of two M. africanum isolates had more ambiguous results: while the WA-2 strain 10514/01 induced a strong release, the response to strain 10517/01 of the same lineage was rather weak. In conclusion, Beijing, Haarlem, and EAI isolates induced a distinct biological response profile: infection with Haarlem isolates led to a strong proinflammatory cytokine response, whereas the response to Beijing and the EAI strains was rather low.\n\nUptake of MTBC strains by human macrophages.\n\nTo characterize the interaction of the macrophage with the clinical isolates more closely, we studied the uptake of the strains in human macrophages: 2 × 105 hMDMs were infected with nine different strains of the MTBC: in addition to the reference strain H37Rv, we analyzed two Beijing (1934/03 and 49/02), two Haarlem (4130/02 and 2336/02), two EAI (1797/03 and 947/01), and two WA2 (10514/01 and 10517/01) strains. Cells were infected with an MOI of 0.5 to 1 bacterium per macrophage (Fig. 2) and washed 4 h postinfection (p.i.). The numbers of CFU were determined by serial dilutions of cellular lysates.\n\nThe cells ingested between 2% and 15% of the inoculated bacteria in seven of the nine strains investigated (H37Rv, Beijing, EAI, and WA2). The uptake rates of these seven isolates were not significantly different. Of note, the uptake rates of the M. tuberculosis Haarlem strains 2336/02 and 4130/02 were significantly different from those of the strains of the other lineages: macrophages phagocytosed 34.08% ± 13.8% and 53.56% ± 13.33% (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]) of the inoculated bacteria, respectively.\n\nDifferential growth of MTBC clade I and clade II strains in human macrophages.\n\nParallel cultures of MTBC strain-infected macrophages (see above) were cultured for 7  additional days and lysed, and the numbers of CFU were subsequently determined (Fig. 3A): H37Rv and the Beijing and Haarlem isolates showed a substantial growth in hMDMs. Compared to the amount of intracellular bacteria 4 h after infection, 13.3-fold (H37Rv), 11.8- and 16.5-fold (Beijing 49/02 and 1934/03), and 9.0- and 9.4-fold (Haarlem 2336/02 and 4130/02) increases in CFU were observed. In contrast, the fold increase ratios for macrophage cultures infected with clade II strains were consistently low (0.8 and 3.8 for EAI [1797/03 and 947/01] and 0.7 and 3.7 for WA2 10514/01 and 10517/01). These data suggest that there are significant differences in the growth potentials of MTBC clinical isolates in human macrophages (Fig. 3B). They demonstrate that MTBC clade I strains (Beijing, Haarlem, and the H37Rv reference strain) have a better growth capacity in human macrophages than clade II strains.\n\nIn order to analyze whether the growth of these strains would be similar in their natural habitat, we infected human bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell cultures at a ratio of 3:1 and monitored uptake and intracellular growth of the bacteria. In cells from two independent donors, the clinical isolates Haarlem 2336/02 and Beijing 49/02 multiplied considerably faster in BAL cell cultures than the EAI 1797/03 and WA2 10514/01 strains (Fig. 4).

These data demonstrate that clade I strains grow better in human alveolar lung cells than clade II strains.\n\nComparable growth of clustered and nonclustered M. tuberculosis Haarlem strains from Hamburg, Germany.\n\nStrains isolated from TB patients in Hamburg, Germany, belong predominantly to the M. tuberculosis Haarlem genotype. Some of these strains have previously been shown to cause major tuberculosis outbreaks, whereas other Haarlem strains are detected only sporadically. In order to analyze whether clinically successful (clustered) Haarlem strains show an enhanced growth in hMDMs, infection experiments were performed with three clustered strains (7761/01, 8921/02, and 7679/03) and three nonclustered strains (2336/02, 9532/03, and 4130/02). All six strains showed a profound growth in cells from three different donors, again demonstrating that clade I strains have a strong capacity to multiply in macrophages derived from healthy European blood donors (Fig. 5). A comparative analysis between clustered and nonclustered isolates showed a slightly superior growth of outbreak isolates; however, this did not reach statistical significance.\n\nAerosol infection of mice: strains of the EAI and Beijing genotypes differ in CFU development and survival rates.\n\nWe extended our study to mouse aerosol infection experiments in order to monitor whether the differential growth characteristics observed in human macrophages would also be seen in the experimental tuberculosis infection in vivo. We infected C57BL/6 (genetically resistant) and DBA/2 (genetically susceptible) mice with H37Rv and two clinical isolates: Beijing 49/02 (clade I) and EAI 1797/03 (clade II). The pulmonary bacterial burden after infection with the Beijing isolate was comparable to that for H37Rv (clade I), which was used as reference strain (Fig. 6A). Increasing bacterial numbers to approximately 107 CFU up to day 21 postinfection were seen for both genotypes, followed by a plateau as shown previously. In contrast, the bacterial burden after EAI isolate infection was approximately 100-fold lower than the level of Beijing isolate CFU. Lungs of mice infected with the Beijing isolates also showed higher numbers of cellular infiltrates and larger granulomatous lesions at days 21 and 90 than were seen with EAI strain infection (Fig. 7). These data demonstrate that the EAI strain was less virulent than the Beijing isolate although the mice were infected with twice as many bacteria. To independently investigate the virulences of the different isolates, we also monitored the survival time of susceptible DBA/2 mice after aerosol infection with the strains described above. The median survival time of mice infected with the Beijing genotype was 122 days (Fig. 6B). In contrast, 60% of the mice infected with the EAI strains were still alive on day 450 postinfection. Mice infected with H37Rv succumbed at day 120 or day 200 depending on the infection dose. Mice infected with EAI 1797/03 showed a better survival than mice infected with Beijing 49/02 and also H37Rv. These data have been confirmed in independent experiments with one additional EAI strain and Beijing strain (EAI 4850/03 and Beijing 1934/03) (data not shown). This demonstrates reduced virulence of the clade II EAI strains compared to that of H37Rv and the Beijing isolates, which belong to MTBC clade I.",

    "content": "Results\n\nPro-inflammatory cytokines impact the β-cell chromatin landscape.\n\nTo characterize the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the β-cell regulatory landscape, we first mapped all accessible or open chromatin sites in human pancreatic islets exposed or not to IFN-γ and IL-1β. We assayed chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq and, in order to focus on the β-cell fraction and to decrease inter-individual variability, in parallel with human pancreatic islet assays, we performed ATAC-seq in the clonal human β-cell line EndoC-βH1, exposed or not to the pro-inflammatory cytokines (overall number of peaks identified in human islets: 92,610-229,588; and in EndoC-βH1 cells: 52,735-110,715. Extended Data Fig. 1a). Such experiments unmasked an important remodeling of the β-cell chromatin resulting in ~12,500 high confident chromatin sites that gain accessibility (FDR adjusted P<0.05; log 2 FC>1) (Extended Data Fig. 1b) upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, the changes observed in the human β cell line were concordant with those observed in the human islet preparations (Extended Data Fig. 1c).\n\nWe reasoned that changes in chromatin accessibility may reflect the activation of non-coding cis-regulatory elements. We thus used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map cytokine-induced changes of H3K27ac (Extended Data Fig. 1a), a key histone modification associated with active cis-regulatory elements that was shown to be dynamically regulated in response to acute stimulation. We observed genome-wide deposition of the active histone modification mark upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines in both EndoC-βH1 and human pancreatic islets (Extended Data Fig. 1b-c).\n\nIntegrative analysis of ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq indicates that changes in chromatin accessibility are strongly correlated with deposition of H3K27ac (P<2×10−16, r2=0.63) allowing the identification of ~3,800 open chromatin regions that gained H3K27ac (FDR adjusted P<0.05; ∣log2 FC∣>1) upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1d). We found that this subset of open chromatin regions is preferentially located distally to gene transcription start sites (TSS) (Extended Data Fig. 1e), their sequence is evolutionary conserved (Extended Data Fig. 1f) and enriched for specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites (Extended Data Fig. 1g). We named these newly mapped regions IREs for “Induced Regulatory Elements” (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2).\n\nChromatin changes link to variation in transcription and translation.\n\nWe next explored whether the newly identified IREs were associated with changes in gene expression and protein translation. To identify β cell transcripts and proteins induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokines we assayed gene expression by RNA-seq (five replicates in EndoC-βH1 and five replicates in human pancreatic islets, Extended Data Fig. 1a) and collected multiplex proteomics data for three EndoC-βH1 replicates after exposure or not to pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nIn line with the chromatin assays, that indicated extensive gene regulatory activation, we unraveled cytokine-induced transcriptional activation resulting in ~1,200 upregulated genes (FDR adjusted P<0.05; log 2 FC>1) (Extended Data Fig. 2a-b). By multiplex proteomics, after rigorous filtering, a subset of 10,166 proteins was confidently quantified and retained for significance testing. A total of 348 proteins displayed significant changes in abundance (FDR/Q-value <0.15 and ∣FC∣>1.5; ∣log2 FC∣>0.58) being 2.19% of the overall detected proteins upregulated (Extended Data Fig. 2c), 76% of which had induced mRNA levels at 48h, confirming consistency between RNA-seq and protein changes (r2=0.72, P<2×10−16) (Fig. 1c). Protein-protein interactions inferred from β-cell cytokine-induced proteins resulted in a network more connected than expected by chance (P<10−3), significantly enriched for Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB; http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/) pathways including IFN-γ signaling, antigen processing and presentation, apoptosis and T1D (KEGG T1D P=7.9×10−8, Extended Data Fig. 2d).\n\nIn line with our expectations we found that IREs were linked to up-regulation of the nearby gene/s as well as to an induced abundance of the corresponding protein (Fig. 1d-e and Extended Data Fig. 2e). Moreover, gene induction was highly correlated with the number of associated IREs, suggesting a cumulative effect of IREs on cytokine-induced changes in gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 2f).\n\nTaken together these findings reveal that pancreatic β-cell response to pro-inflammatory cytokines is dynamic, involving extensive chromatin remodeling and profound changes in the regulatory landscape (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Such changes are associated with induction of transcription and protein translation including pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of T1D.

Such changes are associated with induction of transcription and protein translation including pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of T1D. Newly defined regulatory maps can be visualized online along with other islet regulatory annotations at www.isletregulome.org.\n\nPrimed and neo regulatory elements mediate cytokine response.\n\nWe next sought to gain insight into the dynamic activation of IREs. The relationship between chromatin openness and H3K27ac deposition upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines allows the distinction of two classes of IREs (Fig. 1b and Fig. 2a-c): “opening IREs” (n=2,436) which gain both chromatin accessibility (log2 FC>1) and H3K27ac (log2 FC>1); and “primed IREs” (n=1,362) which are already accessible chromatin sites prior to the treatment (ATAC-seq log2 FC<1) and gain H3K27ac (log2 FC>1) upon exposure to the stimulus. Primed and opening IREs are both associated to gene expression induction (Extended Data Fig. 3a), phylogenetically conserved (Extended Data Fig. 3b) and preferentially mapped distally relatively to gene TSS (Extended Data Fig. 3c). We further unmasked that 70% of opening IREs (n=1,716) are newly activated (i.e. undetectable in basal condition, see methods). We named the latter “neo IREs”. Neo IREs represent 45% of all IREs and may mirror “latent enhancers“ that were identified upon stimulation of mouse macrophages.\n\nBecause chromatin openness, the feature discerning the two classes of IREs, is believed to reflect TF occupancy, we analyzed their sequence composition in search of recognition sequences of key TFs orchestrating the β cell response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Even though IREs are mostly distal to TSS (Extended Data Fig. 3c), in order to reduce sequence biases, we excluded from this analysis all annotated promoters. The two classes of distal IREs predominantly mapped to enhancer chromatin state (Extended Data Fig. 3d) and showed clear differences in sequence composition. Newly induced enhancers were enriched for binding motifs of inflammatory-response TFs including Interferon-Sensitive Response Element (ISRE), STAT and NF-kB (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Primed enhancers instead were enriched for binding motifs of inflammatory-response TFs (ISRE, STAT), and unexpectedly, islet-specific TFs (HNF1A/B, NEUROD1, PDX1, MAFB, NKX6.1) (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Importantly, we found that, in primed enhancers, inflammatory-response and islet-specific TFs binding motifs mapped to the same genomic region, suggesting co-binding and possibly cooperation of the two classes of TFs (Extended Data Fig. 3g-h).\n\nSequence composition bias per se does not imply TF occupancy. We thus took advantage of published ChIP-seq datasets of islet-specific TFs (MAFB, PDX1, FOXA2, NKX6.1 and NKX2.2) mapped in un-stimulated human pancreatic islets to measure TF occupancy in primed and neo enhancers prior to the pro-inflammatory stimulus. As expected from the sequence composition analysis, primed enhancers (unlike neo enhancers) are highly bound by tissue-specific TFs even before their activation (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3i). TF occupancy can also be indirectly assessed by ATAC-seq, which assays the protection of the bound sequence to transposase cleavage (footprint). Footprint analysis is effective for TFs with a long residence time such as IRFs and STAT TF families. Our analyses revealed the emergence of footprint marks upon pro-inflammatory treatment in correspondence to ISRE motifs in both primed and neo enhancers (Fig. 2e) indicating cytokine-induced TF occupancy of IREs.\n\nGene regulation is orchestrated by different epigenetics mechanisms. DNA methylation is a relatively stable epigenetic mark contributing to maintenance of cellular identity. Moreover, high-resolution DNA methylation maps, obtained from multiple tissues, established that the vast majority of tissue-specific differentially methylated regions are located at distal, mostly non-coding, regulatory sites. Consequently, characterization of the DNA methylome in the context of relevant stimuli is important for understanding the functional mechanisms of tissue-specific responses in human disease. We thus explored if cytokine-induced chromatin remodeling is associated with changes in DNA methylation. We quantified DNA methylation changes by performing dense methylation arrays in EndoC-βH1 exposed or not to IFN-γ and IL-1β. The Infinium MehtylationEPIC array was designed to interrogate with high precision and coverage >850,000 CpG sites (approximately 3% of all sites in the genome) selected primarily because of their location close to gene promoters and CpG-island regions. By focusing on the 1,230 IRE enhancers harboring one or more CpG sites interrogated by the array, we observed that primed enhancers overlap lowly methylated CpGs (median β-value 0.12±0.08), that did not vary significantly upon cytokine exposure. Such observation is in sharp contrast with neo enhancers that were highly methylated under control condition (median β-value 0.77±0.10) but",

Such observation is in sharp contrast with neo enhancers that were highly methylated under control condition (median β-value 0.77±0.10) but underwent a significant loss of DNA methylation (Two-sided Wilcoxon test, P=4.13×10−4) upon the treatment (Fig. 2f). While we did not observe cytokine-induced methylation, we found that ~70% of the significantly demethylated probes (FDR adjusted P≤0.05; βcyt–βctrl<−0.20) mapping to IRE were located at neo enhancers (Extended Data Fig. 3j,k)\n\nThese results suggest that neo enhancers are enriched for methylated CpGs that undergo preferential demethylation upon cytokine treatment whereas primed enhancers are enriched for unmethylated CpGs that do not change their methylation status upon the cytokine exposure.\n\nTaken together these analyses lead to a model, in which pro-inflammatory cytokines elicit a regulatory response in β cells characterized by: 1) new induction of distal regulatory elements coupled with reduction of DNA methylation and binding of inflammatory response TFs and 2) activation of regulatory elements pre-bound by islet-specific TFs and induced by inflammatory response TFs (Fig. 2g).\n\nCollectively, these results allow reconstructing cis-regulatory networks activated in human pancreatic β cells upon exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-1β (Extended Data Fig. 4a-c and Supplementary Table 1).\n\nChanges in the islet 3D chromatin structure.\n\nRegulatory regions can exert control over genes at megabase distances through the formation of DNA loops. These loops are often confined within structures known as topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are largely conserved upon evolution, are invariant in different cell types and have their boundaries defined by the regulatory scope of tissue-specific enhancers. Our knowledge regarding the general characteristics and mechanisms of loops is improving, but much less is known regarding mechanisms and functional significance of dynamic looping events during biological processes.\n\nWe took advantage of promoter capture Hi-C (pcHi-C) performed in human pancreatic islets to explore long-range interactions between gene promoters and cytokine-induced and invariant distant regulatory elements. Interestingly, we observed that the interaction confidence scores captured between IRE enhancers and gene promoters in untreated islets were significantly reduced compared with SREs enhancers (P=1.8×10−11) (Extended Data Fig. 5a). As this finding points to potential dynamic properties of the interaction maps, we next sought to investigate if cytokine-induced regulatory changes are linked to modification of the 3D chromatin structure and if induction of β-cell cytokine-responsive regulatory elements is coupled with the formation of novel DNA looping interactions.\n\nHi-C profiles are limited in sequencing coverage and library complexity, resulting in maps of reduced resolution relative to regulatory maps of functional elements. On the other hand, 4C approaches are difficult to interpret quantitatively mainly due to potential amplification biases. We thus applied targeted chromosome capture with unique molecular identifiers (UMI-4C), a recently developed method, to quantitatively measure interaction intensities in human islets before and after exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines. We centered the conformation capture viewpoint to the promoter of 13 genes (TNFSF10, GBP1, CIITA, among others) whose expression was strongly induced by the cytokine exposure.\n\nUMI-4C showed marked changes in the 3D chromatin structure at the analyzed loci. Promoters of the induced genes gained chromatin interactions with distal genomic regions reflecting the formation of new DNA looping events (Fig. 3a-b and Extended Data Fig. 5b-d). Importantly, such new contacts were preferentially engaged with newly mapped human islet cytokine-responsive IREs (Fig. 3c).\n\nThese results demonstrate that cytokine exposure induces changes in human islet 3D chromatin conformation including the formation of novel enhancer-promoter interactions. Such changes allow the newly activated distal IREs to contact their target gene promoters.\n\nIslet cytokine enhancers are implicated in T1D genetic susceptibility.\n\nGWAS have identified ~60 chromosome regions associated with T1D with many of the association signals having been assigned to candidate genes with immunological functions. Consistent with this notion, several studies reported a primary enrichment of T1D risk variants in T and B cell regulatory elements. Furthermore, there is a substantial lack of statistical significant overlap of T1D associated variants in islet enhancers, while such regulatory elements are instead enriched for GWAS signals for T2D and fasting glucose. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms linking T1D association signals to cellular functions remain poorly described for most of the regions of association identified.\n\nWe hypothesized that a subset of T1D genetic signals may reflect an altered capacity of the β cells to react to an inflammatory environment. We thus sought to explore to what extent genetic signals underlying T1D susceptibility act through pancreatic islet regulatory response to pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nCausal cis variants are expected to lie in sequences that act as regulatory regions in state-specific and disease-relevant tissues. We thus examined non shared loci with genome-wide significant association to T2D and T1D in European populations and considered all variants in high LD (1000 Genomes Project phase3 EUR R2>0.8) with a lead SNP reported in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog.

In line with previous observations, we found that T2D but not T1D risk variants overlap human islet non cytokine-responsive regulatory elements (i.e. SREs) more than expected by chance (T2D SNPs in SREs P<2×10−16, Z=5.47). In contrast, we uncovered that human islet IREs are enriched for T1D but not T2D risk variants (T1D SNPs in IREs P=3×10−6, Z=4.61) (Fig. 4a). This result was reproduced when using regulatory elements detected in EndoC-βH1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Such findings unmasked 9 T1D associated regions (13% of the total) containing at least one islet cytokine-induced regulatory element directly overlapping a T1D associated variant (Supplementary Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6b-f).\n\nWe noticed that the two T1D lead SNPs at 1q24.3 and 16q13.13 loci (rs78037977 and rs193778 respectively) were directly overlapping IREs in islets. We used GWAS genotyping data from a cohort of 14,575 individuals (5,909 T1D cases and 8,721 controls, see methods) to confirm their association with T1D. Both variants were included in the 99% credible set of their respective locus and displayed strong association P-values (rs78037977 P=6.94e−10; rs193778 P=1.33e−7; see Supplementary Table 4 for posterior probability of association and variant ranking in the credible set), indicating that they could potentially be causal.\n\nAt the 1q24.3 locus, rs78037977 (NC_000001.10:g.172715702A>G) overlaps an islet cytokine-induced chromatin site (Fig. 4b) which is pre-bound by islet-specific TFs and is a predicted enhancer in other cell types (Extended Data Fig. 6g). We created allele-specific luciferase reporter constructs and measured enhancer activity in the EndoC-βH1 line before and after cytokine exposure. The sequence exerts enhancer activity exclusively after cytokine exposure which is disrupted by the rs78037977, T1D associated, G allele (One-way ANOVA, F=26, P=4.34×10−5) (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6h) consistent with a causal role of the variant at this locus. In order to identify the gene target of this T1D-susceptible enhancer, we reconstructed the 3D chromatin structure by chromatin capture experiments. UMI-4C in human islets identified a cytokine-induced interaction of the enhancer with TNFSF18 a gene activated in islets upon cytokine exposure (Fig. 4d-e). TNFSF18 encodes for a cytokine, ligand of the TNFRSF18/GITR receptor, known to modulate inflammatory reaction and regulation of autoimmune responses. Interestingly, we noticed that cytokine exposure results in upregulation of TNFSF18 in human islets but not in the EndoC-βH1 β-cell line, suggesting differences in gene regulatory dynamics in primary tissue or the activation of an islet cell sub-population.\n\nAt the 16q13.13 locus, rs193778 (NC_000016.9:g.11351211A>G) maps to a phylogenetically conserved, cytokine-responsive regulatory element (Fig. 4f). This sequence displays enhancer activity in both treated and untreated β cells. However, exclusively in cytokine-exposed β cells, the T1D-associated G allele exerts significantly higher enhancer activity than the protective variant (One-way ANOVA, F=12.34, P=1.23×10−3) (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 6i). The locus includes several up-regulated genes (SOCS1, DEXI, CIITA, RMI2), that could represent potential targets of this IRE. Recent works point to DEXI as a T1D candidate gene in immune cells and β cells. By performing UMI-4C experiments in human islets we observed a strong chromatin contact between the promoter of DEXI and the regulatory element bearing the rs193778 T1D-associated variant (Fig. 4h). Such data points to DEXI as a potential causal gene in pancreatic islets.\n\nAltogether these results illustrate how unraveling cytokine-induced chromatin dynamics in human islets can guide the identification of cis-regulatory variants that are strong candidates in driving T1D-association signals.",

Among the three individual discovery GWAS of IgM anti-PC, one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs74420772 in 3p14.1 achieved genome-wide significance in TwinGene (P = 2.7 × 10−8), whereas no genome-wide significant SNPs were observed in the other two studies (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). In the discovery phase meta-analysis of these three GWAS results (total n = 3002), two SNPs in 1p31.3 and six SNPs in 11q24.1 achieved genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 × 10™8, Fig. 1A; Supplementary Material, Table S1), with negligible inflation of the signal from population stratification or other sources, lambda (λ) = 1.001 (Fig. 1B). Validation of the eight associated SNPs from the discovery GWAS meta-analysis was sought in the fourth cohort (n = 646). The two SNPs in 1p31.3 were not significant (P ≥ 0.164), but all of the six SNPs in 11q24.1 were successfully replicated (P < 6.5×10−3, Supplementary Material, Table S2). On the basis of all four studies, the allelic effect size (β) of the leading SNP rs35923643-G in 11q24.1 was 0.19 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13–0.24, P =4.3 × 10−11] rank order normalized standard deviation (SD) of IgM anti-PC per allele (Table 2; Supplementary Material, Table S3). These six SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) within a 131 kb block that overlaps with the GRAM domain containing 1B (GRAMD1B) gene (Fig. 1C). The mean levels of IgM anti-PC in the genotype groups of rs35923643 (and its proxy SNP rs735665) are presented in Supplementary Material, Table S4.\n\nPolygenic risk score analysis\n\nThe allele rs35923643-G (or its proxy SNP rs735665-A, r 2 = 1, D′ = 1) has also been recognized as the top risk allele for CLL, as judged by the latest meta-analysis of six GWASs of CLL. In the latest GWAS of general immunoglobulin levels, rs735665-A was also found to be a main genetic variant specific for general IgM, rather than general IgA and general IgG. The shared genetic variants were investigated in polygenic risk score (PRS) and correlation analyses by using the summary GWAS results of IgM anti-PC (from our discovery meta-analysis), IgM [SNPs with association P < 1×10−6 from Jonsson et al. ] and CLL [from the InterLymph consortium ].\n\nPRSs on the basis of general IgM increasing alleles were positively associated with IgM anti-PC, with β close to 0.5 and P < 5 × 10−6 across all tested P-value threshold quantiles (Fig. 2A). Eight of the nine genome-wide significant SNPs for general IgM were identified in our IgM anti-PC GWAS, in which rs2476601 (P = 0.007) and rs735665 (P = 3.1 × 10−8) achieved nominal significance (Fig. 2B).\n\nPRSs on the basis of IgM anti-PC increasing alleles were associated with higher risk of CLL. Across the 5000 quantiles including genome-wide SNPs with gradually increasing association P-value with IgM anti-PC, the quantile only including the SNP rs735665 was best-fitted and explained the largest variance of CLL (Nagelkerke r 2 = 0.006, P = 1.2×1015, Fig. 2C). All of the 33 independent genome-wide significant SNPs for CLL were identified in our IgM anti-PC GWAS, in which rs9392504 (P = 0.04) and rs735665 (P = 3.1 × 10−8) achieved nominal significance (Fig. 2D).\n\nPRSs on the basis of increasing alleles for general IgM (across quantiles with gradually increasing threshold for association P-value, from P < 5.0 × 10−10 to P < 1.0 × 10−6) were associated with lower risk of CLL (Supplementary Material, Table S5). There were 43 independent SNPs (association P-values with general IgM was lower than 5.0 × 10−8) in the best-fitted quantile, explaining 0.003 of the variance of CLL risk with an odds ratio of 0.69 (95% CI 0.55–0.83, P = 4.2 × 10−8).\n\nFunctional prediction\n\nThe potential function of the variants in the top locus 11q24.1 shared between IgM anti-PC and CLL is not known. The LD block that rs35923643 located was scanned for regulatory marks in leukemia- or immune-cell lines (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2).

Peaks of histone mark monomethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4Me1) (in GM12878) and deoxyribonuclease I (DNaseI) hypersensitivity (in GM12878, CD34+ and GM12865) were found at the position of rs35923643 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3A and B).\n\nIn the chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), there were suggested binding sites for 22 different transcription factors (TFs) within the ~700bp region around rs35923643 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3C). Among the matched sequences from Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO) tool, the strongest signals were observed for Runt-related TF 3 (RUNX3) and SPI1 (Supplementary Material, Table S6). The RUNX3 binding motifs include the SNP rs35923643 (at the position of 391 bp), in which Haib_RUNX3_GM12878_Motif1_ fw_ic0 was from a B-cell line. Switching from the major allele T/A at rs35923643 to the minor C/G allele impeded the predicted binding affinity of RUNX3, making the P-value (defined as probability of match for a random sequence with the same length) to increase 10-fold (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3D).\n\nThe RegulomeDB database also gave support for rs35923643 to affect the binding of TFs in general (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Taken together, the results indicate that rs35923643 may be a more likely candidate to be the functional variant rather than rs735665 that has been frequently reported for CLL.\n\nPhenotypic association between IgM anti-PC and CLL\n\nIn a small nested case–control study (7 prevalent CLL cases, 23 incident CLL cases, with 3 age- and sex-matched controls for each case), we found IgM anti-PC to be lower in prevalent CLL cases than in matched controls (P = 0.006); although it was not different between incident CLL cases and their matched controls (P = 0.227, Table 3). No association between IgM anti-PC and incident CLL risk estimated from the stratified Cox proportional hazards model (P = 0.354). Moreover, we tested whether the difference of IgM anti-PC levels between CLL cases and the matched controls was dependent on the time between sampling and diagnosis. There was a declining but not statistically significant trend (β = –0.08, P = 0.10, Fig. 3; Supplementary Material, Fig. S5).",
