["RESULTS<SEP>Description of the families, population, and daylight exposition<SEP>We defined two types of family: type A and type B. The sample included seven type\u2010A families (44 individuals, 46.8%) and eight type\u2010B families (50; 53.2%). Fifteen patients with MS (42.8%) belonged to type\u2010A families and 20 (57.14%) belonged to type\u2010B families. Seven individuals with other AIDs (53.8%) and 22 unaffected individuals (47.8%) belonged to type\u2010A families and six individuals with other AIDs (46.1%) and 24 unaffected individuals (52.1%) belonged to type\u2010B families. Of the 94 individuals studied, 35 were diagnosed with MS, 46 had no AIDs, and 13 had other AIDs than MS (hypothyroidism in seven, hyperthyroidism in one, rheumatoid arthritis in two, type 1 diabetes mellitus in one, autoimmune uveitis in one, and systemic lupus erythematosus in one). Of the 35 patients with MS, eight had an additional AID (hypothyroidism in one, type 1 diabetes mellitus in one, ulcerative colitis in one, autoimmune uveitis in one, Guillain\u2010Barr\u00e9 syndrome in one, systemic lupus erythematosus in one, and rheumatic fever in one). Figure 2 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population, including the clinical form of MS. Regarding daylight duration (Villar\u2010Quiles et al., 2016), 91 individuals (96.8%) lived in Madrid from at least 2016, one (1.06%) lived in Miami (USA), one lived in Seville, and one lived in Toledo. The cumulative daylight duration for 2016 was 4,468.4\u00a0hr in Madrid, 4,447.8\u00a0hr in Miami, 4,459.8\u00a0hr in Seville, and 4,463.3\u00a0hr in Toledo. By group, 33 patients with MS lived in Madrid, one lived in Miami, and one lived in Toledo. The mean daylight duration for the MS group was 4,467.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0hr. All family members with other AIDs lived in Madrid, with 4,468.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0\u00a0hr of daylight. Of the unaffected family members, one lived in Seville and the rest lived in Madrid, with 4,468.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0hr of daylight.<SEP>Exonic variants of genes involved in the vitamin D signaling pathway<SEP>Analysis of the genes associated with the VD signaling pathway revealed a total of 154 different variants in the 94 individuals tested. Disregarding synonymous variants gives a final total of 77 different nonsynonymous variants (Table 1). All variants found followed the Hardy\u2010Weinberg equilibrium.<SEP>Prioritization of variants<SEP>Figure 3 illustrates the filtering and prioritization process. Prioritization yielded eight exonic variants meeting the established criteria, located on the genes LRP2 (four variants), CUBN (two variants), CYP24A1 (one variant), and METTL21B (one variant).<SEP>Variants affecting levels of circulating vitamin D<SEP>In the families, we detected single variants of CYP3A4, CYP27A1, CYP24A1, and five variants of the GC gene, with no significant differences between groups. We also analyzed the genes that regulate CYP27B1 expression (METTL21B, METTL1, FGF23, and PTH) (Table 1). Seven patients with MS (20%), one with an AID other than MS (7.7%), and eight unaffected individuals (17.4%) were carriers of FGF23 variant rs7955866. Regarding family type, this variant was present in six members of type\u2010A families (13.6%) and 10 members of type\u2010B families (29%). METTL21B variant rs141172155 was found in two patients with MS (5.7%) and in no other group. We observed two additional synonymous variants of the genes METTL21B (rs923829) and PTH (rs6256). Variant rs923829 was more frequent in type\u2010A than in type\u2010B families (16 [36.4%] vs. 8 [16%]). After prioritization and filtering, we detected rs6068812 variant of CYP24A1in one patient with RRMS, one with PPMS, and one unaffected individual from a type\u2010B family. We analyzed the variants from genes potentially involved in the 12q LD block (CDK4, TSFM, AGAP2, AVIL, CYP27B1, METTL1, and METTL21B) and compared these against variant from CYP24A1 (rs6068812). All three individuals with rs6068812 also had a variant in AVIL gene (rs2172521), which was present in all members of our cohort. Therefore, no association was observed between the 12q LD block genes variants analyzed and CYP24A1 gene variant (rs6068812). None of these variants found in the families had a significant relationship to MS or MS with AID compared to unaffected family members.<SEP>Variants affecting vitamin D internalization<SEP>We observed 18 nonsynonymous variants of LRP2, none of which was associated with MS. We also detected 29 variants of CUBN. The majority of variants observed after filtering and prioritization affected VD internalization. LRP2 variant rs34564141 was observed in two patients with RRMS associated with another AID (ulcerous colitis and Guillain\u2010Barr\u00e9 syndrome), one individual with autoimmune uveitis, and one unaffected individual from a type\u2010B family. LRP2 variant rs34355135 was detected in two individuals with RRMS, one of whom also had autoimmune uveitis, from a type\u2010B family. LRP2 variant rs3213760 was identified in one patient with RRMS and one family member with hypothyroidism from a type\u2010B family. LRP2 variant rs150752263 was observed in two patients with RRMS and an unaffected individual from a type\u2010A family. Regarding the CUBN gene, variant rs1801238 was identified in two patients with RRMS and one with PPMS (from tow type\u2010B families); two of these patients (siblings) had an additional AID (hypothyroidism and systemic lupus erythematosus). Variant rs12259370 was observed in one individual with RRMS and comorbid rheumatic fever and one individual with hypothyroidism from a type\u2010B family. We also identified a family in which the variants rs3213760 (LRP2) and rs12259370 (CUBN) were present in an individual with hypothyroidism and in no patients with MS. We found two nonsynonymous variants of DAB2 (rs3733801 and rs700241), which codes for a protein involved in VD endocytosis. No differences were detected between groups (MS, other AIDs, or unaffected individuals; type\u2010A or type\u2010B families). Variant rs3733801 was observed in 13 patients with MS (37.1%), four individuals with other AIDs (30.8%), and 15 unaffected individuals (32.6%). Regarding family type, this variant was observed in 12 members of type\u2010A families (27.3%) and 20 members of type\u2010B families (40%). Variant rs700241 was detected in one unaffected individual from a type\u2010B family (Table 1). None of these variants found in the families had a significant relationship to MS or MS with AID compared to unaffected family members.<SEP> VDR and RXRA variants<SEP>We observed only one variant of VDR and one variant (rs61751479) of RXRA (Table 1). The VDR variants observed were TaqI (rs731236), in 30 patients with MS (85.7%), 11 individuals with other AIDs (84.6%), and in 35 unaffected individuals (76.1%); and FokI (rs2228570) in 30 patients with MS (85.7%), 12 individuals with other AIDs (85.7%), and in 41 unaffected individuals (89.1%). Nine patients with MS (25.7%), three patients with other AIDs (23.1%), and 12 unaffected individuals (26.1%) were homozygous for the G allele of TaqI. GG homozygosity for FokI was observed in 17 patients with MS (48.6%), five patients with other AIDs (38.5%), and 15 unaffected individuals (32.6%). Analysis of the differences between family types for these variants revealed that TaqI (rs731236) was present in 43 members of type\u2010A families (97.7%) and 33 members of type\u2010B families (66.0%). No significant differences between family types were observed for FokI (rs2228570) (41 members of type\u2010A families [93.2%] vs. 42 members of type\u2010B families [84.0%]). None of these variants found in the families had to do with unaffected family members.<SEP> PDIA3 variants<SEP>Two missense variants have been detected on the gene encoding PDIA3 in our cohort. One of them, rs139812953, is only observed in a MS case, in a case with other AID and in two unaffected cases. The second one, positioned in chr15:44038766 is only present in two nonaffections.","Results<SEP>Allele frequencies of rs6564851, rs2278986 and rs362090<SEP>rs6564851<SEP>As shown in Table 1, in the present study the rs6564851 allele frequencies (G allele: 0.824 and T allele: 0.176), located near the BCO1 gene, are consistent with those (0.833 and 0.167) in Japanese subjects in Tokyo (HapMap-JPT) in the NCBI SNP database (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/projects\/SNP\/snp_ref.cgi?rs=6564851), whereas in Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry (HapMap-CEU) they are 0.467 and 0.533, and in Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria (HapMap-YRI), they are 0.358 and 0.642, respectively.<SEP>rs2278986<SEP>Table 1 shows that the rs2278986 allele frequencies (T allele: 0.821 and C allele: 0.179), one of the intronic SNPs in the SCARB1 gene, are consistent with those (0.841 and 0.159) in HapMap-JPT in the NCBI SNP database, in which these values are 0.692 and 0.308 in European subjects in 1000 Genomes super population (EUR), and 0.759 and 0.241 in HapMap-YRI, respectively.<SEP>rs362090<SEP>Table 1 shows that the rs362090 allele frequencies (0.674 for the A allele and 0.326 for the G allele), a nonsynonymous SNP (Pro57Ser) of the ISX gene, are in the range of the frequencies (0.727 and 0.273) in HapMap-JPT in the NCBI SNP database, whereas the allele frequencies are 1.000 and 0.000 in the HapMap-CEU, and 0.559 and 0.441 in the HapMap-YRI population, respectively.<SEP>All allele polymorphism frequencies analyzed were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) in this population (p > 0.05; Table 1).<SEP>Circulating \u03b2-carotene levels in each genotype group<SEP>Because the three polymorphisms tested herein are common SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.05 or more, two groups of homozygotes carrying major alleles and the other minor-allele carriers were analyzed below for comparison (Table 2). The average concentrations of serum \u03b2-carotene in the rs6564851 GG homozygotes (the SNP of the BCO1 gene) in total, males and females were significantly higher than those in the T allele carriers (p = 0.003, 0.039 and 0.027, respectively), showing that the GG homozygotes had a 2-fold higher serum \u03b2-carotene level compared with that of T allele carriers. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the serum \u03b2-carotene concentration between the major homozygotes and the minor allele carriers in the other two SNPs, rs2278986 (the SNP of the SCARB1 gene) and rs362090 (the SNP of the ISX gene).<SEP>As shown in Table 2, there were significant differences in the average concentrations of serum \u03b2-carotene between males and females of any genotype group, except for the rs6564851 T allele carriers (p = 0.056).<SEP>Daily intake of fruit and carotenoids in each genotype group<SEP>As the rs6564851 GG homozygotes (SNP of the BCO1 gene) showed a higher circulating level of \u03b2-carotene in total, males and females than the T allele carriers, we next surveyed their daily intake of carotenoid-containing foods. Table 3 clearly shows that the daily intake of fruit, \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and \u03b2-carotene equivalent by female rs6564851 T allele carriers was significantly lower than that by female GG homozygotes. However, in males there was no significant difference in the daily intake of these foods and nutrients between the T allele carriers and GG homozygotes. Furthermore, we found no significant differences in the daily intake of energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates, sodium and other minerals, vitamin D, \u03b1-tocopherol, and all species of fatty acids, between female GG homozygotes and T allele carriers, except for the daily intake of vitamin C by female T allele carriers, which was lower than that by female GG homozygotes (p = 0.009, see S1 Table).<SEP>There was no significant difference in the daily intake of fruit and carotenoid-related nutrients between major allele homozygotes and minor allele carriers of rs2278986 (SCARB1) and rs362090 (ISX) (Table 3).<SEP>Association of the circulating \u03b2-carotene level with the daily intake of fruit and carotenoid-related nutrients in rs6564851 GG homozygotes (BCO1)<SEP>Next, we analyzed the association of the serum \u03b2-carotene concentration with environmental factors, especially the daily intake of carotenoid-related nutrients. A statistically significant association of the circulating level of \u03b2-carotene was detected with the daily intake of \u03b2-cryptoxanthin (p < 0.05) and vitamin C (p < 0.05), and a stronger association was found with the daily intake of \u03b2-cryptoxanthin (p < 0.01) in the rs6564851 GG homozygotes. However, no association of the serum \u03b2-carotene concentration with the daily intake of carotenoid-related nutrients was detected in the T allele carriers (Table 4). These significant associations may be explained by the daily intake of carotenoid-containing foods by the GG homozygotes (see S2 Table). In contrast, the association of the circulating level of \u03b2-carotene was strongly associated with the daily intake of \u03b2-cryptoxanthin in females (p < 0.01), whereas males did not show any association (Table 4).","RESULTS<SEP>25(OH)D and DBP circulating levels<SEP>Africans vs. Caucasians<SEP>Levels of 25(OH)D and DBP were significantly lower (P = 0.003 and P < 0.0001, respectively) in African than in Caucasian HDs, when considered as continuous variables (Table 1). In particular DBP was about threefold lower in African HDs (Table 1). DBP median levels were about threefold lower (P < 0.0001) also in African BCPs, with no change in 25(OH)D median levels.<SEP>A different distribution of vitamin D and DBP (P = 0.0073 and < 0.0001, respectively) was observed between African and Caucasian HDs, when considered as discrete variables with respect to the classes of vitamin D and DBP levels reported in the materials and methods section. In particular, a higher percentage of African HDs showed vitamin D levels < 20 ng\/ml (38% vs. 8%, respectively). Similarly, most African HDs (64%) had low levels of DBP, compared to Caucasian HDs (0%, P < 0.001). These differences were lost when comparing BCPs (Table 2).<SEP>The Spearman's analyses revealed a direct correlation between 25(OH)D and DBP levels when considered as continuous variables. The increase in 25(OH)D was associated with an increase in DBP levels in the overall case series (rs=0.24; P = 0.003), in the Caucasian case series (rs=0.24; P = 0.018) and in the entire healthy subgroup (rs=0.31; P = 0.002).<SEP>HDs vs BCP within each population<SEP>Unlike DBP, vitamin D median levels were significantly higher in African BCPs than in HDs (Table 1) (P = 0.013). Level distribution of circulating markers was not significantly different between cases and controls, when considered as discrete variables (Table 2). Both markers showed no statistical difference in the Caucasian population.<SEP>SNP distribution<SEP>The genotype distributions of all selected polymorphisms from HDs and BCPs in both populations were analyzed by ethnicity for the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. A1012G and Cdx2 polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium in both populations and therefore analyzed as haplotypes (three variants: Haplo1: CG, Haplo2: TG, and Haplo 3 TA) (Table 3). DBP haplotype analyses were performed only for Caucasian subjects, as the Africans reported no DBP polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium (Haplo1: CG, Haplo2: CT, Haplo 3 AT and Haplo 4, others) (Table 3). We compared the allelic distributions of polymorphisms in our case series with those reported in European Caucasian and African populations extrapolated by the 1000 Genomes database (Table 4). We compared our Caucasian case series with an Italian Tuscany population, and our Tanzanian population with an American ancestry population (ASW) and an African population (YRI). The allelic frequency of all analyzed polymorphisms were homogeneous with the 1000 Genomes dataset for the Caucasian population. We observed a statistically significant difference in the African population for Cdx2 and rs4588, although our data showed a percentage trend similar to that reported by the 1000 Genome dataset (Table 4).<SEP>VDR SNPs<SEP>Africans vs Caucasians<SEP>African HDs showed a higher frequency of TT and AA homozygosity in A1012G and Cdx2 than Caucasian HDs (P < 0.0001 for both SNPs). Moreover, Africans had a higher CC frequency than Caucasians for Fok1 polymorphism (70% vs. 46%, respectively; P = 0.00253) (Table 5). We observed the same significant trends for A1012G and Cdx2 polymorphisms in BCPs: Africans showed 100% homozygosity for both SNPs (Table 5) compared to 34.3% and 11.4% observed in Caucasians. Fok1, instead, was similarly distributed in BCPs. The A1012G\/Cdx2 haplotype was differently distributed among African and Caucasian HDs and BCPs (P < 0.0001 for both subgroups); In particular, 78% of African HDs and 100% of BCPs had haplotype TA\/TA, compared to 8% and 14% of Caucasian HDs and BCPs, respectively (Table 3).<SEP>HDs vs. BCP within each population<SEP>A1012G polymorphism was equally distributed in HDs and BCPs in both populations. African cases had a higher frequency of AA and TT homozygosity for Cdx2 and Fok1 SNPs, respectively (P = 0.02 in both cases). No significant difference was observed in the Caucasian population (Table 5). We observed no different distribution of haplotype A1012G\/Cdx2 in either population (Table 3).<SEP>DBP SNPs<SEP>Africans vs Caucasians<SEP>The rs4588 polymorphism was similarly distributed among African and Caucasian HDs and BCPs. C allele was the most frequent among all subgroups (Table 5). TT homozygotes for rs7041 were significantly more frequent in Africans HDs (84% vs. 18%, P < 0.0001). No African HD showed GG homozygosity. A similar distribution was observed in BCPs (Table 5).<SEP>HDs vs. BCP within each population<SEP>No difference was observed between cases and controls in either African or Caucasian population for rs4588 and rs7041 polymorphisms (Table 5). Haplotypes of rs7041\/rs4588 polymorphisms were analyzed only in the Caucasian case series, since the two SNPs reported no Linkage disequilibrium in the African population. The distribution of this haplotype was not significantly different in either Caucasian BCPs or HDs (Table 3).<SEP>25(OH)D and DBP levels with respect to SNPs<SEP>VDR SNPs<SEP>We observed no difference in 25(OH)D and DBP levels with respect to the allelic variant of the VDR analyzed polymorphisms in both African HDs and BCPs (Table 6).<SEP>Caucasian HDs showed no relation between VDR SNPs and the analyzed circulating markers. Patients with CT+ CC alleles for A1012G and Cdx2 polymorphism with GA+GG vs. AA had significantly higher 25(OH)D levels (P = 0.003 and P = 0.015, respectively) (Table 7).<SEP>DBP SNPs<SEP>African HDs with a G allele in the SNP rs7041 of DBP showed higher levels of DBP \u2013 not of 25(OH)D \u2013 than those with TT homozygosity. Such difference follows the same trend, reaching statistical significance in BCPs (P = 0.048) (Table 6). Both Caucasian HDs and BCPs showed about twofold higher levels of DBP with a GG+ TC allele in rs7041. All the comparisons reached statistical significance (Table 7). The presence of CC in rs4588 in HDs and BCPs was related to significantly higher serum levels of DBP (P = 0.010) in the Caucasian population (Table 7).<SEP>Association of vitamin D and DBP levels with osteoporosis risk factors<SEP>We analyzed serum protein level changes according to osteoporosis risk factors, such as menopausal status, smoking, previous fracture, familiarity, cortisone administration and BMI (Table 8 and 9). Vitamin D levels decreased in Caucasian BC patients with high BMI (P = 0.035). Caucasians HD with previous fractures showed lower DBP levels (P = 0.048).<SEP>Caucasians: BCPs vs. HDs: 25(OH)D: Pa=0.399 DBP: Pa=0.5490.","Results and discussion<SEP>Data summary<SEP>HGV&TB database harbours data for human genetic variations associated with susceptibility to different forms of TB, such as general TB, pulmonary, extra-pulmonary, pleural, miliary, spinal, cavitary, paediatric, meningeal and HIV-associated various forms of TB. The database hosts gene information on 98 genes and 307 variants. Of the total number of genes, 7 belong to the HLA class of genes, whereas 91 belong to non-HLA genes. The non-HLA genes including CCL1, CCL2, CCL5, IFNG, IFNGR1,IFNGR2,\u00a0IL10, IL12RB1, MBL2, NOS2, P2RX7, SLC11A1 (NRAMP1), SP110, TLR2, TLR4, TNF (TNFA) and VDR have a large number of variants associated with TB. In addition, information on associated variants in HLA genes HLA-A, B, C, DPB1, DQA1, DQB1 and DRB1, which have been extensively shown to be associated with TB in multiple studies, have also been indexed in the database.<SEP>Of the total number of variants, 32 variants fall in this class of genes, from over 14 studies. A total of 72 genes and 177 variants were associated with pulmonary TB, whereas the rest were associated with other forms of TB including extra-pulmonary (14 genes, 20 variants), pleural (3 genes, 3 variants), miliary (4 genes, 4 variants), spinal (1 gene, 1 variant), cavitary (1 gene, 2 variants), paediatric (4 genes, 4 variants), meningeal (6 genes, 10 variants), HIV-associated (7 genes, 8 variants) and some were unclassified (38 genes, 84 variants) (Figure 1). <SEP>In HGV&TB, all genes and variants are indexed by unique database identifiers (HGVID). The resource could be searched using a variety of identifiers including HGVID, gene name, RSID, PMID, technique, template, geographic location, phenotype and concluded pathogenicity. Associated information including the HGVS nomenclature for the variants, the dbSNP RSID, genomic location and pathogenicity status of the variant as described in the primary literature have been included for each variant. In cases where the dbSNP RSIDs were not available, the variant change and position were obtained directly from the literature and compared with the databases using Mutalyzer. Supplementary Table S1 lists all the associated gene variant RSID\u2019s of the respective genes, and Supplementary Table S2 lists the variant change and position of gene variants, along with associated literature reference where dbSNP RSID\u2019s were not available.<SEP>Haplotypes, set of variations located on the same chromosome, are considered to be better determinants for establishing phenotypic association than single nucleotide variations. Thus, in addition to SNVs, we have also compiled information of haplotypes showing significant associations. The HGV&TB database contains information on 75 haplotypes in 37 genes (Supplementary Table S2). For example, SLC22A5 haplotype-c.652+77A>G-c.1052+237T>C-c.1053-550G>C was found to confer disease susceptibility in Thai trio family study only. Other genes, such as CCL5, CTSZ, IL12RB1, IRGM, MBL2, SP110, TIRAP, TLR1 and VDR show both independent and haplotypic disease effect in various populations. In addition, gene studies in various Chinese populations revealed that variants could confer TB susceptibility, both when present individually and when present in the form of haplotype. Variants in AKT1 gene affects pulmonary TB susceptibility in Chinese Han population both individually and in the form of a haplotype c.175+18C>T (rs3730358)-c.726G>A (rs1130233). Similar pathogenesis pattern is observed in BTNL2 gene (individual variant: rs3763313, rs9268494, rs9268492; haplotype: rs9268492-rs3763313-rs9268494-rs9405098-rs3763317-rs2076530) and MARCO gene (individual variant: rs17009726, haplotype1: rs17009726-rs2278588 and haplotype2: rs17795618-rs1371562-rs6761637-rs2011839).<SEP>Analysis of genomic loci and gene position for associated variations<SEP>For each variant in all 98 genes, specific genomic location was determined from literature and public databases, such as dbSNP and Ensembl. The chromosomal map of the variants is depicted in Figure 2. Of the total number of variations, 101 mapped to the coding sequence, 78 to the intronic region, and 38 in the intergenic region, 11 mapped to the 3\u2032 untranslated regions and 11 to the 5\u2032 untranslated regions. An additional 27 variants mapped to upstream and 5 variants to downstream regions of the genes. Apart from these, 10 variations are haplotypes and a total of 11 fall in the splicing sites or within the intronic, exonic and 5\u2032-UTR of ncRNA. Fifteen variations of the total of 307 have not been assigned any genomic loci (Figure 3A; Supplementary Table S4). A total of 197 variants did not fall in close proximity to protein-coding genes (2\u2009kb from TSS). Of these, 129 mapped to potential long-non-coding RNAs. The genomic loci and gene position mapping of the variants are summarized in Figure 2. <SEP>Functional consequences of the variations as predicted by PolyPhen2 and SIFT<SEP>Apart from the reported pathogenicity of each of the variants, we performed an independent analysis of the potential functional consequences of each of the variations. We used two independent tools SIFT and PolyPhen2 for the analysis of the functional consequences of the variants in the database. Both methods have been extensively used in the past for annotation of deleterious effects of variations on protein structure and thereby the function. Of the total number of 101 variants which mapped to protein-coding genes, 27 (out of 60 predictions) and 11 (out of 46 predictions) were predicted to be deleterious by SIFT and PolyPhen2, respectively (Figure 3B). A total number of eight variants were in consensus predicted to be deleterious by both the tools (Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Figure S1).<SEP>Associations of variants with other diseases and\/or traits<SEP>Many genes reported to be associated with TB are also found to be associated with other traits and conditions (Supplementary Table S1). For example, CHIT1 genomic variation is found to be associated with atopy, allergic rhinitis, contact dermatitis, food or drug allergy and asthma. Similarly, variants in other genes, such as BTNL2, CD209-promoter, CISH, CR-1, IL12A, MBL2, TLR8 were also found to be involved in various diseases. BTNL2 polymorphism has been recently associated with inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as sarcoidosis and also associated with leprosy. Likewise, the CD209\u2014promoter polymorphism\u2014336A\/G is associated with human susceptibility to dengue and HIV-1 besides TB. A complete list of disease classes to which each gene has been associated is presented in Supplementary Table S3.<SEP>Functional interactions between associated genes<SEP>The genes harbouring associated variants were further analysed for mutual interactions using online tools available at DAVID Bioinformatics Resource v.6.. Functional annotation analysis from DAVID bioinformatics resource revealed that most of the genes formed close gene\u2013gene interactions. This was observed from interactions based on direct or physical contact or interactions deduced using text-mining, gene context and high-throughput experiments including correlations in expression. This precisely points to the close biological context in the functional organization of the genes. A close analysis of the genes also revealed their enrichment in cell signalling pathways, especially in the Toll-like receptor signalling, cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction and the JAK-STAT pathways. No functional interaction was observed between the genes reported in the catalogue of published genome wide association studies for TB. The pathways enriched have been summarized in Table 1. A highly connected network of all the genes associated with TB was generated by STRING v.9.0 with almost every gene linked to more than one other gene (Supplementary Figure S2). <SEP>We also found evidence of gene interaction from the haplotypes associated with susceptibility to TB. Few variations in genes showed association, in concurrence with the presence of other variants of a different set of genes. For example, TLR6 gene variant (rs5743810) was not independently associated with TB, while in combination with TLR1 variants (rs4833095 and rs76798247); it was found to affect susceptibility to TB in African American population. Some disease susceptible gene variations are also found in diverse human populations, both independently and in association with variants of same or other genes. TNF alpha (TNF gene) variants (-238G\/A, -308G->A, -836 A\/C) were associated with various forms of TB in diverse populations either independently or in combination with variants in TLR4 gene [rs7791836 (TNF)-rs1399431 (TLR4)]. Similarly, variations in other genes, such as CCL2 and PSMB48 were jointly associated with susceptibility to TB. It was also observed that variations in NOS2A, TLR4 and IFNGR1 were susceptible in different populations, both individually and in association with variants of same as well as different genes. But in African populations they showed strong gene\u2013gene interactions leading towards various forms of TB.<SEP>Analysis of population frequencies of variations in HGV&TB<SEP>Independent evaluation of the variations in the HGV&TB database revealed that maximum number of variants have been discovered in African population (N\u2009=\u200990) followed by Chinese (N\u2009=\u200974) and Indian (N\u2009=\u200969) (Supplementary Table S6). Most of the reports of genes and genetic variants were confined to one population or ethnic group, barring a handful of genes, such as IFNG, IFNGR1, SLC11A1 and VDR which have been shown to be associated in a number of populations, suggesting a robust association.<SEP>In addition, allele frequencies of variations in the database were independently analysed in the world populations, using data from the HapMap project (Supplementary Figure S3; Supplementary Table S7). Additional analysis was performed on the basis of integrated haplotype score (iHS), a statistical parameter to detect evidence for positive selection. iHS data corresponding to different populations and chromosome for Hapmap phase 2 was downloaded and parsed for the entire variant dataset with respect to rsIDs. A total of 20 variants showed evidence of selection (iHS\u2009<\u2009-2) in populations (CEU, YRI) (Supplementary Table S8).<SEP>Database usage and navigation<SEP>The interface of the database has been built as a user friendly GUI wherein the homepage provides a brief summary and a search box for different query options. Each query directs the users to a table reporting all the genes and associated variations with their corresponding P-value, odds ratio, geographic location, pathogenicity and reference of the study. HGVID (HGV&TB identifiers) and rsID on this page are linked to a detailed report of the respective query in context to gene, variant, study details and external links. The \u2018Gene\u2019 panel reports the name of the gene, haplotype reported (if any) and genomic location of the gene and the variant. The \u2018Variant\u2019 panel provides a description about the type of the variant, reported phenotype, P-value and odds ratio, the reported and concluded pathogenicity and HGVS values corresponding to the variant. The \u2018Details\u2019 panel reports the details of the study which quotes the respective TB susceptible variation in context to the detection template, detection technique and the origin, ethnicity and geographic locations of the population under study. External links to dbSNP, PUBMED, UCSC and Gene Card have also been provided.<SEP>Discussion and future perspective<SEP>The advent of newer technologies for analysing genetic variations, including whole-genome sequencing methods, would enable researchers to query genomic signatures and to fine-map functional variations in genes previously shown to be associated with disease susceptibility. This would also unearth more genetic loci which confer susceptibility to various forms of TB. Systematic curation of such variations and their association from literature and sources of evidence needs to be done on a continuous basis. The involvement of the community would help achieve this goal much faster and more accurately. HGV&TB provides a starting point towards involving a larger community of researchers in the field who would on one end contribute their time and expertise curating variants, and on the other end see how these genetic variations could potentially be used in diverse clinical applications. In addition to the data being up-to-date, it is also important to ensure that the data are inter-operable with platforms and systems for analysis. The raw data have been provided on the server which can be used to perform meta-analysis to identify patterns and interesting relationships in context of multiple studies. To this end we foresee co-operation and collaboration with systems which facilitate exchange of data between resources and tools like Cafe Variome, where data are shared within different laboratories having common interest or with the wider world (http:\/\/www.cafevariome.org\/). We also foresee the potential integration of the data in resources which could enable automated analysis of whole-genome sequencing data, including data from personal genomes.","RESULTS<SEP>Genotyping was performed on DNA samples derived from 120 families (276 individuals). Call rates for the 68 SNPs ranged from 95% to 99%. Based on quality control checks, 2 families (2% of families) were excluded for being inconsistent with Mendelian inheritance on more than five genotypes (7% of genotypes). Additionally, 7 subjects (3%) were excluded for failure on more than 31 genotypes (>40%), leaving a total of 118 case-parent triads (98% of the original sample). Of those, 42 were complete triads, 72 were dyads, and 4 were monads. After these quality control measures were applied, at least 97% of the samples for each variant were available for analyses; therefore the genotypes were considered of sufficiently high quality.<SEP>The distributions of key characteristics of childhood ALL cases are presented in Table 1. The majority of cases (55%) were male. Fifty percent of the population was non-Hispanic white, with the second largest group being Hispanic (39%). Age at diagnosis ranged from 0 to 14 years, with a plurality (47%) being diagnosed at less than four years of age.<SEP>Table 2 includes estimates of the relative risks (RR estimates represent the increase or decrease in risk with each additional copy of the minor allele) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between the top 20 offspring genotypes and childhood ALL, as well as the likelihood ratio test (LRT) P-values and FDR Q-values for the model comparisons for these variants. Although there were modest associations between offspring genotypes in BHMT, MTR, MTRR, and TYMS and childhood ALL, only MTR rs2275565 was significantly associated with disease risk (RR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.86; LRT P = 0.049). However, none of the genotypes, including MTR rs2275565, were significantly associated with risk after applying the FDR.<SEP>A total of 20 maternal SNPs in BHMT, MTR, and TYMS were significantly associated with disease risk (Table 3). Specifically, 12 of the 28 maternal SNPs (43%) in MTR had a Q <0.1. The less common alleles in the 12 MTR SNPs showed a 42 to 54% reduction of risk. This trend was similar for the three maternal SNPs in BHMT with Q <0.1, whereby the less common alleles were associated with a 44 to 51% reduction of risk. When analyses were repeated among non-Hispanic Whites (to evaluate the potential for population stratification bias when assessing maternal genetic effects) the direction and magnitude of the RRs for the MTR and BHMT SNPs remained the same (data not shown).<SEP>Five of the eight maternal SNPs (63%) in TYMS had a Q <0.1. For each of these SNPs, the less common allele was associated with increased risk with the RR estimates ranging from 1.64 to 7.12 (Table 3). However, when analyses were restricted to non-Hispanic Whites, the effect estimates approached the null (data not shown)."]
