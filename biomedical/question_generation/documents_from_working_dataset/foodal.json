["RESULTS<SEP>Patient characteristics<SEP>A total of 6 patients were sequentially enrolled in Part I of the study, 3 patients in each cohort (Figure 1). All patients had resected cutaneous melanoma except for one patient who had resected ocular melanoma. A total of 20 patients were enrolled in Part II of the study. Patients were randomized into two arms \u2013 Arm A (Placebo) and Arm B (Resiquimod). All patients had resected malignant melanoma (Table 1). Expression of NY-ESO-1 in the resected tumor was not required for study entry and specimens for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis were available in only 4 of 6 patients in Part I and 10 of 20 patients in Part II. Consistent with the reported frequencies, one patient in Part I and three in Part II (Arm A (Placebo) = 1, Arm B (Resiquimod) = 3) had tumors that expressed NY-ESO-1.<SEP>Safety<SEP>All 26 patients enrolled on study were evaluable for safety. The vaccine combinations were generally well-tolerated. Dose escalation in Part I of the study proceeded as planned with no reported dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). 6 of 6 patients completed all four vaccine injections and gel applications. The dose of Resiquimod used in Cohort 2 (3 \u00d7 weekly) was chosen for Part II of the study, which proceeded as planned. 19 of the 20 patients completed all four vaccine injections and gel applications. One patient from Part II was removed from the study prior to receiving the fourth and final vaccine injection and gel application due to injection site necrosis (CTAE Grade 3) possibly related to the study drugs. There were no grade 4 or 5 adverse events. The most commonly reported adverse clinical responses were influenza-like symptoms (chills, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue) and injection site reactions (rash\/erythema, granuloma, skin induration) (Table 2).<SEP>NY-ESO-1-Specific Humoral Responses<SEP>Antibody responses to NY-ESO-1 were induced in all patients who were seronegative prior to vaccination regardless of the presence or dose of Resiquimod (Figure 2A). The majority of patients seroconverted after receiving the second or third vaccine. Antibody titers were not significantly different between patients in Arm A and Arm B at screening, C2D8, and follow up visits (Figure 2B). Pre-treatment antibody responses to NY-ESO-1 were detected in 3 of 20 (15%) patients; and all 3 patients (Arm-A = 1, Arm-B =2) demonstrated substantial increases in antibody titers after vaccination. Only one (Arm B) of 4 patients whose tumors were NY-ESO-1+ had pre-treatment anti-NY-ESO-1 antibodies. This patient had the highest anti-NY-ESO-1 titers after vaccination compared to that of all study patients (Table 3).<SEP>Mapping of epitopes recognized by vaccine-induced NY-ESO-1 antibodies was performed by ELISA using 3 overlapping long peptides covering the NY-ESO-1 protein (Peptide 1: 1-68; Peptide 2: 57-124, and Peptide 3: 113-180). As shown in Figure 2C, specific antibody responses induced by the vaccine were detected in all three regions covered by the long peptides in both Arm A and B. Consistent with previous studies, most of these antibody responses mapped to peptides 1 and 2 corresponding to the N-terminal end and central regions of NY-ESO-1.<SEP>NY-ESO-1-Specific Cellular Responses<SEP>Figure 3A shows representative flow cytometry results after IVS. NY-ESO-1-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were induced in 6 of 8 (75%) patients in Arm A and 10 of 12 (83%) patients in Arm B (Figure 3B). Pre-treatment NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 4 of 8 (50%) patients in Arm A and 2 out of 12 (17%) patients in Arm B; vaccination increased the frequencies of these CD4+ T-cell responses in all patients. In responders, NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD4+ T cells were detectable after the second and third cycle of vaccination. NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in 3 of 12 (25%) patients in Arm B (Figure 3C). Of note, 2 of the patients with NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD8+ T-cell responses also had tumors with documented NY-ESO-1 expression (Table 3). The majority of NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were polyfunctional as they secreted both IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 with a small proportion also secreting IL2. Results of the mixed model analyses showed that there was no significant difference between study arms for mean changes from baseline to post-treatment evaluations for NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses.<SEP>Mapping of reactivity to vaccine-induced T-cell responses using individual peptides showed induction of NY-ESO-1\u2014specific T-cell responses to several peptide epitopes (Figure 3D). Vaccine-induced CD4+ T-cell responses mapped mostly to the central and C-terminal regions of NY-ESO-1 protein, consistent with results from previous studies. CD4+ T-cell responses to peptides 81-100, 101-120, and 119-143 were detected in several patients (Arm A: 4 of 8 and Arm B: 10 of 12). Although not feasible in all cases due to limited cell quantities, NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD8+ T-cell responses were mapped to the central and C-terminal region of the protein. More specifically, CD8+ T-cell responses were mapped to peptides 81-100 and 161-180, which is consistent with results from previous studies.<SEP>Effect of CD25 Depletion on NY-ESO-1\u2014Specific Cellular Responses<SEP>Although designed to induce antigen-specific T-cell responses with effector function, vaccines have also been reported to induce Tregs. We also considered that circulating Tregs might compromise the induction of antigen-specific T-cell responses as a result of vaccination. To assess these possibilities, we depleted CD25+ cells from bulk PBMCs prior to positive selection of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and IVS. CD8+ T-cell responses were unmasked in an additional 2 patients (1 of 8 patients in Arm A and 1 of 9 patients in Arm B). CD4+ T-cell responses were unmasked in an additional 4 patients (2 of 2 patients in Arm A and 2 of 2 patients in Arm B). Figure 4A shows a representative example of NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD4+ T-cell responses in a patient before and after CD25 depletion. The effect of CD25 depletion was not consistent in all patients as some patients had no effect or only slightly amplified responses after CD25 depletion. Interestingly, we also detected NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD4+ T-cell responses in pre-vaccine samples in 3 of 4 patients in Arm B whose responses became detectable after CD25 depletion.<SEP>Although CD25 depletion resulted in the ability to detect T-cell responses in a subset of patients, CD25 expression in CD4+ T cells was similarly elevated pre- and post-treatment in patients with detectable NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD4+ T-cell response as compared to patients with no detectable NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD4+ T-cell response (Figure 4B). Examination of the CD25-expressing cells revealed that CD25 was co-expressed with CTLA-4 but not with PD-1, TIM-3, and FoxP3 in CD4+ T cells possibly indicative of the specific presence of inhibitory or \u201cexhausted\u201d cells (Figure 4C).<SEP>Role of TLR Polymorphisms in Response to Vaccination<SEP>Accumulating evidence suggests an important role for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within TLR genes as determinants of disease susceptibility and severity. Furthermore, SNPs may influence response and outcome to vaccination with TLR ligands. We investigated the role of TLR7 and TLR8 SNPs in the ability of a patient to respond to the vaccine regimen. Two SNPs in TLR7 (rs179008 and rs864058) and 6 SNPs in TLR 8 (rs3764880, rs2159377, rs5744080, rs2407992, rs3747414, and rs2109135) were detected. Of these 8 SNPs, TLR8 SNP rs3764880 and TLR7 SNP rs179008 were non-synonymous.<SEP>The non-synonymous TLR8 SNP rs3764880 was detected in 7 of the 20 (35%) patients in Arm A and B (Table 3). This SNP has been shown to affect the coding region of TLR8, leading to differential activation of NF-\u03baB; in addition, it was found to be associated with protection against tuberculosis and increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus. In our study, no association was observed between vaccine-induced immune responses and the presence of SNP rs3764880. The TLR7 SNP rs179008 has been associated with accelerated HIV-1 disease progression and decreased risk for Hodgkin's disease. SNP rs179008 was detected in the 3 patients in Arm B who had detectable NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD8+ T-cell responses and in 1 patient in Arm A who did not have a detectable NY-ESO-1\u2014specific CD8+ T-cell response (Table 3). When adjusted for cohort, the estimated frequency of a CD8+ T-cell response for patients carrying SNP rs179008 were almost 20 times that of patients who did not have this SNP (OR: 19.7, 95% CI 1.11 to 999, p=0.04).<SEP>Clinical Outcome<SEP>The last clinical follow-up for this study was performed in January 2014. In study Part I, 1 patient has died, 1 patient is alive with disease, 1 patient has undergone further resection and has remained without evidence of disease, and 3 patients have remained without evidence of disease. In Part II of the study, 1 patient was lost to follow-up (Arm A), 5 patients have died (Arm-A = 2, Arm-B = 3), 1 patient is alive with disease (Arm A), 6 patients have undergone further resection and have remained without evidence of disease (Arm-A = 1, Arm-B = 5), and 7 patients have remained without evidence of disease (Arm-A = 3, Arm-B = 4) (Table 3). Analysis of time to progression at the end of the study and at the last follow-up did not reveal any significant differences between study arms.","Results<SEP>Patient cohorts<SEP>The clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table I. Clinical manifestations in the discovery cohort included angioedema (35%), bronchospasm (24%), and urticaria (34%), while hypotension was reported in only 4% of cases. The length of reaction in patients with immediate hypersensitivity was 2 to 11 days, while it ranged from 21 to 26 days for patients with delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Patients were included if they had positive diagnostic assessment, as highlighted in Table I. Penicillins accounted for 75% of cases, with the most common culprit drug being amoxicillin accounting for 58% of cases in the discovery cohort.<SEP>Association with immediate reactions to BLs<SEP>We first conducted a genome-wide association study on 662 patients of European descent with immediate hypersensitivity reactions and 9217 previously genotyped population controls matched for ethnicity. The total number of SNPs, which were included in the analyses after quality control, was 4,265,742. The cases clustered within 3 major groups (Italian, Spanish, and Northern European) (see Fig E1 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) in keeping with the self-reported ethnicity.<SEP>A genome-wide significant association was identified within the Class II HLA region, rs71542416 being the top hit (odds ratio [OR], 5.17; 95% CI, 3.40-5.17; P\u00a0= 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214) (Table II, Fig 1, A, and see Fig E2 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). The frequency of rs71542416 in our control population was comparable with that reported in publicly available sources (Table II). HLA allele imputation using HLA genotype imputation with attribute bagging, or HIBAG, showed the HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 (OR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.99-4.36; P\u00a0= 6.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128) and HLA-DQA1\u221701:05 (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.92-4.45; P\u00a0= 5.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127) alleles to be significantly associated with the immediate reactions, with consistent ORs (Table II) and were tagged by rs71542416 (r2\u00a0= 0.76). Haplotype analysis identified that HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 was a risk factor even without the HLA-DQA1\u221701:05 allele (see Table E2 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 was seen in 3% of cases and <1% of controls. The frequency of the HLA alleles within the Italian penicillin-tolerant controls was 10 times less than in the Italian general population (0.1% vs 1%).<SEP>The HLA allele effect size was similar across the 3 major clusters (heterogeneity test, P\u00a0= .11) (Table III). The positive predictions in cases were fully validated by direct HLA typing. An additional 67 cases with low-quality predictions in both the loci were also typed. Among them, we found only 1 positive carrier for HLA-DRB1\u221710:01. All cases were also genotyped for rs71542416\u2014this showed a concordance of 99% between typed and imputed genotypes of rs71542416. HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 co-occurred with rs71542416 in 89% of the HLA-DRB1\u221710:01\u2013positive patients, while 12% of all cases carried rs71542416 alone.<SEP>Including rs71542416 or the HLA alleles as covariates revealed a residual protective effect of the HLA-DRA locus, tagged by rs114632839, an intronic gene variant, in accordance with the findings of Gueant et\u00a0al (Table II and see Figs E3 and E4, A in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Interestingly Genotype-Tissue Expression Program, or GTEx (Common Fund, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md), analysis revealed that this variant was a strong expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) for HLA-DRB5 (P\u00a0= 5.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221223) and splicing QTL for the HLA-DRB1 (P\u00a0= 1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221216), HLA-DRB5 (P\u00a0= 1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221216) and HLA-DRB6 (P\u00a0= 1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221216) loci with the minor alleles showing a lower intron excision ratio. Both effects were detected in whole blood and shared across other tissues (Fig E4, B).<SEP>A replication cohort of 98 patients with anaphylaxis induced by either amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table I) was recruited separately from Spain. We identified 7 individuals who were positive for HLA-DRB1\u221710:01, as confirmed by HLA typing. Comparison using the 11 Spanish HLA-typed cohorts reported at allelefrequency.net provided a total of 3137 Spanish subjects (see Fig E5 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) as ethnically matched population controls. This analysis replicated the association with an OR of 2.80 (95% CI, 1.17-6.71; Fisher exact test, P\u00a0= .016) (Fig 1, B).<SEP>Meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts showed that HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 increased the risk of immediate hypersensitivity at a genome-wide level (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.99-4.37; P\u00a0= 4.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129) (Fig 1, B). The sensitivity and specificity of the allele is 0.06 and 0.98, respectively, while the positive and negative predictive values are 17% and 94%, respectively.<SEP>The most significantly associated amino acid with immediate hypersensitivity reactions was glutamate at position 10 (OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.81-4.08; P\u00a0= 1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126) (see Table E3 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and phenoxymethylpenicillin showed the highest effect size (see Table E4 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Glutamate-10 co-occurred with other amino acids (arginine-30, valine-31, alanine-38, tyrosine-40, proline-231, glutamine-166) that had the same frequency in cases and controls as glutamate-10 and HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 (Table E3). However, association with these amino acids disappeared after condition for either glutamate-10 or HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 (Table E3). Interestingly, glutamate-10 co-occurred with the shared epitope RRA at positions 70, 71 and 74, previously associated with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and specific for the HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 allele. The ERRA haplotype increased risk (OR, 2.72; P\u00a0= 1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126) equivalent to that seen with glutamate-10 alone. None of the other risk\/protective amino acid motifs for seropositive rheumatoid arthritis spanning positions 70 to 74 in the DRB1 locus (such as QRRAA risk motif or DERAA and DRRAA protective motifs) were associated with our phenotype.<SEP>HLA analysis in patients with delayed hypersensitivity reactions<SEP>To determine whether the association with HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 was limited to patients with immediate hypersensitivity reactions, we analyzed 268 patients with delayed hypersensitivity to a variety of BLs (Table I) using the same control set (Fig E1, B). No association was identified for HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 (n\u00a0= 249; OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.55-3.26; P\u00a0= .5).<SEP>Drug-specific associations with immediate hypersensitivity<SEP>HLA-DRB1\u221710:01 was associated with penicillins as a class (OR, 3.07), but not with cephalosporins (Table IV). Among the penicillins, the strongest signals were for amoxicillin (OR, 3.48), amoxicillin clavulanic acid (OR, 2.85), and phenoxymethylpenicillin (OR, 6.66) (Table IV). When we combined amoxicillin and amoxicillin clavulanic acid cases (assuming that amoxicillin rather than clavulanic acid was the culprit), the OR\u00a0was 3.1 (95% CI, 2.01-4.85; P\u00a0= 4.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127). Additional drug-specific HLA allele associations that we identified will need confirmation (see Tables E5 and E6 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).<SEP>In the drug-specific analysis, a genome-wide signal (rs71437970) on chromosome 13 upstream of SLC15A1 (see Fig E6 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) was identified for the amoxicillin cases (OR, 2.94; P\u00a0=\u00a03.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129) (Table E6). This association was shared across the European subpopulations and with amoxicillin-clavulanate cases (see Tables E7 and E8 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). However, we failed to replicate the association, with an allele frequency that was lower than that observed in Spanish controls (0.007 vs 0.04).","Results<SEP>The patient was diagnosed as Muckle-Wells syndrome<SEP>The results of laboratory tests indicated an elevation of CRP (233.24 mg\/L) and ESR (67 mm\/h) when the patient had fever. The serum IL-1\u03b2 was increased to 24.37 pg\/ml, and serum IgE was higher than 2500.00 U\/ml. Other blood test results were normal. Bone marrow aspiration smear was normal. The X-ray examination showed no abnormality in his knees. The patient had no hearing loss and the intelligence was normal. There was no family history of similar conditions. The skin biopsy showed slightly hyperkeratosis and slightly acanthosis of the epidermis, and infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue [Figure 2].<SEP>According to the clinical manifestations of a history of periodic fever overlapping with the rashes, accompanying symptoms such as arthralgia in knees and occasional conjunctivitis, as well as the clinical examination of an elevation of CRP, ESR, and serum IL-1\u03b2, this patient was diagnosed as MWS.<SEP>Mutation in NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain- containing protein 3 gene<SEP>A heterozygous point mutation of A92T (chromosome 1: 247582188) in exon 1 of NLRP3 gene was identified in the patient with MWS [Figure 3a]. The mutation caused a nonsynonymous amino acid change of D31V, which is an amino acid site in PYD of NLRP3, a component of NLRP3 inflammasome. No mutation of NLRP3 gene was found in the patient's parents, and this mutation of A92T was not found in the 50 healthy individuals either.<SEP>D31 of pyrin domain is a nonconserved residue<SEP>The predicated and the secondary structure of D31V PYD based on the crystal structure of NLPR3 PYD (Protein Data Bank ID code: 3QF2), and the comparison among the amino acid sequence of PYD of wild type NLRP3, mutant NLRP3, and other PYD-containing proteins including NLPR1, ASC, and POP1 are shown in Figure 3b. PYD of wild type NLRP3, NLPR1, ASC, and POP1 has similar structures and amino sequences. There are six \u03b1 helixes in the PYD of these proteins. All helices have conserved residues, and conserved sites of \u03b11 to \u03b16 helix are shown in yellow and red. The residue D31 of NLRP3 PYD on the edge of \u03b12 helix is not a conserved residue.<SEP>The p.D31V mutation could increase binding between NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein<SEP>In the ASC PYD [Figure 4a], residue E13, D48, and D51 form a strong negatively charged surface, while in the NLPR3 PYD, residue K23 and R43 form a positively charged surface. These two opposing charged surfaces mediate the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC. The interaction between the negatively charged surface of ASC PYD with the positively charged surface of NLPR3 PYD could be largely enhanced by the D31V mutation [Figure 4b]. The results of SPR assay also showed that ASC PYD could bind to NLRP3 PYD D31V and the affinity is increased in a dose-dependent manner. However, the ASC PYD had much higher affinity for the D31V mutant than for the wild-type NLRP3 PYD [Figure 4c].<SEP>The p.D31V mutation may also impair NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 pyrin domain dimeric interaction<SEP>In the crystal structure of NLRP3 PYD homodimer, residue E30 and D31 were on the same protein, and these two residues could interact with residue R43 on another protein. The six salt bridges between two NLRP3 proteins form a strong interaction network in this narrow interface. However, in the established structure of p.D31V mutant PYD, unlike D31, residue V31 could not help form a strong linking. Hence, this interaction network was totally abolished. Since no interaction could be formed between R43 and V31, the formation of NLRP3 homodimer has been largely compromised by this p.D31V mutation [Figure 5a].","RESULTS<SEP>The Cytotoxic Effects of NMUr Vary with Individual Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines.<SEP>NMUr cytotoxicity was determined in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 61 different individuals (CEU, 16 male and 15 female; YRI, 15 male and 15 female). The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of NMUr (0\u2013200 \u03bcM) for 1 h, and cell viability was assessed with CellTiter Glo 48 h later (Table S2). There were significant interindividual differences in response to the cytotoxic effects of the methylating agent with IC50 values ranged from 3.6 to 103 \u03bcM overall (Figure 1 and Table S3). The IC50 values ranged from 3.6\u201395 \u03bcM in the CEU cell lines and from 36\u2013103 \u03bcM in the YRI cell lines. There was a small difference in the average IC50 value between the two populations with the YRI population slightly less sensitive to the toxic effects of NMUr: CEU, 54 \u00b1 25 versus YRI, 67 \u00b1 17 (p value = 0.03) (Table 1). This difference remained significant after adjusting for cellular turnover rate (Table 1). IC20 values were not significantly different between the two ethnic groups (Table 1).<SEP>The Mutagenic Activity of NMUr Varies with Individual Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines.<SEP>The mutagenic activity of NMUr in the lymphoblastoid cell lines was determined using an in vitro mutagenesis assay, which screens for mutations in the PIG-A gene following exposure to NMUr (Figure 2). A similar approach has been reported in TK6 cells. We chose this assay over the more common hprt mutagenesis assay since mismatch repair variants impact the response to both 6-thioguanine and methylating agents. In addition, the hprt mutagenesis assay is very labor intensive. Because the PIG-A gene codes for a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of GPI anchor proteins, mutations in this gene results in the loss of GPI-anchored cell surface antigens. A flow cytometry assay has been developed to detect these mutations, and it has been used to determine human somatic mutation rates. Therefore, this mutagenesis assay is higher throughput than the traditional hprt mutagenesis assay. To overcome the challenge of detecting very rare GPI\u2212 cells in the presence of >1 \u00d7 106 GPI+ cells, antibodies to three independent GPI-anchored proteins CD48, CD55, and CD59 were used. These antibodies were stained with R-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated primary antibodies. All live lymphocytes were selected by their ability to exclude SytoxBlue fluorescence. Further selection of live cells was achieved with APC-conjugated antibodies specific for CD19, a non-GPI-linked protein. This reduced the background noise in the quadrant containing the GPI\u2212 cells. The gating strategy is shown in Figure S1. Preliminary studies demonstrated that the PIG-A mutant frequency stabilized 2 weeks following chemical exposure (data not shown); this observation was similar to that reported for TK6 cells. To determine the reproducibility of the assay, it was performed in several cell lines using different aliquots of that cell line (Figure 3). The number of mutants induced was not associated with the cytotoxic effects of NMUr in that particular cell line at the concentration tested (Figure 3).<SEP>The assay was then performed concurrently with the cytotoxicity assay, employing 61 lymphoblastoid cell lines (CEU, 16 male and 15 female; YRI, 15 male and 15 female). The mutation frequency in the PIG-A gene was determined 2 weeks following a 1 h treatment with 0, 10, or 20 \u03bcM NMUr. These concentrations were selected to ensure that the impact of toxicity did not interfere with our ability to detect mutations; the average survival at 10 \u03bcM NMUr was 88 \u00b1 20% in the CEU cell lines and 96 \u00b1 6% in YRI cell lines (Table 1). Because of the wide range in background mutations (median: 36 mutants per 106 cells where the range was 1.9\u2013650 mutants per 106 cells), we compared cell lines based on the increase in mutations caused by 10 or 20 \u03bcM NMUr (Figure 4 and Table S4). Overall, a variety of genotoxic dose response profiles were observed. Roughly half of the cell lines were insensitive to the NMUr concentrations tested. The number of mutants per 106 cells declined with NMUr exposure in four of the nonresponsive cell lines; two of these cell lines were very sensitive to the toxic effects of NMUr (IC50 < 5 \u03bcM), whereas two cell lines were not (IC50 > 45 \u03bcM). The remaining cell lines exhibited either concentration-dependent increase in PIG-A mutants or were more mutagenic either at 10 \u03bcM NMUr or 20 \u03bcM NMUr. While there was no significant difference in the increase of mutation frequency caused by 10 or 20 \u03bcM NMUr between the two populations (Table 1), there were more CEU cell lines that responded to the mutagenic effects of NMUr than YRI cell lines (Figure 4).<SEP>The Repair of O6-mG Varies with Lymphoblastoid Cell Line.<SEP>The levels of DNA damage and repair were measured in cell lines treated with 10 \u03bcM NMUr. The average survival of the cell lines at this concentration was 88 \u00b1 20% in the CEU cell lines and 96 \u00b1 6% in YRI cell lines; this concentration was selected as it was expected that repair would not be saturated under these treatment conditions. Levels of 7-mG and O6-mG were determined by an established LC-MS\/ MS assay; active repair of 7-mG in these cell lines was minimal in comparison to O6-mG. Some loss of 7-mG could occur from spontaneous depurination. Preliminary studies demonstrated that the ratio of 7-mG\/O6-mG plateaued 6 h after a 1 h treatment with 10 \u03bcM NMUr (Figure 5), so we chose to measure DNA adduct levels at 0 and 6 h after the 1 h treatment with NMUr for the DNA repair studies.<SEP>Treatments for DNA adduct levels were performed concurrently with the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity levels. The levels of 7-mG and O6-mG levels varied significantly from cell line to cell line (Table S5), but some trends became apparent when separating the two ethnic groups. The CEU cell lines had higher levels of 7-mG at both time points as compared with the YRI cell lines (Table 1). Similarly, O6-mG levels in the CEU cell lines were also higher at both time points as compared with the YRI cell lines (Table 1). However, the ratio of 7-mG to O6-mG was not significantly different between the two groups at either time point (Figure 6 and Table 1). This indicates that the CEU cell lines generated greater levels of NMUr-derived DNA methylation than the YRI cell lines, but the average rate of repair was similar between the two groups.<SEP>The Repair of O6-mG Is Correlated to NMUr Cytotoxicity in CEU but Not YRI Cell Lines.<SEP>The data sets from the two populations were initially pooled to investigate the correlation among the various experimental end points. IC20 values were correlated with the levels of O6-mG at both 0 and 6 h (\u22120.66 and \u22120.74, respectively) as well as the ratio of 7-mG\/O6-mG at 0 and 6 h (0.67 and 0.75, respectively). Correlations were also observed between the IC50 values and the levels of O6-mG at both 0 and 6 h (\u22120.53 and \u22120.63, respectively) as well as the ratio of 7-mG\/O6-mG at 0 and 6 h (0.55 and 0.63, respectively). There was also a correlation between the percent survival at 10 \u03bcM NMUr and the ratio of 7-mG\/O6-mG at 6 h (0.56). There was no correlation of any of the cytotoxicity or DNA adduct\/repair end points with mutation frequency.<SEP>When a second analysis was performed separately for each population, significant population differences were observed (Tables S6 and S7). In the CEU cell lines, the correlation between IC20 values and the levels of O6-mG at 0 and 6 h were \u22120.78 and \u22120.83, respectively (p value = 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 and 6.5 \u00d7 10\u22129, respectively); these correlations were \u22120.26 and \u22120.45, respectively (p value = 0.066 and 0.0075, respectively) in the YRI cell lines. There was also a strong correlation between IC20 values and the ratio of 7-mG\/O6-mG at 0 and 6 h in the CEU cell lines (0.71 and 0.82, respectively; p values = 7.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22128, respectively). This correlation was not as significant in the YRI cell lines (0.49 and 0.46, respectively; p values <0.01). Similarly, there were population differences in the correlations observed between IC50 and O6-mG levels or the ratio of 7-mG\/O6-mG at 0 and 6 h. The levels of O6-mG at 0 and 6 h were strongly correlated to NMUr IC50 values in the CEU cell lines (\u22120.75 and \u22120.85, respectively; p values <1 \u00d7 10\u22127). The correlations between the adduct ratio at 0 and 6 h and IC50 values were 0.66 and 0.77, respectively, in the CEU cell lines (p value <1 \u00d7 10\u22125). In contrast, correlations between O6-mG levels or adduct ratios at either time point were not significantly correlated to NMUr IC50 values in the YRI cell lines (Table S7).<SEP>There was no correlation of any of the cytotoxicity or DNA adduct\/repair end points with mutation frequency in either cell line.<SEP>Several Genome-Wide Associations Were Observed for the Toxicological End Points.<SEP>The publically available SNP HapMap data were used to determine if there were SNPs that were significantly associated with any of the measured end points (p value < 5 x 10\u22128). This analysis was performed separately on the two populations. For the CEU cell lines, a number of SNPs achieved genome-wide significance for a variety of end points (Table 2, Figure S2 and S3). The cytotoxicity end points IC20 and IC50 had 5 and 51 significant SNPs, respectively. Four of these SNPs were overlapping; rs11258248 and rs3781080 mapped to the MCM10 gene on chromosome 10 and rs6848554 and rs6823445 mapped to LOC107986236 on chromosome 4 (Figure 7). MCM10 (Minichromosome Maintenance 10 Replication Initiation Factor) is an highly conserved protein involved in the initiation of genome replication. LOC107986236 is an uncharacterized noncoding RNA gene. There were 17 SNPs with the same region of chromosome 4 assigned to LINC02355 that were associated with IC50; this region had the most significant p-value and codes for a long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA.<SEP>Other genes with significant SNPs associated with the IC50 end point in the CEU cell lines include DEC1 (rs1414141), JARID2 (rs17576261), CC2DSB (rs2039617s), MGAT3 (rs6001605), LRP1B (rs1435603), CALN1 (rs9769512), HSH2D (rs12462702), CACNA2D4 (rs2429169), and PDIA5 (rs2241962). JARID2 (Jumonji And AT-Rich Interaction Domain Containing 2) plays a role in regulating histone methylation and contributes to the negative regulation of cell proliferation signaling. The function of DEC1 (Deleted in Esophageal Cancer 1) is unknown; however, it is thought to be a tumor suppressor gene. LRP1B (LDL Receptor Related Protein 1B) is a low density lipoprotein receptor with possible tumor suppressor activity; its deletion is associated with chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancers. CALN1 (Calneuron 1) is a calcium-binding protein. HSH2D (Hematopoietic SH2 Domain Containing) is a target of the signaling pathways in T-cell activation and may influence apoptosis. CACNA2D4 (Calcium Voltage-Gated Channel Auxiliary Subunit Alpha2delta 4) is part of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex and regulates the kinetics of calcium channel activation\/inactivation. PDIA5 (Protein Disulfide Isomerase Family A Member 5) facilitates protein folding and thiol-sulfide interchange reactions and participates in the unfolded protein response.<SEP>Several SNPs were associated with a couple of the NMUr derived mutagenesis end points in the CEU cell lines. Two SNPs were associated with the difference in mutations caused by 20 \u03bcM NMUr relative to untreated controls; one SNP (rs4956349) is an intronic SNP for RNF150 (Ring Finger Protein 150) and the other is in an unassigned region of DNA. The difference between mutations at 10 and 20 \u03bcM NMUr was associated with 4 SNPs in the CACNA2D3 (Calcium Voltage-Gated Channel Auxiliary Subunit Alpha2delta 3) gene on chromosome 3. Like CACNA2D4, it is part of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex and regulates the kinetics of calcium channel activation\/inactivation.<SEP>One SNP was associated with the levels of O6-mG at both 0 and 6 h after a 1 h exposure to 10 \u03bcM NMUr. This SNP is an intronic variant of LOC107986746, a gene on chromosome 7 that codes for an uncharacterized noncoding RNA.<SEP>Fewer SNPs reached the level of genome-wide significance in the YRI cell lines (Table 3 and Figures S4 and S5). The SNP rs10941686, which is an intron variant for CDH18, was significantly associated with the IC20 end point (Figure 8a); cadherin 18 is a member of the cadherin superfamily of integral membrane proteins that facilitates calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion.<SEP>There were 5 SNPs associated with the levels of O6-mG at 6 h after NMUr treatment in the YRI cell lines. One of these SNPs is in the MGMT gene, which codes for the protein that repairs O6-mG (Figure 8b). Other genes with associated SNPs are PTPRM and GALNT14 as well as uncharacterized regions of DNA on chromosomes 12 and 8. PTPRM (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Receptor Type M) plays a role in cell\u2013cell adhesion. GALNT14 (Polypeptide N-Acetylgalac-tosaminyltransferase 14) catalyzes the transfer of N-acetyl-d-galactosamine to serine or threonine residues on mucins; changes in this protein can affect response to therapy or play role in cancer progression.<SEP>We then interrogated the GWAS data to determine the association of the GWAS significant SNPs with the other outcomes (Tables S8 and S9). In the CEU cell lines, many of the SNPs that were highly associated with the IC20 or IC50 end points were also associated with p < 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 with the IC50 or IC20 end point, respectively. The direction of the association was the same (if positive, positive; if negative, negative). The highly significant SNPs for these two outcomes were also tended to be associated with the levels of O6-mG at 0 and 6 h after a 1 h exposure to 10 \u03bcM NMUr, with the more significant association with the data at 6 h (p < 1 \u00d7 10\u22125). In this case, the association is opposite: when the toxicity data is positively associated with the genetic variation, the O6-mG adduct levels are negatively associated with the same genetic variation. This result is expected because higher levels of O6-mG are associated with increased toxicity (lower IC20 or IC50 concentrations).<SEP>There was no overlap between the significant SNPs or genes identified in the GWAS analysis between the two populations. For some of the SNPS, the cause is likely genetic since all the cell lines employed in the CEU or YRI populations had the exact same genotype for the SNP (i.e., rs1762436 in the CEU LCLs and rs1251410 in the YRI LCLs). However, for the majority of the SNPs, the significant association between SNP and outcome were only observed in one of the populations. Similar observations have been reported for other toxic chemicals. Only one of the highly significant SNPs identified for the IC50 end point in the CEU cell lines (rs2039617) was associated with the same end point in YRI cells (Table S8); the p value of 0.0017 was not significant when adjusted for multiple comparisons. Similarly, only one SNP, rs10941686, significantly associated with IC50 in the YRI cell lines was also associated with IC50 levels in the CEU cell lines (Table S9); the p value of this association (0.0037) was not significant when adjusted for multiple comparisons.","Results<SEP>Subjects and Demographic Data<SEP>Of the 571 DNA samples with genotyping of the 384 SNPs in the 159 allergy candidate genes (Fig. S1) in our cohort study, 469, 491 and 409 subjects completed follow-up at 1.5, 3 and 6 years of age, respectively. The demographic data of the subjects at 1.5, 3 and 6 ages were comparable with those of the 571 subjects with cord blood (CB) samples studied in our previous report. There were no significant differences in gender, family atopy history, parental smoking history, prematurity or CBIgE elevation. The mean IgE levels (\u00b1 standard deviation) at newborn, 1.5, 3 and 6 years of age were, respectively, 0.36\u00b11.34, 120.70\u00b1212.31, 152.29\u00b1265.73 and 223.20\u00b1409.16 kU\/L. The characteristics of the infants participating in this genetic study are presented in Table 1. The demographic data among subjects studied at newborn, 1.5, 3 and 6 years of age were not significantly different (P>0.05). The intra-correlations of IgE levels among newborn, 1.5, 3 and 6 years were highly significant correlated one another (P<10\u22126; Table 2). The correlations of CBIgE levels to the total IgE levels in childhood were significantly correlated (r\u200a=\u200a0.25\u20130.27), but lower than the correlations of the IgE levels among 1.5, 3, and 6 years of age (r\u200a=\u200a0.59\u20130.75). The highly significant intra-correlations of IgE levels among different ages (newborn, 1.5, 3 and 6 years of age) suggest that allergic sensitization with IgE production occurs early in perinatal stage. Moreover, we found that total IgE levels in the Taiwanese children were higher than those in children of other cohorts.<SEP>Associations of Gene Polymorphisms with IgE Production during Childhood<SEP>Of the 384 SNPs studied, a total of 350 SNPs were included for the final analysis after excluding those with a call rate less than 90% or beyond the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). We used the Chi-square test to analyze whether certain genotypes were associated with elevation of IgE levels at ages 1.5, 3 and 6 years (higher (>75th) vs. lower (<25th) percentile), tested the gene-gene interactions by MDR analyses and validated the risk gene-gene interactions on IgE production by the rate displays of Chi-square tests.<SEP>We have previously shown that twenty-one SNPs in 14 genes are associated with CBIgE elevation (\u2267 0.5 kU\/L) (summarized as Table 3 and Fig. 1A). Here, we found that 53 SNPs in 37 genes were associated with IgE elevation in different ages (newborn, 1.5, 3 and 6 years) using univariate analysis (UVA). The IL-13, rs1800925 was the most significantly associated with CBIgE elevation, and HLA-DPA1, rs1431399 was the most significantly associated with the IgE elevation at 6 years of age. Five genes associated with CBIgE elevation persisted into childhood associated with infant IgE elevation at 3 years of age. The CD209 polymorphisms were associated with infant IgE elevation both at 3 and 6 years of age. The CYFIP2 polymorphisms were associated with IgE elevation at newborn, 3 and 6 years of age (Table 3; Fig. 1B).<SEP>While we arbitrarily clustered whether the genes associated with IgE production are related to innate immunity, adaptive immunity or stress and response genes, we found that 13 SNPs in 9 innate immunity genes conferred risk for or protected against elevated IgE levels. These innate immunity genes, namely CCR5, TNFA, IL6, CLEC2D, CLEC7A, CLEC9A, CCL17, CX3CL1 and CD209, were significantly associated with higher or lower IgE levels. These genes were mainly clustered in chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 12, 16 and 19 (Table 3). Nineteen SNPs in 14 adaptive immunity genes were associated with higher or lower IgE levels. These adaptive immunity genes were IL5RA, CD80, IL13, IL9, HAVCR1, HAVCR2, IL17A, HLA-DPA, HLA-DQA, TAP1, IL2RA, RAG2, IL4R and IFNGR2, mainly clustered in chromosomes 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 16 and 21 (Table 3). We also discovered 21 SNPs in 14 stress and response genes associated with higher or lower IgE levels at newborn, 1.5, 3 and 6 years of age. These stress and response genes, including PTPN22, PDGFRA, GC, FGF1, CYFIP2, GSR, GNAQ, C11orf74, EHF, C11orf72, GSTP1, EMR3, XRCC1, and ADAM33, were mainly clustered in chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 19 and 20 (Table 3). We formulated these genes associated with IgE production from newborn, 3, and 6 years of age in an immune response pathway scheme as shown in Fig. 1. CX3CL1, IL13, IL17A, PDGFRA, ADAM33, etc. were associated with the CBIgE elevation; CX3CL1, CYFIP2, PDGFRA, GC, and IL13 were associated with the IgE elevation at newborn and 3 years of age; HLA-DPA1, HLA-DQA1, CCR5, IL5RA, CD80, etc. were associated with the IgE production at 6 years of age.<SEP>Gene-gene Interactions on IgE Production during Childhood by MDR Analysis<SEP>Given the important role of genes related to higher or lower IgE production, we sought to study gene-gene interactions on IgE production at newborn, 1.5, 3 and 6 years of age. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis was used to investigate whether certain SNP combinations of the 350 SNPs studied were significantly associated with IgE production (Table 4). In MDR, we found significant combinations on two-way and three-way models of gene-gene interactions, but not on four-way model of IgE production at newborn, 1.5, 3, and 6 years of age (Table 4). The combination of NPSR1, rs324981 and FGF1, rs2282797 was associated with IgE production at 1.5 years of age; the combination of IL13, rs1800925, CYFIP2, rs767007 and PDE2A, rs755933 was associated with IgE production at 3 years of age; and the combination of CLEC2D, rs1560011, COLEC11, rs10210631 and CCL2, rs2857656 was associated with IgE levels at 6 years of age. The false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR) of these putative combinations were 0.385, 0.258 and 0.350 (FPR); 0.299, 0.341 and 0.225 (FNR), respectively, at 1.5, 3, and 6 years of age.<SEP>To validate the gene-gene interactions revealed by MDR analyses, we controlled for the significant SNPs of allergy candidate genes at the ages of 1.5, 3 and 6 years and for the perinatal factors including maternal atopy, paternal atopy, parental smoking, gender, and maturity in the multivariate analysis. As shown in Table S1A, the interaction of NPSR1, rs324981 and FGF1, rs2282797 was significantly associated with IgE production at 1.5 years of age (P\u200a=\u200a1.46\u00d710\u22124). The interaction among IL13, rs1800925, CYFIP2, rs767007 and PDE2A, rs755933 was significantly associated with IgE production at 3 years of age (Table S1B, P\u200a=\u200a5.98\u00d710\u22127). The interaction among CLEC2D, rs1560011, COLEC11, rs10210631 and CCL2, rs2857656 was significantly associated with IgE levels at 6 years of age (Table S1C, P\u200a=\u200a6.65\u00d710\u22127). We also validated the risk classifications by rate displays of the Chi-square test. As shown in Fig. 2A, we evaluated the two-way model of MDR on the interaction between NPSR1, rs324981 and FGF1, rs2282797 and then validated the significantly different (P<0.001) high and low risk classifications by the Chi-square test (Fig. 2B). In the nine interaction items, the combination of NPSR1, rs324981 TT with FGF1, rs2282797 CC had the highest risk (85.7%) of IgE production at 1.5 years of age, and the combination with NPSR1, rs324981 TT and FGF1, rs2282797 TC had the lowest risk (19.4%) of infant IgE production at 1.5 years of age.<SEP>In the three-way model of gene-gene interactions, the combination of IL13, rs1800925, CYFIP2, rs767007 and PDE2A, rs755933 had the highest average testing balance accuracy at 63.1%, classifying high and low risk classifications to the IgE elevation at 3 years of age (Fig. S2A). The differences between the high and low risk classifications were validated by the rate displays of the Chi-square test on IgE production at 3 years of age (Fig. S2B), showing the highest risk (100%) of IgE elevation at 3 years of age in the combination of three IL13, CYFIP2, and PDE2A genotypes. Similarly, the three-way model of gene-gene interactions on elevation of IgE levels at 6 years of age were classified into high and low risk groups by MDR (Fig. S3A), and validated by rate displays of IgE elevation on the Chi-square test. The combination of CLEC2D, rs1560011 AG, COLEC11, rs10210631 AA, and CCL2, rs2857656 GC or the combination of CLEC2D, rs1560011 GG, COLEC11, rs10210631 AA, and CCL2, rs2857656 CC had the highest risk for higher IgE production (Fig. S3B). Fig. S4 showed longitudinal analyses of the trajectory of IgE production from newborn to 6 years of age based on the best MDR models of gene-gene interactions for the IgE production at different ages. The higher risk classifications of gene-gene interactions for CBIgE elevation identified by MDR analysis were significantly associated with the higher IgE production at 1.5 and 3 years of age but not at 6 years of age (Fig. S4A). The higher risk classifications of gene-gene interactions for the higher (>75%) IgE production at 1.5 years of age identified by MDR analysis were significantly associated with the higher IgE production at all age groups (newborn, 1.5, 3 and 6 years of age; Fig. S4B). The higher risk classifications of gene-gene interactions for the higher IgE production at 3 years of age were significantly associated with the higher IgE production at 1.5 and 6 years of age (Fig. S4C). The higher risk classifications of gene-gene interactions for the higher IgE production at 6 years of age were significantly associated with the higher IgE production in all age groups (Fig. S4D). This suggests that the genetic association with CBIgE production could predict the IgE production until 3 years of age, and the genetic association with IgE production at 1.5 years of age could predict IgE production at 3 and 6 years of age."]
