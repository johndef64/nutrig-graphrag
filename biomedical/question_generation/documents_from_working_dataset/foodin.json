["Results<SEP>Single nucleotide variants in genes related to telomere biology<SEP>The possible genetic bases of the diseases were studied in patients that presented symptoms related to dyskeratosis congenita (DC), either mucocutaneous symptoms or, more often, aplastic anemia (AA) or sporadic or familial cases of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Patients with these diseases present significant telomere shortening. According to previous reports, patients with telomere length below the 1 % of the age-mated population in the case of DC and\u2009<\u200910% in AA and PF where included in this study. Beside clinical symptoms, DC\/AA and PF patients differed at the age of presentation of the disease, 12.2\u00a0+\u00a012.2\u2009years for DC\/AA and 58.3\u00a0+\u00a010.2\u2009years for PF (Additional file 1: Table S1).<SEP>First analyses were made in six patients by PCR amplification of exons of the DKC, TERT and TERC genes using the previously described High-resolution melting and DNA sequencing method (Patients indicated by an asterisk in Tables 1, 4 and Additional file 1: Table S1). Subsequently, taking advantage of newer technologies, DNA samples of 41 patients were analyzed by massive sequencing of a panel of genes related to haematological disorders including all the genes previously associated to telomere-related diseases (Additional file 1: Table S2). Out of these patients, 23 were diagnosed of DC\/AA and 18 of PF.<SEP>Nucleotide variants were further analysed when their frequency in the general population was lower than one in a thousand. The results obtained for genes previously related to telomere shortening are shown in Table 1. These studies allowed the identification of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels at TERT, TERC, RTEL1, ACD and CTC1 genes in heterozygosis. Histograms of the Sanger sequencing reaction confirming these variants are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S2.<SEP>TERT variants were found in eight patients (Table 1). AA patient 129 presented two missense variants, p.P65T and p.C931R. The p.P65T variant was inherited from the mother of the patient, which also presented short telomeres. The p.C931R variant was not present in the parents of the patient. AA patient 196 presented in heterozygosis a deletion of two nucleotides at positions c.475_476 that produced a frame shift mutation after the amino acid residue 158. One stop codon will be found 31 residues downstream, resulting in a 189 amino acids-long protein. This variant was inherited from the father of the patient, which presented PF. A son of the patient that also presented this variant, died before birth. AA patient 263 carried in heterozygosis the TERT p.V84E variant. His father also carries the variant in heterozygosis and presents PF and short telomeres. A sister that carries the variants is presently unaffected at the age of 33\u2009years (Fig.\u00a01).<SEP>PF patient F075 presented two missense variants at TERT, p.R447C and p.R742H. The variant p.R742H has been already reported while the p.R447C variant is described for the first time. The mother and a brother of this patient died of PF. PF patient F185 presented the p.S602\u2009L amino acid variant. PF patient F219 presented the p.R671W variant, reported to be pathogenic. PF patient F220 presented an in-frame deletion at amino acids 671_672 that has not been previously described. A variant in a splicing consensus site was found in patient F400.<SEP>Variants in TERC were found in three patients (Table 1). AA patient 156 presented in heterozygosis a deletion of two bases (r.96_97delCU) that has been previously described. The mother of the patient died with PF and liver cirrhosis, a brother carrying this variant also presented liver cirrhosis and short telomeres. However, a sister that carries the variant is presently healthy at the age of 40\u2009years even if her telomeres are short. PF patient F120 presented the r.269G\u2009>\u2009A variant, that has not been previously reported. PF patient F253 presented the undescribed r.23G\u2009>\u2009C variant. PF patient F219 presented the p.P722S variant in CTC1 that has not been previously described.<SEP>Four patients presented rare variants in RTEL1 in heterozygosis (Table 1). AA patient 90 presented the p.R998* variant recently reported as pathogenic. The father and one sister of the patient carried this variant, and presented short telomeres (Fig. 1). A representative Southern blot of telomeres including relatives of patient 90 is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1. In addition, patient 90 and mother carried the p.Q929del variant, recently described. AA patient 211 presented the new pS483I variant and the described p.C1244R variant. In addition, patient 211 presented the amino acid variant p.F818S in PALB2 protein, also involved in telomere maintenance, as will be discussed later. The RTEL1 variant p.C1244R was inherited from the father and the RTEL1 variant p.S483I and the PALB2 variant from the mother and both parents presented average telomere length (Fig. 1). PF patient F001 presented the p.R998* pathogenic variant. This RTEL1 variant was present in the three analyzed relatives of patient F001, all with short telomeres (Fig. 1). PF patient F020 presented the described p.F988\u2009L and the non-described p.R574C variants.<SEP>Nucleotide variants in ACD, coding for the TPP1 shelterin protein, were observed in two patients. AA patient 145 presented the p.P16Q amino acid variant and AA patient 109 the p.V94I variant, both in heterozygosis. The variant of patient 145 is inherited from the mother that reports several relatives affected of DC. Patients 109 and 145 presented chromosome 7 monosomy.<SEP>Single nucleotide variants in genes related to DNA repair and homologous recombination<SEP>Massive sequencing identified a number of rare SNVs (frequency lower than one in a thousand) in genes coding for proteins involved in DNA repair by homologous recombination, as shown in Table\u00a02. Among these genes are those coding for the protein kinases ATM (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), mutated in the genetic-instability syndromes Ataxia Telangiectasia and Seckel syndrome, respectively. Rare variants in these proteins were found in 35% of the DC\/AA and 17% of the PF patients (Table 2). Fanconi Anemia is also due to cytogenetic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and defective DNA repair. This disease can be caused by mutation in genes that code for components of a protein complex involved in DNA repair. Rare variants in several of these genes (FANCA, FANCD2, FANCF, FANCL, FANCM, FANCU) were found in 22% of the DC\/AA and PF patients (Table 2). The DNA- associated proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Breast Cancer 1 and 2) also play an important role in DNA break repair and recombination in association with PALB2 (Partner and Localizer of BRCA2). Rare variants in the BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 genes were found in 26% of the DC\/AA and 17% of the PF patients (Table 2). RecQL4 is a DNA helicase (RecQ-like, type 4) involved in DNA damage repair and rare variants were found in 17 and 11% of DC\/AA and PF patients, respectively. Variants in the gene coding for the structure-specific-endonuclease subunit SLX4, involved in DNA repair and replication, were found in 22% of the DC\/AA and 6% of the PF patients (Table 2). Mutations in SLX4 have been associated with Fanconi Anemia (group P). Finally, single rare variants were found in other genes coding for proteins involved in DNA repair such as WRN, BLM, RAD51, RAD51C and NBN in 9 and 17% of the DC\/AA and PF patients, respectively. The variants found in these genes for each patient are shown in Table\u00a03. Some of these variants are described for the first time as indicated (\u201cNot described\u201d in Table 3).<SEP>The variants present in each patient and their clinical evolution from diagnosis are summarized in Table\u00a04. Two patients with previously described DKC1 mutations, 26 and 36, are included. This table includes some variants whose frequency is slightly higher than one in a thousand (indicated in bold letters). One of them is a variant in the gene POT1 (pQ301H) present at a frequency of 0.002 in the ExAC database. The change is possibly damaging and is present in patient F106. A second variant in NHP2 (p.R101Q) is present at a frequency of 0.002 at the ExAC database. The change is possibly damaging, and has been detected in three patients (F200, F120 and 223). Among the proteins involved in DNA repair, two patients (F20, 109) present the p.T287A variant at the RAD51C gene (frequency of 0.003 in the ExAC database). Other two patients (26 and 134) present the p.A492D variant at the MRE11A gene (frequency 0.002 in ExAC).<SEP>The possible correlation between the presence of rare variants in proteins involved in DNA repair or replication, telomere length and clinical manifestation was investigated in the family of several patients (Fig.\u00a02). AA patient 134 carries one variant in the ATR gene not previously described. The variant is inherited from his mother and grandmother, both relatives have short telomeres. The father and maternal grandfather, that do not carry this variant, present an average telomere size.<SEP>AA patient 181 present a variant in RECQL4 not described previously. This variant is present in the father with very short telomeres. The mother does not carry this variant and has longer telomeres even that below the average of the population (10%).<SEP>AA patient 198 presents a novel variant in ATM and a rare variant in RAD50. The ATM variant is inherited from the mother and the RAD50 p.R850Q variant from the father (Fig. 2). The father present telomeres of average size and the mother of size bellow the average. However, the son presents relatively shorter telomeres than the parents.<SEP>The PF patient F106 carries a rare variant in BRCA1 and a relatively rare variant in POT1 (frequency 0.002). The patient has four brothers and three have been also diagnosed of PF. Two of them carry the same variants in POT1 and BRCA1 and short telomeres. A sister carries only the BRCA1 variant and very short telomeres although is presently asymptomatic. Two of the brothers carry exclusively the POT1 mutation and present longer telomeres (25\u201350% of the population) although one of them has developed pulmonary fibrosis. The patient has a daughter, which inherited the BRCA1 variant and present very short telomeres. Two nephews and a niece carry the BRCA1 variant and have short telomeres. One niece inherited the POT1 change and presents short telomeres.","3. Results<SEP>Rs1800795 genotypes are summarized in Table 1: 42% GG, 40% GC, and 18% CC. The CC genotype was not present in the 13 African American (AA) women (seven GC, six GG). The SNP was in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (\u03c72 = 3.15) in the non-AA population. IL-6 and BMI at baseline were lower in participants with the CC genotype compared to carriers of the G allele.<SEP>In the mixed model, the CC group had lower IL6 compared to the GC\/GG groups across time-points (p = 0.06, Model 1, Table 2), but this effect was attenuated with adjustment for BMI (Model 2, Table 2). Excluding AAs did not change results, so we report analyses with AAs included. The genotype*time interaction added to Model 1 was not significant, indicating that changes in marker levels were not different by genotype. Specifically, mean (95% CI) change in IL-6 levels between baseline and at 6 months for G allele carriers was \u22120.44 (\u22120.68, \u22120.20) compared to \u22120.44 (\u22120.96, +0.08) pg\/mL for the CC group, and at 12 months, \u22120.99 (\u22121.24, \u22120.74) for G carriers versus \u22120.65 (\u22121.19, \u22120.11) for the CC group. Genotype did not modify the diet effect on longitudinal IL-6 levels (genotype and diet model vs. genotype, diet, genotype*diet model, likelihood ratio test p = 0.71).","RESULTS<SEP>Exome sequencing and burden analysis in patients with CAKUT reveals likely pathogenic variants in SRGAP1<SEP>Since CAKUT are most frequently inherited in an autosomal dominant mode with incomplete penetrance, we hypothesized that different novel heterozygous mutations in the same gene in two or more unrelated individuals with CAKUT could represent monogenic causes for CAKUT. Hence, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in 98 individuals from 26 unrelated families with isolated CAKUT. The 26 families included in the present WES study all had an affected child with a diagnosis of the CAKUT spectrum and they all remained genetically unsolved after 2 previous targeted sequencing studies comprising 23 known CAKUT genes. A burden analysis of novel potentially pathogenic variants in all 26 affected families revealed 29 genes as significantly enriched with novel potentially pathogenic variants as compared to 2,000 Swedish control exomes. Since we only considered novel variants we used a large control cohort regardless of their ethnical background as previously described by one of the co-authors. We identified two affected individuals and one affected mother from two unrelated families harboring different heterozygous mutations in SRGAP1 (Table 1 and Figure 1). In family A4732 of European origin, the index patient A4732-21 and his mother were affected. A4732-21 was diagnosed prenatally with a right multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK). At 2.5 years of age there was no renal tissue detectable on renal ultrasound, indicating that the dysplastic kidney remnant had undergone complete involution (Figure 1A). Ultrasound examination of the patient\u2019s asymptomatic mother, A4732-12, demonstrated right non-obstructive duplex kidney (Figure 1B). Both, the index patient and his mother were heterozygous for the SRGAP1 mutation c.806G>A, leading to the amino acid substitution p.C269Y (Table 1 and Figure 1E\u2013G). The missense mutation p.C269Y affects an amino acid residue conserved in vertebrates and is absent from public variant databases (>17,000 control chromosomes of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project and the 1000 Genomes Project) and from 1,972 European subjects in the in-house Yale variant database. In the individual A1041-21 of Arabic\/European descent with caudally fused kidneys (horseshoe kidney) including a multicystic dysplastic right upper pole, a hypodysplastic left upper pole and extra-renal features, we detected the heterozygous SRGAP1 mutation c.1993C>A, causing an amino acid exchange in a conserved residue, p.P665T (Table 1 and Figure 1). The mutation was inherited from the father, who was clinically not affected. The father was not available for renal ultrasound examination. In order to identify additional families with SRGAP1 mutations, we screened for mutations in SRGAP1 in our previously described cohort of 845 affected individuals with CAKUT, which did not reveal additional affected families. However, since potentially pathogenic variants in SRGAP1 were significantly enriched in our CAKUT cohort and since SRGAP1 is a molecular interactor of the ROBO2 receptor, a known CAKUT-causing gene, we chose to conduct further functional studies to investigate causality of the newly identified SRGAP1 mutations.<SEP>SRGAP1 is expressed in early mouse nephrogenic mesenchyme and colocalizes with ROBO2 to the cap mesenchyme of developing rat kidneys<SEP>To examine the role of SRGAP1 during normal kidney development, we analyzed a Srgap1-lacZ reporter mouse line (Supplementary Figure 1 online). \u03b2-galactosidase staining for cells from Srgap1 promoter-driven lacZ reporter expression at E11.5 detected Srgap1 in the developing nephrogenic mesenchyme, including the mesonephros and metanephros (Supplementary Figure 1 online). We confirmed expression of Srgap1 in metanephric mesenchyme at E13.5 and E14.5 by in situ hybridization (Supplementary Figure 2 online). Srgap1-expressing cells were absent from the E11.5 mouse nephric duct and the ureteric bud, which is consistent with what is described for Robo2 during early mouse kidney development.14 This also is in line with microarray gene expression data in the Gudmap expression database (www.gudmap.org) (Supplementary Figure 3 online). To further relate SRGAP1 expression pattern to renal developmental phenotypes, we performed immunofluorescence staining of SRGAP1 in kidneys of embryonic and newborn rats (E16.5 and P0, respectively). We found Srgap1 to be expressed in rat kidney at E16.5 (Figure 2A+B) and P0 (Figure 2C+D), whereas we did not detect SRGAP1 in adult rat kidney (data not shown). During rat kidney development, we found SRGAP1 to be expressed in renal mesenchyme where it colocalizes with ROBO2 in SIX2-positive cap mesenchyme (Figure 2A\u2013D). We detected the strongest overlap of the SRGAP1 and ROBO2 signals at the ureteric bud-facing pole of the cap mesenchyme, strongly suggesting active SLIT2-ROBO2-SRGAP1 signaling at this site (Figure 2B). These data are highly consistent with the CAKUT phenotype observed in individuals with heterozygous SRGAP1 mutations. Additionally, Srgap1 is expressed in developing podocytes, suggesting an additional function here, which is in line with previous work describing podocytes as Robo2-expressing cells (Figure 2 A, C, D, and Supplementary Figure 4 online).<SEP>SRGAP1 mutations cause augmented inhibition of RAC1<SEP>SRGAP1 has been shown to act down-stream of SLIT2-ROBO2 and to reduce the GTP-bound (active) state of RAC1, which is important for lamellipodial extension and retraction cycles in cell migration. We hypothesized that the newly identified mutations in SRGAP1 in families with CAKUT may have an effect on RAC1 and CDC42 activity, which could alter cell migration of the cap mesenchyme during kidney development. Hence, we studied RAC1 and CDC42 activity using a PAK1-assay in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) transiently overexpressing wild-type SRGAP1 versus mutant SRGAP1 proteins (Figure 3). Interestingly, we found that the mutant SRGAP1 proteins p.C269Y and p.P665T shared an increased inhibition on RAC1 activity as compared to wild-type SRGAP1 indicating a gain-of-function effect of the mutations (Figure 3). CDC42 activity was unchanged (Supplementary Figure 5 online).<SEP>Novel pathogenic variants in SLIT2 cause CAKUT in humans<SEP>Next, we aimed to identify additional CAKUT-causing genes that are a component in the SLIT2-ROBO2-SRGAP1 signaling pathway. We and others have recently published that heterozygous ROBO2 mutations cause CAKUT in humans and mice. Intriguingly, mutated SLIT2 has been reported to cause a CAKUT phenotype in a knockout mouse model making it a promising candidate gene for human CAKUT. In order to identify SLIT2 mutations in patients with CAKUT we utilized high-throughput exon sequencing to screen for mutations in SLIT2 in 749 affected individuals with CAKUT. We identified three unrelated individuals with three different heterozygous SLIT2 missense mutations affecting conserved amino acid residues which were absent from public variant databases (Table 1, Figure 1H\u2013J). Individual A3748-21 with multiple subcortical cysts in both kidneys had the mutation SLIT2 c.292G>A, p.A98T (Table 1 and Figure 1H\u2013J). Individual A4736-21 with right MCDK was found to have SLIT2 c.1697G>A, p.S566N (Table 1 and Figure 1H\u2013J). Interestingly, as described in individual A4732-21 with an SRGAP1 mutation, this individual also showed MCDK and complete involution (Figure 1C\u2013D). The third individual, A3468-21, who was diagnosed with right renal agenesis at 14 years of age, had the mutation SLIT2 c.2712A>T, p.K904N (Table 1 and Figure 1H\u2013J).<SEP>SLIT2 mutations cause reduced inhibition of cell migration<SEP>Knockout mice lacking Slit2 develop supernumerary ureteric buds that remain inappropriately connected to the nephric duct, resulting in CAKUT in the form of multiple ureters and fused dysplastic kidneys. The SLIT2 protein has a well-studied function as a chemorepellent in neuronal cell migration. Given the CAKUT phenotype of the Slit2 knockout mouse model, we hypothesized that the newly identified mutations in SLIT2 would alter its chemorepulsive activity. To test this hypothesis, we studied the function of SLIT2 mutants on anterior subventricular zone (SVZa) cell migration. Neuron precursor cells from the rat olfactory bulb express ROBO2 receptors and are repelled by wild-type SLIT2. In this model, we overexpressed wild-type SLIT2 and mutants in HEK293T cells and harvested SLIT2-conditioned media 72 hours after transfection. SVZa cell migration in the presence of wild-type SLIT2 or mutant-conditioned media was analyzed after 24 hours by counting migrated cells (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 7 online). We observed the expected radial migration of cells in the conditioned media from mock-transfected HEK293T cells. SLIT2 wild-type conditioned media strongly inhibited cell migration (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 7 online). However, the SLIT2 mutations p.A98T, p.S566N, and p.K904N compromised the inhibition of SVZa cell migration, suggesting a loss-of-function effect (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 7 online).","Results<SEP>Descriptive statistics<SEP>Participant characteristics of the sub-cohort of Look AHEAD used in these analyses are shown in Table 1. Individuals were evenly distributed between the ILI and DSE intervention arms, and had comparable age, gender and ethnicity as in the entire cohort (data not shown). No baseline differences in demographic or clinical characteristics across ILI and DSE were observed. Similar to the larger Look AHEAD trial, participants assigned to ILI lost significantly more weight at year 1 and 4 than those assigned to DSE. SNP characteristics, including the obesity risk allele identified in the prior literature, are presented in Table 2.<SEP>Genetic associations with baseline weight<SEP>Genetic associations of SNP markers with baseline weight are listed in Table 3. Obesity risk alleles in FTO, SH2B1 and QPCTL\/GIPR regions predicted baseline weight in directions consistent with prior research. Risk alleles for the markers in these 3 genes were associated with elevated baseline weight of 1.01\u20131.29 kg per copy. Similar associations were found for baseline BMI (Table 3), with BMI effects per risk allele in the 0.38\u20130.46 range.<SEP>Genetic associations with weight loss at year 1<SEP>Genetic associations of the full set of SNP markers with year 1 weight change in ILI and DSE are listed in Supplemental Table 1. No SNPs were significantly associated with the magnitude of weight change in either ILI or DSE or interacted with treatment arm in predicting the degree of weight change<SEP>Weight regain<SEP>Participant characteristics for those who lost 3% or more at year 1 of their weight at baseline are presented in Table 1a. Genetic associations of the full set of SNP markers with weight at year 4 in this subgroup is presented in Table 4. The obesity risk (A) allele at FTO rs3751812 was significantly associated with weight regain in DSE (1.559 kg per risk allele, p = 0.005), but not ILI (-0.092 kg per risk allele, p = 0.761), resulting in SNP\u00d7treatment arm interaction (p = 0.009). Similar effects were seen for FTO rs1421085 and rs9922708.<SEP>A regional plot of the association of FTO with differential change in weight regain across ILI and DSE is depicted in Supplemental Figure 2. Of interest, rs3751812 and SNPs in linkage disequilibrium do not show the strongest association with differential weight change across ILI and DSE. One SNP, rs8061397, in a distinct linkage disequilibrium block is associated with differential change in weight across ILI and DSE (p = 6.4 \u00d710\u22125), suggesting a possible additional signal in the region.<SEP>In a possible replication of prior research, the obesity risk (G) allele at BDNF rs6265 was associated with greater weight regain across treatment arms (0.773 kg per risk allele), although results were of borderline statistical significance (p=0.051). When combined, the FTO and BDNF SNPs accounted for R2 = 1.43% of year 4 weight across treatment arms.","Results<SEP>Clinical signs of I-GS in Komondors<SEP>Owners of affected Komondors first noted signs of failure-to-thrive between 2.5 and 5\u2009months of age that were progressive until institution of parenteral cobalamin administration. Typical clinical signs included inappetence, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, and weakness. One dog exhibited a fine head tremor, and another had intermittent seizures. On physical examinations the puppies were lethargic and underweight but of near-normal linear size.<SEP>Routine complete blood counts revealed a non-regenerative, normocytic, normochromic anemia or low-normal hematocrit. Neutrophil counts were between 900 and 3700\/\u03bcL (normal range for puppies 5000-12,000\/\u03bcL) and some appeared toxic and\/or hypersegmented. The dogs also had a mild thrombocytopenia. Serum chemistry indicated mildly increased blood urea nitrogen, normal serum creatinine concentrations, and increased anion gaps, suggesting a metabolic acidosis. Serum bile acid concentrations were normal. Serum cobalamin concentrations were undetectable (<150\u2009ng\/L) or below the lower limited of normal (250\u2009ng\/L). Urinalysis showed mild to moderate proteinuria by dipstick (2+ to 4+ in concentrated urine). Urine metabolic screens showed strongly positive methylmalonic acid (MMA) spot test results, and quantitative organic acid analyses revealed extremely high MMA concentrations of 20,000\u201337,000\u2009mmol\/mol creatinine (normal upper limit\u2009=\u20092\u2009mmol\/mol creatinine). The mid- to low-molecular weight proteins found in urine from affected dogs were identified as cubam ligands, including transferrin, albumin, vitamin D binding-protein, haptoglobin, and apo A1 (Fig.\u00a01).<SEP>Detailed clinicopathological information was available from 5 affected dogs, 3 males and 2 females that presented over a period of 12\u2009years from both coasts of the United States and the Midwest (Additional file 1). Family history of affected Komondors, when available, indicated that parents and other littermates were clinically healthy. The 2 female affected dogs had 3 normal littermates. One of the affected females died before biochemical or molecular genetic diagnosis, but clinical signs and laboratory results indicated that it most likely suffered the same disorder as the others. The same mating subsequently produced 2 more affected males and 3 normal littermates (Fig.\u00a02). The 2 affected dogs of the second litter were ascertained at 10\u2009weeks of age, before the onset of clinical signs, by measuring serum cobalamin concentrations and urinary MMA excretion, and life-long parenteral cobalamin treatment prevented clinical abnormalities. The incidence of the disorder in this nuclear family (4 affected, 2 males and 2 females, of 10 total puppies) was as expected under the hypothesis of autosomal recessive inheritance (Fisher\u2019s exact test p\u00a0<\u20090.0003).<SEP>Cyanocobalamin (400\u20131000\u2009\u03bcg) administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly led to rapid clinical responses. One affected dog was treated with 800\u2009\u03bcg of cyanocobalamin spray administered to oral mucous membranes and responded well and rapidly. Cyanocobalamin administration continued with subcutaneous injections every other week to monthly or with sublingual spray daily, and the dogs remained clinically asymptomatic. Each affected puppy rapidly gained weight and became active, and all other clinical signs resolved, including tremors and seizures. The seizing dog\u2019s phenobarbital and potassium bromide treatments were discontinued without seizure recurrence after initiating cobalamin treatment. All laboratory abnormalities resolved except for the ligand-specific mild to moderate proteinuria, recurring low serum cobalamin concentrations, and moderately elevated serum MMA concentrations.<SEP>Molecular genetic investigations<SEP>Genetic exclusion analysis<SEP>Clinical, hematological, and biochemical signs compatible with cobalamin deficiency and mild proteinuria suggested dysfunction of cubam in both ileal brush border and renal proximal tubular epithelia, but there was also the possibility of IF dysfunction accompanied by proteinuria of unrelated cause. Cubam dysfunction is genetically heterogeneous in humans, and dogs. In dogs, the disorder is caused by certain variants of either CUBN or AMN that segregate within certain breeds. Variants causing IF dysfunction are confined to the CBLIF locus (previously designated GIF) and thus far have only been reported in human patients. To simplify interpretation of the many variants expected in an investigation by whole genome sequencing (WGS) with comparison to a single reference genome, we undertook genetic exclusion of the various candidate genes. We genotyped those members of the nuclear Komondor family segregating I-GS (Fig. 2) for which DNA samples were available, including both parents, 3 affected dogs, and 4 clinically normal littermates.<SEP>There was a fully informative SNV ~\u20096\u2009kb centromeric from the 3\u2032 end of AMN and a second informative SNV ~\u20092.1\u2009kb telomeric of the 5\u2032 end of AMN (Table\u00a01; Additional file 2). Alleles of these AMN-flanking SNVs were in linkage disequilibrium, but none of the restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) they created segregated with the disease locus (Table\u00a02; Additional file 2), thus excluding AMN as a candidate gene. The CBLIF locus was similarly excluded by examining alleles of an intron 6 pentanucleotide repeat in the same nuclear family. Neither allele segregated with the disease locus (Tables\u00a01 and 2; Additional file 2).<SEP>Because the CUBN gene is 259 Kb in length, we examined marker alleles near both ends of the gene (Table\u00a01; Additional file 2). Alleles of an SSR in CUBN intron 4 and another in intron 56 were in linkage disequilibrium. Alleles of both SSRs were homozygous in the 3 affected dogs, heterozygous in both parents and 3 normal littermates, and homozygous wild-type in 1 normal littermate (Table\u00a02; Additional file 2). These data failed to exclude CUBN from the disease locus, thus we focused our search for a disease-causing variant on that candidate gene.<SEP>Whole genome sequencing<SEP>Whole genome sequences of 3 I-GS affected, the sire of 1 of them, and a clinically normal Komondor (20\u201325 coverage each) were compared to the CanFam 3.1 canine reference genome sequence. This revealed 2 homozygous missense variants in AMN (NM_001002960.1) of the affected dogs: c.8C\u2009>\u2009G (p.Ala3Gly) and c.313C\u2009>\u2009T (p.Leu105Phe). Both variants were also homozygous in the clinically normal sire of 1 of the affected dogs, and both variants were considered tolerant by SIFT. Similarly, there were 4 variants in CBLIF (NM_001005759.1) that we considered nonpathogenic because, while homozygous in an affected dog, they were also homozygous in his clinically normal sire: c.41C\u2009>\u2009T (p.Ala14Val); c.913G\u2009>\u2009A (p.Val305Ile); and c.1074-10_1074-2delAATCTTGCA (does not change the splice acceptor site of intron 7). A variant c.244A\u2009>\u2009G (p. Ser82Gly) was heterozygous in both an affected dog and his sire. All the CBLIF missense variants were considered tolerant by SIFT. There were no disruptive or missense variants of TCN2, encoding transcobalamin, in any affected dog sequenced.<SEP>In CUBN (NM_001003148.1) we observed 2 homozygous SIFT-tolerant variants in the affected dogs that were also homozygous in the clinically normal sire and, therefore, which we did not consider pathogenic: c.6201C\u2009>\u2009A in exon 41 (g.19,950,597; p.Phe2018Leu) and c.7175\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C in exon 46 (g.19,960,139; p.Val2392Ala). The clinically normal Komondor\u2019s sequence had an additional homozygous variant c.9362G\u2009>\u2009C (g.19,999,373; p.Ser3121Thr), which was tolerant by SIFT analysis.<SEP>However, and of particular note, there was a CUBN variant (NM_001003148.1; c.8746\u2009+\u20091G\u2009>\u2009A) at genomic position chr2:g.19,981,457 (CanFam 3.1), which was homozygous (A) in the affected dogs, heterozygous (A\/G) in the clinically normal sire, and wildtype sequence (G\/G) in the normal Komondor. This variant obliterates a splice donor consensus sequence in intron 55, predicting an abnormal RNA splicing pattern, and was thereby considered pathogenic. We confirmed the variant in all 6 affected Komondors by Sanger sequencing (Fig.\u00a03a). A search of CUBN variants in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; http:\/\/gnomad.broadinstitute.org, accessed Nov. 16, 2018), including WGS of 282,822 healthy humans, revealed 38 variants in the +\u20091 position of the 66 intronic splice donor sites (frequency of 2.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20096). None were homozygous.<SEP>CUBN variant genotyping<SEP>We assessed segregation of the putative CUBN disease-allele in a family and 3 sporadic cases of Komondors with I-GS using a convenient DNA genotyping assay (Table\u00a01; Additional file 2) of PCR to produce an amplicon flanking the variant and restriction enzyme (Bce AI) digestion to discriminate the alleles (Fig. 3b). The A allele was indicated by failure of the PCR amplicon to be digested except at the control Bce AI cut site. The 6 affected dogs were homozygous A, the 3 parental dogs were heterozygous A\/G, and the 5 clinically normal littermates were homozygous G or heterozygous A\/G (Table\u00a02; Additional file 2).<SEP>We assessed Komondor I-GS allele frequencies in North America and Hungary using a TaqMan\u00ae assay. Of 98 Komondors genotyped, 12 were heterozygous, and 86 were homozygous G for the CUBN NM_001003148.1; c.8746\u2009+\u20091G\u2009>\u2009A variant. Seven of 42 Komondors from North America (allele frequency of 8.3%) and 5 of 56 Komondors from Hungary (allele frequency of 4.5%) were heterozygous (i.e. carriers of the putative disease-allele). Pedigree analyses revealed distant relatedness among some carriers in Hungary and to some Komondors in North America, including 1 of the 3 sporadic cases (Fig. 2). The nearest common ancestors (top of Fig. 2) to all affected dogs in the United States whose pedigrees were available were dogs born in Hungary in 1968 and 1973, respectively, and subsequently imported into United States breeding programs. The CUBN c.NM_001003148.1; c.8746\u2009+\u20091G\u2009>\u2009A variant was not observed in 100 dogs of other breeds."]
