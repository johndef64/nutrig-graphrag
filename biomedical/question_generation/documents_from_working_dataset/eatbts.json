["RESULTS<SEP>Global association between dietary nutrients and risk for methylation<SEP>Descriptive statistics for studied variables were summarized by ethnicity (Table 1). A significant global association (Ppermutation=0.003) was identified between dietary nutrients as represented by the four top-ranking principal components (Supplementary Figure) and methylation using the quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion (QIC) statistic. In addition, component 2 which provided an integrative summary of more consumption of vitamin A, folate, and vitamin D and less consumption of saturated fat (Supplementary Table 2) was significantly associated with reduced risk for gene methylation (per standard deviation, OR=0.72, 95% CI=0.58\u20130.89, P=0.0031).<SEP>Effect of folate intake from different dietary sources on methylation<SEP>Among seven folate measurements (Supplementary Table 3), total folate and folate equivalents including supplements and fortified food, folic acid from supplements and fortified food, and folate from supplements were significantly associated with reduced methylation. Three major sources of folate in diet including natural food folate, folate from fortified food, and folate from supplements were assessed in one model to better understand which source of folate was most influential for methylation. Interestingly, only folate from supplements was significantly associated with methylation with 400 \u03bcg folate (the difference between lower and upper quartile in the LSC) reducing methylation by 9% (95% CI=0.84\u20130.99, P=0.028). Multi-vitamins and individual vitamin supplement are the two major sources for folate from supplements. Folate from supplements remained significantly associated with methylation (per 400 \u03bcg of folate, OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.81\u20130.98, P=0.016) when multi-vitamin use was included in GEE for adjustment, suggesting that the effect for folate from supplements was unlikely to be affected by other components in the multi-vitamins. This premise is further supported by the finding that individual folate supplement was protective against acquisition of methylation (per 400 \u03bcg of folate, OR=0.74, 95% CI=0.61\u20130.88, P=0.00083, n=609) in LSC members not currently taking multi-vitamins.<SEP>Other nutrients and methylation<SEP>Further analysis was conducted using the greatest significance (P=0.021 for total folate intake) seen among seven dietary folate measurements as the threshold to guide the identification of nutrients with the strongest associations with methylation (Supplementary Table 4). Seventeen nutrient measurements were identified with six (vitamin B12, manganese, manganese without supplements, magnesium, vitamin D, and niacin) protective against methylation (Table 2). Due to the moderate to high correlations observed between some of the 18 nutrients (including folate), a stepwise approach based on the QIC statistic was employed to select a set of relatively independent nutrients for assessing their contribution to methylation (see details in Supplementary methods). Two protective nutrients (vitamin B12 and manganese) and two risk nutrients (sodium and saturated fat) were identified in the final model. A combination of higher dietary intake of vitamin B12 and manganese (from lower to upper quartile) and lower intake of sodium and saturated fat (from upper to lower quartile) reduced methylation by 36% (95% CI=0.27\u20130.45, Ppermutation<0.001).<SEP>Interaction between B12 and MTHFR variant for risk for methylation<SEP>MTHFR catalyzes the irreversible reduction of 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate (THF) to 5-methylTHF that provides the methyl group for the remethylation reaction of homocysteine to methionine which is catalyzed by methionine synthase with B12 as the cofactor. SNP rs1801133 results in an Ala to Val change at codon 222 of exon 4, the folate binding site of MTHFR. Each copy of the T allele of rs1801133 leads to about a 30% reduction of MTHFR enzyme activity in vitro. Thus, we tested whether the association between B12 or folate intake and methylation could be modified by rs1801133. Genotype data for rs1801133 was acquired from our previous studies. Excitingly, a significant interaction was identified between B12 and rs1801133 (CC versus CT and TT) for methylation (P=0.0042). Stratification analysis by genotype identified a significant association for B12 only in LSC members with CC genotype (OR=0.97, 95% CI=0.95\u20130.98, P=0.000090, n=592), but not in those with T allele (OR=1.0, 95% CI=0.99\u20131.00, P=0.36, n=776). The interaction between folate and rs1801133 was not statistically significant (P=0.61).<SEP>Dietary nutrients and ethnic disparity in methylation<SEP>Individual nutrient analysis using multivariate linear regression identified 71 nutrients that had significant difference in their average levels between Hispanics and NHWs (Supplementary Table 1, FDR<0.05). The average difference of these 71 nutrients between the two ethnic groups was about 10.6% of the values seen in NHWs. Interestingly, Hispanics had higher dietary intake for only three nutrients (i.e., wheat germ, maltose, and copper without supplement).<SEP>Mediation analysis was conducted for the 101 nutrients without missing data to ensure optimal power. Twenty-two nutrients were identified to be nominally significantly associated with ethnicity and with methylation (Supplementary Table 1 and 4). Twelve nutrients were identified to reduce the coefficient for ethnicity by 3\u201323% and the delta changes of the coefficients for ethnicity for each of the 12 nutrients were all statistically significant (Ppermutation<0.05, Table 3). The mediation effect was further supported by showing no interaction between ethnicity and each of the individual 12 nutrients for affecting methylation (Ps for interaction>0.26). Inclusion of all 12 nutrients in the model reduced the coefficient for ethnicity by 42% (Ppermutation<0.001, Table 3).<SEP>The effect of nutrients on double strand DNA repair capacity<SEP>Combinational effect of eight protective nutrients that also explained 42% of the ethnic disparity in methylation (Table 2 and 3) was assessed for the effect on double strand DNA repair capacity in 114 LSC subjects with dietary and double strand DNA repair capacity data available. Principal component 1 was extracted from the calorie adjusted dietary intake of the eight nutrients and explained 59% of the total variance. One inter-quartile range of principal component 1 was associated with a reduction of 1.43 cells with chromosomal aberration with adjustment of covariates, suggesting that these nutrients in combination were associated with a better double strand DNA repair capacity (P=0.02). However, this difference may be underestimated because of the in vitro culture period (72 hours) with standard medium for primary lymphocytes. Thus, we replicated these results using three immortalized human lung epithelial cell lines cultured in customized medium with high versus low levels of these eight nutrients. Although the low nutrient medium only slightly reduced the cell exponential proliferation rate by 22% to 30% (P=0.015, not shown), it dramatically increased the micronucleus frequency by 68 to 133% compared to high nutrient medium (Figure 1B). Overall, the data suggest that these eight protective nutrients for methylation in combination provide a better DNA repair capacity towards double strand DNA breaks, a mechanistic biomarker tightly linked to the acquisition of aberrant gene promoter methylation during lung carcinogenesis.","Results<SEP>Genome-wide association study of motion sickness<SEP>We performed a GWAS in 80 494 individuals from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc., a personal genetics company. Participants were of primarily European ancestry and were at most distantly related to each other (i.e. first cousins and closer were excluded). Motion sickness was assessed using online self-report. Participants responded to questions about their degree of car sickness on a scale of 0 (never motion sick), 1 (occasionally), 2 (sometimes) or 3 (frequently) as described in the Materials and Methods. Details about the cohort can be found in Table 1 and in the Materials and Methods. All analyses were controlled for age, sex and five principal components of genetic ancestry. Manhattan and quantile\u2013quantile plots are provided in Figure 1 and Supplementary Material, Figure S1. The genomic control inflation factor was 1.156.  <SEP>Lead SNPs with P-values under 5 \u00d7 10\u22128 for motion sickness are shown in Table 2; 35 regions were significant (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). The entire dataset is shown in Supplementary Material, Table S1. We created a genetic propensity score based on the number of risk alleles for the 35 index SNPs. Individuals in the top 5% of the distribution (allele dosage of 40.25 or more risk alleles) had an average motion-sickness score 0.546 units higher than those in the bottom 5% (28.37 or fewer risk alleles). The top 5% had 6.37 times increased odds of being \u2018frequently\u2019 motion sick as opposed to \u2018never\u2019 motion sick as compared with the bottom 5%. The variance in motion sickness explained by the propensity score (which may be inflated as it was assessed in the discovery population) was 0.029. <SEP>A few associated SNPs are in regions implicated in eye and ear development or balance. For example, our most significant association is with rs66800491 (P = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u221244), located roughly 1 Mb upstream of PVRL3, which encodes the cell adhesion protein Nectin-3. Loss of PVRL3 expression in both humans and mice results in ocular defects. The SNP rs10514168 (P = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22129) is located downstream of TSHZ1, a gene involved in inner ear development in the mouse. Another association is with rs2153535 (P = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221218), located upstream of MUTED, which is implicated in balance. Three additional associated SNPs are near genes with major roles in early development: rs2551802 (P = 2 \u00d7 10\u221212) between HOXD3 and HOXD4; rs9906289 (P = 6.4 \u00d7 10\u221211) in HOXB3; and rs149951341 (P = 3.4 \u00d7 10\u221212) near TLE4. The HOXD SNP is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 \u2248 0.9) with rs2072590, which is associated with ovarian cancer.<SEP>Several other associated SNPs are located near genes involved in neurological processes including synapse development and function: rs11713169 (P = 5.9 \u00d7 10\u221213) in NLGN1 encoding neuroligin; rs6069325 (P = 7.2 \u00d7 10\u221221) upstream of CBLN4 encoding a member of the cerebellin precursor protein family; rs62018380 (P = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22129) downstream of MCTP2, a gene involved in intercellular signal transduction and synapse function; rs7957589 in PDZRN4 (P = 7.9 \u00d7 10\u221210) near CNTN1 (contactin 1), which plays a role in axon guidance during neural development; and two independent SNPs, rs4343996 and rs34912216 (P = 8.7 \u00d7 10\u221211 and 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22128, respectively) in SDK1 encoding sidekick-1, a cell adhesion molecule that localizes to synapses. The SNP rs2150864 (P = 6.3 \u00d7 10\u221215) is located \u223c1.5 Mb upstream of LINGO2, a gene implicated in essential tremor. Additional associated SNPs in or near genes in neurological pathways include: rs9834560 (P = 9.7 \u00d7 10\u221215) in CPNE4 encoding copine-4, and two independent SNPS in or near AUTS2 (rs1195218 and rs6946969 (P = 4.5 \u00d7 10\u221222 and 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22129, respectively).<SEP>Other associated SNPs are in regions involved in glucose and insulin homeostasis. For example, the second most significant association we found is with rs56051278 (P = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221229) in GPD2 that encodes glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2, an enzyme implicated in glucose homeostasis. This SNP is in high LD (r2 \u2248 0.8) with rs2116665 (the non-synonymous substitution H264R in GPD2) that was previously associated with free fatty acid and glycerol levels. The SNP rs11129078 (P = 3.4 \u00d7 10\u221221) is located downstream of UBE2E2, which encodes a component of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system. This system is implicated in the autophagy of pancreatic \u03b2-cells that produce insulin and plays important roles in insulin homeostasis. In addition, rs705145 (P = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221221) is located just upstream of GPR26, encoding a G protein-coupled receptor. Mice with a deletion of the GPR26 gene develop hyperphagia and diet-induced obesity, which leads to metabolic complications linked to obesity including glucose intolerance, hyperinsulemia and dyslipidemia. The SNP rs4076764 (P = 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22129) is located upstream of RGS5, a regulator of G protein signaling. Loss of RGS5 in the mouse is also associated with hyperphagia. Finally, rs7170668 (P = 1 \u00d7 10\u221210) is located upstream of NR2F2 encoding COUP-TFII (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II), a protein with roles in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. The remaining associated SNPs are in regions implicated in hypoxia (rs1858111 near RWDD3, P = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u221214); iron homeostasis (rs10970305 near ACO1, P = 1 \u00d7 10\u221227); brown adipose tissue (rs61759167 in PRDM16, P = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221213); and other less characterized processes: rs2360806 (P = 7.2 \u00d7 10\u221211) in ST18, rs2318131 (P = 3.3 \u00d7 10\u221212) near COPS8, rs60464047 (P = 6.7 \u00d7 10\u22129) in POU6F2, rs10752212 (P = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221210) near CELF2, rs6833641 (P = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22129) near ARAP2, rs17515225 and rs34311235 (independently associated, P = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 and 7.9 \u00d7 10\u22129, respectively) in LRP1B, rs1378552 (P = 4.3 \u00d7 10\u22129) in a gene desert on 4q34.3; and rs1782032 (P = 9 \u00d7 10\u22129) near TUSC1, and rs1847202 near SHQ1 and GXYLT2. Finally, rs997295 in MAP2K5 (P = 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22129) is in LD with rs2241423 (r2 \u2248 0.36), which is associated with body mass index (BMI). Some of these SNPs are in or near genes (PRDM16, NRF2, MAP2K5, NLGN1, RGS5) that have also been implicated in the vascular system.<SEP>Enrichment<SEP>Analysis of all regions with P < 10\u22125 using GREAT showed a significant enrichment in regions containing genes involved in fusion of atlas and occipital bones (FDR = 0.002) and abnormal arcus anterior morphology (FDR = 0.038) in mouse. The genes\/gene families annotated with one or both of these processes were HOXB, HOXD, TSHZ1 and RARB regions (the SNP near RARB is rs2067120, P = 8.2 \u00d7 10\u22126).<SEP>Phenotypic study of motion sickness<SEP>We investigated comorbidities with motion sickness within the 23andMe database. Briefly, we looked at partial correlations between each of 695 different phenotypes and motion sickness, controlling for age, sex (where applicable) and five principal components. Table 3 shows selected large correlations exceeding the Bonferroni threshold of P < 6 \u00d7 10\u22125. The maximum P-value for correlations included in the table was 4 \u00d7 10\u221224. Some of the associated phenotypes are known symptoms of motion sickness (e.g. headache) or established comorbidities (migraines, vertigo, PONV and morning sickness). In addition to PONV, other gastrointestinal (GI) phenotypes were also associated with motion sickness [e.g. irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); acid reflux; stomach upset with antidepressants, codeine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); and indigestion with dairy products]. Other associations include poor sleep, poor circulation, altitude sickness, hay fever and neuroticism. Phenotypes associated with lower risk for motion sickness include a history of tobacco use, a good sense of direction, higher BMI and a better ability to handle stress. <SEP>Genetic correlations between motion sickness and related phenotypes<SEP>We determined if any of the 35 SNPs associated with motion sickness were also associated with six correlated and clinically important phenotypes (PONV, migraines, hay fever, altitude sickness, morning sickness and vertigo) (Supplementary Material, Table S2). Table 4 shows SNPs associated with these phenotypes with a (Bonferroni-corrected) P-value under 0.05\/35 \u2248 0.0014 [under a more stringent threshold of 0.05\/(35 \u00d7 6) \u2248 0.0002 only the first two are significant]. One motion sickness-associated SNP was significantly associated with migraines: rs61759167 in PRDM16 (P = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126). A previous study reported an association between migraines and another SNP in PRDM16, rs2651899, which is in weak LD with rs61759167 (r2 \u2248 0.44). Three motion sickness-associated SNPs were also significantly associated with PONV: rs6833641 near ARAP2, rs1195218 near AUTS2 and rs6069325 near CBLN4. For all four examples, the higher risk allele for migraines or PONV is also the higher risk allele for motion sickness. We see an excess of associations with consistent direction of effect for PONV (27 consistent, P = 0.001) and vertigo (27 consistent, P = 0.001) and a similar trend for migraine (N = 23, P = 0.06). We did not detect individually significant associations between motion sickness-associated SNPs and altitude sickness, hay fever, morning sickness or vertigo. While these data suggest some shared etiology for motion sickness and PONV or migraines, it is difficult to assess whether or not this is due to shared causal SNPs. <SEP>Sex-specific effects<SEP>Motion sickness is much more common in women than in men (Table 1) and several of our SNPs show much stronger effects in women than in men. The SNP rs66800491 has a 1.5\u00d7 larger effect in women (\u22120.097 versus \u22120.062) and rs1847202 has a 3\u00d7 larger effect in women (0.048 versus 0.016) (both SNPs P < 0.05 for interaction, corrected for 35 tests). Overall 26 of the 35 SNPs have estimated larger effects in women than men (binomial P < 0.003; Supplementary Material, Table S3).","Results<SEP>Clinical examination<SEP>We were presented with a 12\u00a0year-old boy with hepatosplenomegaly and growth retardation at the Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Hunan, China in 2017 (Fig.\u00a01a). The clinical features include a rounded doll\u2019s face, fatty cheeks and protuberant abdomen (Fig. 1b). Based on examination on the proband\u2019s skeletal development by X-rays, his hip and wrist showed osteoporosis (Fig. 1c, d). In the upper liver, right intercostal midline sixth intercostal, liver rib length is 51\u00a0mm, thickness is 37\u00a0mm. Maximum oblique diameter of right liver is 159\u00a0mm, suggesting severe liver enlargement (Fig. 1d). Spleen is swollen to a thickness of 34\u00a0mm.<SEP>Additional biochemical assays were performed on the proband (Table 1). His fasting blood glucose value was 0.17\u00a0mmol\/l, which had reached a dangerously low value. Levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and chlorinum were abnormal. Investigation of liver function showed elevated aminotransferases (AST, ALT) and other biochemical abnormalities. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin were at normal levels. Altogether, these clinical and biochemical examinations indicated that the boy is likely to be affected with GSD-Ia.<SEP>The parents were non-consanguineous, and neither has any symptom of GSD-Ia (Fig. 1a). They came to Xiangya Hospital to seek help to obtain a genetic diagnosis and plan to have another child by in vitro fertilization (IVF). Given that GSD-Ia is a recessive disease, we hypothesized that the proband carries bi-allelic G6PC mutations inherited from the father and mother, respectively. Yielding a confirmed genetic diagnosis and determining the exact disease causal variants are necessary to perform preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) from in vitro fertilization (IVF).<SEP>Whole-exome and sanger sequencing identified one pathogenic variant<SEP>To confirm the clinical diagnosis, we conducted clinical exome sequencing on the proband. A novel missense mutation of the G6PC gene (c.326G\u2009>\u2009A) was identified by WES (Fig.\u00a02a), which appears to be homozygous and affects a highly conserved position in the protein sequence (Fig. 2b). Bioinformatics analysis by InterVar and manual examination of the ACMG-AMP 2015 guidelines determined the mutation to be likely pathogenic. We further validated the mutation by Sanger sequencing on all family members (Fig. 2c). However, the mutation was not detected in the father and was present in a heterozygous state in the mother (Fig. 2c). In order to examine whether germline mosaicism is present in the father, the DNA of the father\u2019s sperm was sequenced, but the results were largely inconclusive as a small peak for A allele and an even smaller peak for C allele is present at the c.326 position (Additional file 1: Figure S1).<SEP>Long-read sequencing identified a structural variant in the other allele<SEP>To evaluate whether a structural variant is present in the proband that masks the c.326G\u2009>\u2009A mutation as homozygous, we carried out long-read whole-genome sequencing on the proband using the Oxford Nanopore technology. We generated 2,251,269 base-called reads containing 35,595,548,336 bases (~12X whole-genome coverage) with an average read length of 16,579\u00a0bp. Using the long-read sequencing data, a novel deletion on chr17 g.41049904_41057049del7146 (GRCh37) was detected in one allele of G6PC (Fig.\u00a03a), and the known heterozygous point mutation c.326G\u2009>\u2009A was detected in the other allele. This deletion was supported by four reads, though with slightly discordant breakpoints due to possible alignment errors. The deletion completely covers the first two exons of the G6PC gene, thus resulting in loss of function.<SEP>By quantitative RT-PCR, we estimated the copy number of each exon of the G6PC gene from the proband and his parents (Fig. 3b). The copy numbers of deletion exon 1F (5\u2032-Flanking region), exon 1 and exon 2 were only about half of the value of the control group, which indicated that the patient and his father both carry a heterozygous deletion.<SEP>To further clarify the location of the breakpoint of this large deletion, we designed six breakpoint primers (Table 1) to amplify and sequence the suspected breakpoint region. The result confirmed our prediction and found the breakpoints precisely at chr17:41049879 and chr17:41057003 (Fig. 3c). These breakpoints were only 20-50\u00a0bp different from the predictions from the long-read sequencing data. This large deletion (chr17 g.41049879_41057003del7125) was thus 7125\u00a0bp in length and contains the 5\u2032 regulatory sequence as well as exon 1, intron 1, exon 2 and partial intron 2 of the G6PC gene (Fig. 3d). Motif analysis was performed and found that the 5\u2032 breakpoint was located in AluJr and the 3\u2032 breakpoint in AluSx (Fig. 3e). The Alu family members have a sequence similarity of over 87% and cover 11% of the human genome, and Alu-Alu recombination usually produces a fragment deletion via Alu recombination-mediated deletion (ARMD). Note that WES missed this deletion and judged the heterozygous missense mutation as homozygous, since we were unable to observe any obvious coverage differences between the several exons in the gene from WES (Fig. 2a). Therefore, the patient inherited the missense mutation (c.326G\u2009>\u2009A) from his mother and inherited the deletion mutation (chr17 g.41049879_41057003del7125) from his father. We further designed a PCR-based assay to easily differentiate samples with and without deletion using a set of primers (G6PC-Del-F\/G6PC-Del-R), which generates a 418\u00a0bp target fragments in individuals carrying the deletion (Fig. 3f).<SEP>Preimplantation genetic diagnosis and implantation of the embryo<SEP>In order to help the family to plan for another child, a reproductive intervention was carried out by in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). To avoid the allelic drop-out (ADO), microsatellite markers D17S760 (location 5\u2032 of G6PC, \u2212\u20090.9\u00a0M), DS17S793 (location 5\u2032 of G6PC, \u2212\u20090.7\u00a0M) and DS17S951 (location 3\u2032 of G6PC, 0.8\u00a0M) in linkage with the breakpoint junction and the point mutations were tested. Four embryos developed to blastocysts, and were collected and biopsied. The deletion mutation (chr17 g.41049879_41057003del7125) was not detected in four embryos, and we ruled out the possibility of allelic drop-out via linkage analysis by microsatellite markers. However, all the four embryos were identified to be carriers of the missense mutation (c.326G\u2009>\u2009A). Data on the STR sites D17S760, DS17S793 and DS17S951 also indicated that the embryo inherited the maternal risk chromosome (Additional file 1:\u00a0Table S2). Furthermore, three alleles of D17S760 were found in embryo No. 2, suggesting that it may be partial trisomy in chromosome 17. Considering the state of the four embryos comprehensively, embryo No. 1 was implanted (Additional file 1: Table S1).<SEP>After the implantation of the embryo, the patient\u2019s mother succeeded in pregnancy and came to our hospital for a review at the 19+ week of pregnancy. We obtained amniotic fluid cells of the fetus to extract DNA. The genetic testing confirmed that the fetus is a carrier of the missense mutation (c.326G\u2009>\u2009A), and does not inherit the deleterious deletion. The newborn was revisited in our hospital in December 2017. The baby had a fasting blood glucose level of 5.5\u00a0mmol\/L and her B-ultrasonogram showed that the liver and kidneys were normal (Additional file 1: Figure S2), confirming that she was not affected with GSD-Ia.","RESULTS<SEP>Baseline and Demographic Comparisons<SEP>Pre-test comparisons were conducted to determine whether the OPRM1 groups differed based on demographic and drinking variables. There were no significant OPRM1 genotype group differences across demographic variables (p\u2019s > 0.05). Results revealed significant genotype group differences across drinking variables, specifically AUDIT score, number of drinking days, and drinks per drinking day in the past 30 days. Table 1. All subsequent analyses controlled for these variables found to differ across OPRM1 genotype. Notably, coefficients did not change in statistical significance when comparing models including AUDIT score, drinking days, or drinks per drinking day as covariates. Therefore, all models included only drinking days as the representative covariate for OPRM1 genotype group differences in drinking. To further validate the main results, all analyses controlled for ALDH2 (rs671) and ADH1B (rs1229984) markers. Analyses of subjective response during the alcohol infusion session controlled for baseline (i.e. BrAC = 0.00 g\/dl) levels of subjective response on the corresponding outcome variable.<SEP>A series of Fisher\u2019s exact tests, non-parametric tests accounting for small cell sizes, were conducted to examine 24 possible side effects from the medication as indicated by the SAFTEE checklist. Results revealed a significant association between medication and drowsiness, which occurred in 20% of participants while on naltrexone in comparison to 7% while on placebo (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p = 0.05). There was also a significant medication association on ringing in the ears, which occurred in 3% of participants when taking naltrexone in comparison to 1% while taking placebo (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p = 0.03). There were no significant medication associations on the remaining 22 side effects measured by the SAFTEE (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p > 0.05), including nausea. There were also no significant differences in side effects as a function of OPRM1 genotype (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p > 0.05).<SEP>Pharmacogenetic Effects: Alcohol Craving<SEP>Analyses of alcohol-induced craving revealed no simple effect of genotype (b = 0.20, SE = 0.21, t = 0.96, p = 0.34), medication (b = \u22120.15, SE = 0.17, t = \u22120.86, p = 0.39), or medication \u00d7 genotype interaction (b = 0.15, SE = 0.21, t = 0.73, p = 0.47). There was not a significant medication \u00d7 genotype \u00d7 BrAC interaction (b = \u22120.20, SE = 0.13, t = \u22121.52, p = 0.13). As expected, there was an effect of BrAC (b = 0.13, SE = 0.06, t = 2.10, p = 0.04), such that participants reported higher levels of alcohol craving across rising BrAC levels. Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = 0.02) and baseline AUQ values (p < 0.01). Current cigarette smoking status, defined using a binary variable (i.e., 0 = non-smoker and 1 = smoker), was not a significant moderator of any of these effects (p \u2265 0.28).<SEP>Pharmacogenetic Effects: Subjective Response to Alcohol<SEP>Analyses of alcohol-induced sedation revealed no simple effect of genotype (b = \u22120.11, SE = 0.37, t = \u22120.30, p = 0.77), medication (b = 0.14, SE = 0.23, t = 0.61, p = 0.55), or medication \u00d7 genotype interaction (b = \u22120.21, SE = 0.29, t = \u22120.72, p = 0.47). There was not a significant three-way interaction across medication \u00d7 genotype \u00d7 BrAC (b = 0.28, SE = 0.21, t = 1.30, p = 0.19). There was an effect of BrAC (b = 0.30, SE = 0.15, t = 2.02, p = 0.04) with participants reporting greater sedation across rising BrAC levels. Significant covariates included ADH1B genotype (p = 0.01) and baseline sedation values (p < 0.01). Nicotine smoking status was not a significant moderator of any of these effects (p \u2265 0.11).<SEP>Analyses of alcohol-induced stimulation revealed no simple effect of medication (b = 0.16, SE = 0.13, t = 1.20, p = 0.23), genotype (b = 0.37, SE = 0.22, t = 1.69, p = 0.09), or medication \u00d7 genotype (b = 0.04, SE = 0.21, t = 0.20, p = 0.84). There was however a significant three-way interaction across medication \u00d7 genotype \u00d7 BrAC (b = \u22120.32, SE = 0.16, t = \u22121.93, p = 0.05); see Figure 3. Follow-up post-hoc analyses examined the effect of BrAC in each of the four medication \u00d7 genotype groups. These post-hoc tests revealed significant positive effects of BrAC effects in all groups (p\u2019s < 0.01), with the exception of the Asn40 homozygotes + placebo group (p = 0.10). Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = 0.03) and baseline stimulation values (p < 0.01). Nicotine smoking status was not a significant moderator of any of these effects (p \u2265 0.14).<SEP>Pharmacogenetic Effects: Alcohol Self-Administration<SEP>Poisson regression analyses for total number of drinks consumed revealed no significant main effect of medication (F (1,71) = 2.24, p = 0.14, naltrexone mean = 0.93, SD = 1.35 versus placebo mean = 1.19, SD = 1.43). There was a significant main effect of genotype (F (1,71) = 5.79, p = 0.02) such that Asp40 carriers consumed significantly fewer drinks (mean = 0.80, SD = 1.27) in comparison to Asn40 homozygotes (mean = 1.51, SD = 1.49). There was no significant medication \u00d7 genotype interaction (F (1,70) = 0.68, p = 0.41). Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = .05). Smoking status was trending towards predicting greater self-administration (F(1,68)=3.87, p = 0.053), such that non-smokers consumed 0.83 (SD = 1.27) drinks versus 1.41 (SD = 1.50) for smokers. Smoking status did not moderate or affect any medication or genotype effects (p \u2265 0.25).<SEP>The distribution of latency to first drink was non-normal. Collapsed across medication conditions and genotype groups, 29% consumed their first drink immediately (within the first three minutes), 18% consumed their first drink at some point during the session (but not immediately), and 53% abstained during the entire session. Cox proportional regression models revealed no significant main effect of medication on latency to first drink (Wald \u03c72 = 2.58, p = 0.10, HR = .67); however, there was a significant main effect of genotype on latency to first drink (Wald \u03c72 = 3.39, p = 0.03, HR = 1.89) such that Asn40 homozygotes had a significantly shorter latency to first drink, Figure 4. When medication \u00d7 genotype interaction was added to the models (Figure 5), the effect of genotype was no longer significant (p = 0.12) nor was the medication \u00d7 genotype interaction (p = 0.63). There were no significant covariates across either model (p\u2019s > 0.09). Smoking status was associated with marginally shorter latency to drink (Wald \u03c72 = 2.61, p = 0.07) but did not moderate the effects of genotype or medication (p \u2265 0.40).<SEP>Treating OPRM1 genotype as a three-level variable did not significantly alter the pharmacogenetic results reported above.","Results<SEP>Population and average attributable fractions<SEP>Male sex had the largest PAF and AAF (64.3 to 75.6%, and 29.8 to 30.9%, respectively, in cohorts 1 to 3), being overweight or obese had the second largest measures (PAF\u2009=\u200959.2 to 68.6%, AAF\u2009=\u200923.5 to 26.2%), and inheriting the SLC2A9 rs12498742 A-allele had the third largest effect (PAF\u2009=\u200956.6 to 63.8%, AAF\u2009=\u200922.0 to 23.5%). All other factors had PAFs <\u200925% and AAFs <\u200910% (Table 2). Cohorts 2 and 3 had the same ranking of risk factors (sex > BMI\u2009>\u2009rs12498742\u2009>\u2009diet adherence > alcohol consumption > diuretic therapy > age), while cohort 1 ranked the same three risk factors first (sex > BMI\u2009>\u2009rs12498742), before differing in rankings of the remaining four risk factors (diuretic therapy > diet adherence > age\u2009>\u2009alcohol consumption) (Fig. 1).<SEP>In the gout cohort, lack of treatment with urate-lowering therapy had the second largest PAF of 63.2%, after sex (76.7%) (Table 2). The PAFs for BMI and SLC2A9 rs12498742 were lower than for the non-gout cohorts (57 to 69% in non-gout and 48 to 49% in gout), and non-adherence to the Healthy Eating Pyramid guidelines was 21.4% in non-gout (cohort 3) and 11.8% in gout. Average attributable fraction values showed a similar trend (Fig. 1).<SEP>In sex-stratified analysis in the non-gout cohorts, PAFs for rs12498742 were 77.7 to 96.4% in women compared to 49.2 to 58.9% in men (Table S1). Alcohol was not a risk factor in women across all cohorts, nor age in men in cohorts 2 and 3, and gout (Table S1; 95% CI encompassed 1.0). The lower age limit for recruitment into the UK Biobank, which these two cohorts were derived from, was 40\u2009years, which may have influenced the calculation.<SEP>In the non-gout cohorts, of 30 genetically-independent serum urate-associated genetic variants chosen as having the top effects by GWAS evaluated (Table S2), the SLC2A9 rs12498742 variant was the largest, with PAFs ranging from 28.5 to 32.1% and AAFs from 22.0 to 23.5%. For comparative purposes, we summed the PAFs for genetic variants, assuming that the variants act independently of each other to influence the risk of HU, with the individual PAFs summing to >\u2009141% (cohort 1 was 146.2%, cohort 2 was 143.7%, cohort 3 was 141.3%). Summing the AAFs (equivalent to the summing of PAFs, above) resulted in all three cohorts having a summed AAF over 87% (cohort 1 was 97.9%, cohort 2 was 87.1%, cohort 3 was 101.6%). Summed attributable fractions for genetic variants for HU were considerably lower for the gout cohort (PAF was 77.6% and AAF was 44.0%), possibly reflecting selection (collider) bias.<SEP>Percent variance explained for serum urate levels<SEP>In the non-gout cohorts, sex had the most percent variance explained (22 to 27%) (Table 3). The dichotomised BMI exposure was consistently 7 to 9%, with diuretic exposure accounting for 12% variance in the US-based cohort and 4\u20135% in the UK-derived cohorts. The diet estimate was \u22640.1% and SLC2A9 was 2\u20133%, similar to our previous report. The gout cohort included urate-lowering therapy exposure in the model, with exposure accounting for the largest proportion (35%) of variance, approximately 10-fold more than any other variable. The use of percent variance explained produced a broadly similar ranking order of risk factors to the PAF and AAF analyses across all four cohorts (Fig. 1). <SEP>Mendelian randomisation<SEP>Five of the 87 single foods and principal component-derived dietary-associated habits provided evidence of a causal effect (IVW P\u2009<\u20090.05\/87 (5.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20094)) on urate levels by inverse-variance-weighted MR (Table S3). All five of these dietary habits also had no evidence for an intercept significantly different from zero in the MR Egger analysis (all P\u2009>\u20090.05) indicating no evidence for directional (horizontal) pleiotropy. Four of these dietary habits provided evidence for a causal role (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and yielded similar effect sizes in the weighted median analysis (Table\u00a04). Two of these causal effects were with dairy-related dietary habits (preferentially drinking skim milk and preferentially drinking milk with a higher fat content), and the other two causal effects were for consuming tub margarine and daily dried fruit consumption. <SEP>Of the 39 genetic variants that comprised the four dietary-associated habits, 21 are associated with metabolic traits (http:\/\/www.type2diabetesgenetics.org\/ [accessed: 2nd June 2020]) and\/or traits available in the UKBiobank PheWeb (http:\/\/pheweb.sph.umich.edu:5000 [accessed: June 2, 2020]), including 16 specifically associated with BMI or a related body fat trait (Table S4). To test the possibility that the causal association between these four dietary habits and urate levels is due to BMI as a common upstream cause (e.g. change in dietary habits due to weight-loss advice), we applied multivariable MR using the same individual level UK Biobank dataset described in ref.. For all four dietary patterns, including BMI in the multivariable analysis resulted in no evidence for a causal effect (P\u2009\u2265\u20090.06), BMI showing a causal relationship with urate levels independent of the dietary habit (Fig.\u00a02). Bidirectional MR between BMI and each of the four dietary habits where, by inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis MR BMI was tested for a causal effect on the dietary habits and each of the dietary habits was tested for a causal effect on BMI, conducted to confirm whether BMI is a common upstream cause of dietary habits, provided evidence in both directions (P\u2009\u2264\u20094.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u200918 for BMI to dietary habit, P\u2009\u2264\u20099.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20094 for dietary habit to BMI)\u2014a situation termed \u201ccorrelated pleiotropy\u201d \u2014except in the margarine analysis for the BMI to dietary habit analysis (P\u2009=\u20090.24) although there was evidence for the dietary habit to BMI analysis (P\u2009=\u20098.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u200961). This indicates that BMI and the four dietary habits are strongly correlated traits or work through a shared pathway and that the four dietary habits have no effect on urate levels independent of BMI.
