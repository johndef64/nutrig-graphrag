["3. Results<SEP>3.1. The Clinical and Genetic Characteristics of Patients with ABCC8-NDM Described in Previous Studies<SEP>We have systematically reviewed the literature reporting variants in ABCC8-NDM. 175 probands with ABCC8-NDM (including 139 patients with heterozygous variants, 21 patients with homozygous variants, one patient with a mosaic variant, and 14 patients with compound heterozygous variants) variants were found owing to 110 ABCC8 (Table 1). Among those probands, 66 patients were reported as having transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, 92 as having permanent neonatal diabetes, and 17 as having an unknown type of diabetes due to a lack of follow-up. These variants caused ABCC8-NDM with either a dominant or recessive genetic pattern and were scattered throughout the functional regions of the gene (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1).<SEP>All these patients presented with impaired insulin secretion, and 18 of the 110 variants were confirmed to be activating in functional studies and affect the channel inhibition by different molecular mechanisms. Then, those variants led to impaired insulin secretion and diabetes, as shown in Table 1.<SEP>The birth weight of 99 probands was available. Thirty-two probands (32%) had a birth weight < 2,500\u2009g, and only one proband (1%) had a birth weight of >4,000\u2009g. Forty-three of the 175 (24.6%) probands with ABCC8-NDM had neurological manifestations. In addition, 21 (12.0%) patients had developmental delay and epilepsy syndrome (DEND), 5 (2.9%) patients had intermediate DEND syndrome, 5 (2.9%) had seizures, and 12 (6.9%) had other neurological symptoms. This was similar to the previous study reporting approximately 20% of patients with KATP channel variants developed neurological symptoms. The variants reportedly associated with the neurological phenotype were across all functional regions of the ABCC8 gene.<SEP>3.2. The Genetic Characteristics of Patients with ABCC8-NNDM Reported in Previous Studies<SEP>After systematical reviewing the literature related to the ABCC8-NNDM studies, 87 probands were identified with 71 ABCC8 genetic variant alleles, including 75 patients with heterozygous variants, four with homozygous variants, and eight with compound heterozygous variants (Table 2, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1). The domains where the variants are located have been displayed in Table 2. By available data and bioinformatics analysis, 47 and 15 variants of the 71 variant alleles were classified as likely pathogenic and pathogenic, respectively, while nine variants were of uncertain significance (VUS) (Supplementary Table 2).<SEP>Nine (including p.Y356C, p.R370S, p.L582V, p.R825W, p.R1182Q, p.P1198L, p.R1418H, p.R1420H, and p.E1506K) of 71 genetic variant alleles were confirmed to be activating or inactivating through functional studies (Table 2). Among them, five activating variants (p.Y356C, p.L582V, p.R825W, p.R1182Q, and p.P1198L) have been demonstrated that channel inhibition by ATP was reduced and less insulin was secreted. The remaining four inactivating variants (p.R370S, p.E1506K, p.R1418H, and p.R1420H) were found to decrease KATP channel activity and bring about diabetes. The patients with inactivating variants had hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in early life and progressed to diabetes later.<SEP>In addition, twelve variants (including p.A269D, p.G296R, p.R306H, p.C435R, p.L582V, p.V607M, p.R825W, p.R1182W, p.R1182Q, p.P1198L, p.F1067I, and p.R1379H) of ABCC8 were reported both in patients with ABCC8-NDM and in those with ABCC8-NNDM (Table 2 and Figure 1). The above variants were located in the domains of the L0 linker region (L0), transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1), nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1), transmembrane domain 2 (TMD2), and nucleotide-binding domain 2 (NBD2) (Figure 1). The same variant could cause different onset ages of diabetes.<SEP>3.2.1. Evolutionary Conservation of Sites of Variants Both in Patients with ABCC8-NDM and in Those Patients with ABCC8-NNDM<SEP>The conservation analysis was carried out using ClustalW and ESPript 3.0 tools. Multiple sequence alignments of ABCC8 in the vertebrate species were selected for this analysis to show the sequence conservation of amino acid residues between them (Figure 2). It has been demonstrated that the amino acid residues of these twelve variants of ABCC8 both in ABCC8-NDM and ABCC8-NNDM in the literature were conserved across the organisms queried.<SEP>3.2.2. ABCC8-NNDM due to Gain-of-Function and Loss-of-Function of Variants<SEP>Previous studies reported that both gain-of-function and loss-of-function variants in ABCC8 could cause diabetes. The first loss-of-function ABCC8 variant was a heterozygous inactivating ABCC8 p.E1506K variant, which presented with HH, followed by glucose intolerance and diabetes in later life. This distinct phenotype was demonstrated in a mouse model carrying the p.E1506K variant of ABCC8 and in patients carrying other rare variants of ABCC8, such as p.R370S, p.R1418H, and p.R1420H. Two Japanese probands with hypoglycemia in infancy due to heterozygous inactivating variants progressing to hyperglycemia were also reported. Therefore, the subtype of ABCC8-NNDM due to inactivating variants could implicate the etiology of diabetes.<SEP>Among the 87 probands previously reported, 24% (21\/87) carried inactivating ABCC8 variants reported in hyperinsulinemia, whereas 24% (21\/87) carried activating ABCC8 variants were also associated with NDM. And the remaining 52% (45\/87) carried variants with undetermined molecular mechanism. In the previously reported cases of ABCC8-NNDM, it was estimated to be ~25% patients with activating ABCC8 variants and ~25% with inactivating variants. The molecular mechanisms of the remaining ~50% variants were needed further investigation.<SEP>3.2.3. The Clinical Characteristics of Patients with ABCC8-NNDM Reported in Previous Studies<SEP>A total of 144 patients with ABCC8 variants including the probands and their hyperglycemic relatives (125 Caucasians, 15 East Asians, three Africans, and one Chinese) were analyzed. The clinical and genetic characteristics of them are shown in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1. The diagnosed age was reported in 71 probands. Among them, three (4%) were diagnosed with diabetes when <6 years old, 28 (39%) when 6\u201318 years old, and 40 (56%) when 18\u201340 years old. According to their body mass index (BMI) at diabetes onset, 10 (27%) of the 37 patients (seven probands and three relatives) who were diagnosed when \u226518 years old were overweight or obese. According to the available data, 30 patients were described using sulfonylureas (SUs) for glucose control. 22\/30 (73.3%) patients have shown to be effective with SUs, while the levels of HbA1c were less than 7.0%. We found that just three probands with ABCC8 variants, including compound variants of p.H103Y and p.R74Q and missense variants of p.A1457T and p.E1506K, had microalbuminuria. Reilly et al. have described that retinopathy was also common microvascular complication and that 5 out 10 patients with ABCC8 variants had diabetic retinopathy. A similar case was reported by Ovsyannikova et al., where the patient was diagnosed with diabetes at age 27 years (p.A1457T variant in ABCC8), and during the initial investigation, he had nonproliferative retinopathy and a raised microalbumin creatinine ratio.<SEP>As is known to all, neurological features are essential for ABCC8-NDM, and forty-three (24.6%) probands had neurological manifestations among the 175 reported probands with ABCC8-NDM according to the published literature. In the ABCC8-NNDM group, just one proband with the variant of p.A1457T had epilepsy independent of hypoglycemia, and two probands with the variants of p.R1418H and p.R1420H had seizure due to hypoglycemia. Compared with the ABCC8-NDM group, the frequency of the neurological phenotype in the ABCC8-NNDM group was significantly lower (1\/87 (1%) vs. 43\/175 (24.6%), P\u2009<0.001), and we did not include neurological features due to hypoglycemia.<SEP>We have descripted above that there were 24% probands carrying activating variants, 24% carried inactivating variants, and 52% carrying undetermined variants among the 87 probands. Based on the available data, we further compared the clinical features between the probands with activating and inactivating variants. There was no significant difference in diagnosed age and BMI between the two groups (diagnosed age: 28.9 \u00b1 11.6, n = 14 vs. 19.1 \u00b1 10.0, n = 0.981, P = 0.960; diagnosed BMI: 22.5 \u00b1 3.3, n = 6 vs. 22.5 \u00b1 4.3, n = 9, P = 0.981). Among the inactivating group, two probands with the variants of p.R1418H and p.R1420H had seizures due to hypoglycemia, while no probands were reported with neurological symptoms among the activating group. And one proband with inactivating p.E1506K variant had microalbuminuria. In addition, the prevalence of hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia was significantly higher in the inactivating group than the activating group (13\/21 (61.9%) vs. 0\/21 (0.0%), P < 0.001).","RESULTS<SEP>Association studies between SNPs and glucose-related variables.<SEP>Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of the HELENA study participants. The mean age was 14.7 \u00b1 1.4 years, and 48% were boys. We tested the associations between the 17 tag SNPs (3 genotyped and 14 imputed) and anthropometric parameters, biochemical parameters, and the HOMA-B and HOMA-IR indices. No significant associations were detected with the anthropometric phenotypes or with the plasma lipid variables (data not shown). In contrast, significant associations were observed between rs340838 and fasting plasma insulin levels (P = 2.95 \u00d7 10\u22123). Carriers of the major T allele of rs340838 had lower insulin levels than those homozygous for the minor allele (\u03b2 = \u22120.90 \u00b1 0.32 \u00b5IU\/mL). To better define this association signal, all 80 SNPs were tested with plasma insulin levels (Fig. 1). Two other SNPs (rs340837 and rs340836) were significantly associated with plasma insulin levels, with the best association detected for rs340837 (P = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22123) (Fig. 1 and Table 3). The rs340873 and rs340872 SNPs also tended to be associated with insulin levels (P = 0.0043). Consistently, the insulin-lowering alleles of the rs340838, rs340837, and rs340836 SNPs tended to be associated with lower HOMA-B (0.0060 \u2264 P \u2264 0.0098) and lower HOMA-IR (0.0054 \u2264 P \u2264 0.0071) (Table 3). Of note, the GWAS top hit SNP (rs340874) was not significantly associated with plasma glucose level, insulin level, HOMA-B, or HOMA-IR (P = 0.56, 0.096, 0.11, and 0.19, respectively) (Table 3), but the data are in line with those of Barker et al. because the carriers of the rs340874 C glucose-raising allele had lower HOMA-B than the carriers of the other allele (P = 0.11) (Table 3), especially in girls (P = 0.033) (data not shown).<SEP>Luciferase assays.<SEP>To identify the functional SNPs responsible of the association with FI levels, we characterized the functionality of the three insulin-associated SNPs as well as of all the SNPs in strong LD (r2 > 0.80) with them (i.e., rs340875, rs340873, rs340872, rs340839, and rs340835) (SNPs shown in red in Fig. 1 and in blocks 4 and 11 in Table 1). We also tested the functional impact of the GWAS top hit SNP (rs340874). Because these nine SNPs are located in the 5\u2032 region or in intron 1 of PROX1, they may modulate PROX1 transcription. To investigate this hypothesis, we subcloned into the pGL4-minP luciferase reporter vector oligonucleotides (60 bp) encompassing the alleles of the nine SNPs and assessed in vitro the impact of these SNPs on luciferase activity using transient transfection assays in two different cell lines. MIN6 cells were used as a model of pancreatic \u03b2-cells, and because PROX1 plays a role in liver morphogenesis, an organ involved in glucose homeostasis, we also used HepG2 cells.<SEP>Among the nine SNPs, three presented significant allelic expression differences (Fig. 2). The rs340873 A allele was associated with a 1.5-fold (P = 0.004) and twofold (P = 0.02) lower luciferase activity in MIN6 and HepG2 cells, respectively. The rs340835 A allele was associated with a 3.4-fold (P = 0.05) and 4.2-fold (P = 0.02) lower luciferase activity in MIN6 and HepG2 cells, respectively. In addition, the rs340874 C allele was associated with a 1.65-fold (P = 0.05) lower luciferase activity in HepG2 cells only. These results suggest that PROX1 expression may be lower in the pancreas and liver of individuals carrying the insulin-lowering alleles.<SEP>EMSAs.<SEP>To investigate whether the differences in luciferase activities observed were a result of differential TF binding to PROX1 risk alleles, we performed EMSAs with nuclear protein extracts of HepG2 and MIN6 cells. Probes that contained both alleles of the three SNPs were used. No DNA-protein complex could be detected with MIN6 or INS-1E extracts (data not shown). In contrast, DNA-protein complexes were observed for the rs340874, rs340873, and rs340835 probes with HepG2 extracts (Fig. 3). Each DNA-protein complex was specific because it was inhibited by specific unlabeled oligonucleotide probes. Allele binding differences could be detected for the rs340874 SNP only, with a 60% higher affinity for the rs340874 C allele than for the T allele. We conducted an in silico search with Genomatix software to examine whether the SNP modified any TF binding sites, but no putative TF was described at rs340874. Two TF binding sites for rs340873 and rs340835 could be detected, but neither seemed particularly relevant in type 2 diabetes (Table 4).<SEP>Prox1 and GSIS.<SEP>To investigate the possible consequence of a lower expression of Prox1 in \u03b2-cells and to assess whether Prox1 could play a role in GSIS, we knocked down Prox1 expression by siRNAs in INS-1E cells. After transfection with Prox1 siRNAs or NT siRNAs for 48 h, INS-1E cells were treated for 1 h with 3 or 30 mmol\/L glucose. Knock down of Prox1 expression was verified at the mRNA and protein level. Cells transfected with Prox1 siRNAs showed 40% less Prox1 mRNA (data not shown) and fewer proteins (Fig. 4A) than cells transfected with NT siRNAs. Only 40% of the inhibition of Prox1 could be obtained despite the use of 1) the optimal conditions based on the cyclophilin B positive control siRNA data and the Prox1 siRNAs and 2) a pool of four different Prox1 siRNAs. Of note, Prox1 siRNAs had no effect on cyclophilin B mRNA expression levels. After the cells were stimulated with either 3 or 30 mmol\/L glucose, insulin level was measured in the supernatant. Knock down of Prox1 mRNA expression levels resulted in a 1.7-fold decreased GSIS in Prox1 siRNA cells compared with NT siRNA cells (P = 0.029) (Fig. 4B), indicating that Prox1 stimulates GSIS in \u03b2-cells in normal conditions.<SEP>Regulation of Prox1 expression by glucose.<SEP>Because type 2 diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia, we investigated whether the expression of Prox1 could be regulated by glucose concentration in INS-1E cells. These cells were cultured for 24 or 48 h in medium containing 3 or 30 mmol\/L glucose. Total RNA was extracted, and Prox1 mRNA level was quantified relative to that of TFIIB. High concentrations of glucose (30 mmol\/L) repressed Prox1 expression to \u223c20 and 45% (both P = 0.029) of the expression at 3 mmol\/L glucose at 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig. 5A). As a positive control of the treatment, L-PK mRNA expression was quantified and, as expected, was induced approximately sevenfold (P < 0.05) on exposure to 30 mmol\/L glucose (data not shown). To check that a high glucose concentration would also modify Prox1 protein levels, nuclear protein extracts were prepared from the same samples (Prox1 protein being too weakly detected in total protein extracts). In contrast to the mRNA level, at the protein level, a high concentration of glucose upregulated Prox1 expression by \u223c20 (P = 0.20) and 50% (P = 0.11) at 24 and 48 h, respectively, relative to the values at 3 mmol\/L (Fig. 5B).","Main findings of Qi et al.<SEP>Qi et al. found that the MetS reversion rate (proportion of subjects with MetS at baseline but reverted at 6 months or 2 years) was higher in the high-fat diet group compared with the low-fat group over the 2-year intervention in A-allele carriers at rs1522813 (P = 0.002), while no differences were found between the low- and high-fat diet groups among the GG genotype. The age-, sex-, ethnicity-, and body weight changes\u2013adjusted odds ratio for 2-year MetS reversion for the high-fat compared with low-fat group was 2.88 (95% CI 1.25\u20136.67; P = 0.01) for A-allele carriers (P = 0.04 for genotype\u2013diet interaction). These results did not change after adjustment for physical activity or changes in insulin resistance. The authors concluded that their findings provide supportive evidence for the notion of personalized dietary intervention in the management of MetS.<SEP>The study appears to be the first to examine gene\u2013diet interactions on changes in MetS status in a large, long-term randomized dietary intervention. It represents an example of how trait responses to an intervention may be conditioned by genotype, emphasizing the importance of individual-level compared with population-level data when examining responses to standardized interventions. However, despite the positive findings and strengths of the POUNDS LOST trial, several limitations of the current study warrant further discussion.<SEP>Power and sample size<SEP>Statistical power and multiple testing are important considerations when evaluating genetic association studies. The authors acknowledged that they likely lacked the statistical power to detect the modest genetic associations and interactions they found for MetS reversion. In the current study, only 342 subjects had MetS at baseline and thus were eligible for analyses involving MetS reversion. Furthermore, they had a maximum sample size of 185 for the GG genotype and 157 for A-allele carriers. There was also an approximately 24% dropout from baseline to 2 years, further reducing the sample size.<SEP>The authors tested associations at two variants near IRS1 but did not account for multiple testing, as a P value \u2264 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Correcting for the fact that two variants were tested would result in a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P = 0.025 for statistical significance. Furthermore, the authors conducted numerous statistical tests across many traits. The results in Table 2 show that 22 statistical tests were performed for the association of rs1522813 genotype with various traits, while Supplementary Table 1 shows 24 additional tests. It can be assumed these tests were also performed for the rs2943641 genotype, resulting in approximately 100 total statistical tests and a Bonferroni multiple testing corrected threshold of about P = 0.0005. Using this threshold, none of the reported associations in the study would be considered statistically significant.<SEP>Association of IRS1 with metabolic traits<SEP>Variants in or near the IRS1 gene have been associated with MetS and several of its components. Furthermore, several studies have reported significant genotype\u2013diet interactions between variants in or near IRS1 and dietary factors on metabolic traits, including the POUNDS LOST study. The rs2943641 and rs1522813 variants tested by Qi et al. are located approximately 500 kb and 660 kb from IRS1, respectively, which is quite remote from the associated gene transcript. It is not clear whether these variants are in linkage disequilibrium with IRS1 variants and\/or related to IRS1 function. Teslovich et al. noted that variation at rs2972146, a variant associated with metabolic traits in recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), correlated with IRS1 expression in omental fat, despite being located 495 kb away from the IRS1 gene.<SEP>Recent GWAS reports have identified over 20 loci associated with MetS at the genome-wide level, a list that does not include IRS1. Although loci identified in observational GWAS are not always associated with trait responses to interventions, the inclusion of only variants near IRS1 and the modest effect sizes reported in the current study should be viewed with healthy skepticism. Furthermore, the POUNDS LOST group itself has reported elsewhere that variation in at least six different genes modulates the association between dietary composition and changes in metabolic traits. Thus, it is clear that no single gene or variant is likely responsible for interindividual differences in the response of MetS and its components to dietary interventions.<SEP>Outlook for nutrigenetic studies<SEP>The article by Qi et al. represents an opportunity to discuss the conditions necessary to identify genotype\u2013nutrition interaction effects on metabolic traits. Multiple challenges have to be met for nutrigenetic studies to be successful. First, the true magnitude of a gene\u2013nutrition interaction effect is not likely to be revealed by observational studies. Only intervention studies in which compliance with the experimental dietary exposure is not in doubt have the potential to uncover the complex relationships between DNA sequence variants in critical genes and a given nutrient or combination of nutrients and their effects on metabolic traits of interest. Second, in studies dealing with differential exposures to macronutrients, it is a major challenge to isolate the macronutrient truly responsible for the nutrigenetic effects, particularly for fat and carbohydrates as they tend to be manipulated in such a way that one is compensated by the other. The problem is thought to be greatly diminished when the dietary exposure pertains to other nutrients. Third, the challenge relating to sample size and statistical power as emphasized above. Based on this issue alone, it is likely that the vast majority of the nutrigenetic findings reported to date are false (see reference for a discussion). It is a challenge to design large-scale human nutrigenetic experiments and an even more daunting task to get them adequately funded in the current environment, but unfortunately there is no true substitute.<SEP>In brief, it is possible that calorically restricted high-fat diets designed to induce weight loss are more effective in the management of nascent metabolic disorders compared with low-fat diets in people carrying the A-allele at the rs1522813 polymorphic site in the vicinity of the IRS1 gene, but the evidence available to that effect remains inconclusive at this time.<SEP>See QI et al., P. ","3. Results<SEP>The detailed results on how the DI affected anthropometric parameters, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism, have been described elsewhere. Here we focus on the inflammation biomarkers. We first analyzed how the usual intake of different types of fat affected baseline values of inflammation biomarkers in a group of postmenopausal women with central obesity. Transcription levels of IL6 and TNF in PBMCs before the DI were not affected by baseline energy intake from fat, total fat intake, PUFA, or MUFA intake. However, lower intake of SFA was associated with an over 500 times lower TNF transcription (p < 0.05). Specifically, the median values of the TNF relative transcription levels were 0.000576 and 0.000001, in the low and high SFA groups, respectively. The amount of baseline energy intake from fat affected the initial IL6 concentrations (p < 0.05). Specifically, the high energy intake from fat was associated with higher IL6 levels (see Table 2). Moreover, high energy intake from protein resulted in higher blood TNF\u03b1 concentrations (p < 0.01). The intake of SFA, MUFA or PUFA did not affect IL6 or TNF\u03b1 levels (Table 3).<SEP>We also examined the associations between the IL6 polymorphism and baseline anthropometric and lipid parameters or inflammation biomarkers. The genotype frequencies for rs1800795 were 0.25 (GG), 0.56 (GC), and 0.19 (CC), and the allele frequencies were 0.53 (G) and 0.47 (C). The IL6 genotype groups differed in transcription levels at baseline, but only when SFA intake was considered (p < 0.05). Specifically, when SFA intake was high, the transcription level was over three times higher in the C-allele carriers group than in the GG genotype group. There was no effect of IL6 polymorphism on the anthropometric parameters (Table 4). Lower total cholesterol and LDL-C concentrations were observed in the GG genotype group (p < 0.01 for both associations; Table 4). These associations were also observed after adjustments for PA and BMI. The IL6 genotype was not associated with concentrations of any of the measured inflammation biomarkers.<SEP>The last step of the study was to determine how the dietary intervention affected inflammation biomarkers and whether the effect was dependent on the type of diet (CED or MED). <SEP>We measured TNF and IL6 genes expression in PBMCs, and the transcription levels of the TNF gene decreased in both groups after the dietary intervention, but it was statistically significant only in the CED group (p < 0.05; Figure 2a) or when both groups were analyzed together (p < 0.001). Both types of dietary intervention also led to a decrease in blood TNF\u03b1 concentration\u2014in the CED by 9% and in the MED group by 17.5% (Figure 2b). However, the type of diet used had no significant effect on the results. TNF\u03b1 concentrations before and after the dietary intervention were correlated: 0.58 and 0.60 in the CED and the MED group, respectively (p < 0.001). <SEP>IL6 gene transcription levels were not significantly affected by any of the diets (Figure 3a). We also did not observe any significant decrease in blood IL6 concentrations, in either the CED or the MED group (Figure 3b). The only correlation between gene expression and blood cytokine concentrations was a reverse correlation between TNF transcription and TNF\u03b1 concentrations before the intervention (r = \u22120.45, p < 0.05).","RESULTS<SEP>Between January 2000 and August 2010, 1034 adult motor vehicle accident autopsies were performed within the aforementioned counties in Kansas and Missouri. After excluding nonalcoholics with positive drug screens, intermediate BAC, prolonged hospitalization, or severely burned and\/or decomposed bodies, 736 cases were eligible for study inclusion. Of these cases, 68% were men and 63% were nonalcoholic. Half of the male cases and two-thirds of the alcoholic cases were randomly selected for inclusion (n = 471). The final analysis included 405 cases with tissue blocks available for staining and genotyping. There were 170 alcoholic cases and 235 nonalcoholic cases. The distribution of the rs738409 genotype was 233 subjects with CC, 141 CG, and 31 GG (Table 1). The distribution of the rs738409 genotype by race and ethnicity was shown in Table 2.<SEP>Potential bias<SEP>Although cases with hospitalization over 24 h have been excluded, the prevalence of steatosis does not differ if the victim died at the scene. The prevalence of steatosis and fibrosis did not differ if the victim is a driver, passenger, or pedestrian.<SEP>Effect of age and gender<SEP>The prevalence of steatosis, NAS, and fibrosis peaked between 45 and 54 years of age, and then decreased with advancing age (Figure 1a, b). Therefore, direct age standardization with the year 2000 census was used for prevalence estimates. The interaction term age2 was highly significant (< 0.0001) and therefore included in all multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses. Women obesity, and genotype groups is shown in Figure 2. The interaction terms among alcohol, BMI, and genotype were not significant (alcohol\u00d7BMI, P = 0.56; alcohol\u00d7genotype, P = 0.67; BMI\u00d7genotype, P = 0.95). This study had 80% power to detect had similar NAS compared to men (odds ratio (OR), 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54\u20131.3) and less fibrosis (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30\u20130.83).<SEP>NAS<SEP>Overall, the age-standardized prevalence of hepatic steatosis was 56% in the alcoholic cases and 36% in the nonalcoholic cases. The prevalence of steatohepatitis was 6 and 4%, respectively. The distribution of hepatic steatosis and NAS in the alcoholic, obesity, and genotype groups is shown in Figure 2. The interaction terms among alcohol, BMI, and genotype were not significant (alcohol\u00d7BMI, P = 0.56; alcohol\u00d7genotype, P = 0.67; BMI\u00d7genotype, P = 0.95). This study had 80% power to detect an interaction if the interaction carried an additional fourfold odds. The rs738409 GC or GG genotypes were associated with 1.9-fold odds (95% CI, 1.2\u20132.9) of a higher NAS. When GC and GG were analyzed separately, there appears to be a small incremental increase in odds from GC (OR 1.8) to GG (OR 2.2). Alcohol had 3.5-fold odds (95% CI, 2.0\u20135.9), while every 5-unit increase in BMI had 1.9-fold odds (95% CI 1.7\u20132.5).<SEP>In terms of the point estimate of individual histological features comprising the NAS, alcohol was associated with 3.6-fold odds for macrovesicular steatosis, 2.9-fold odds for lobular inflammation and 3.1-fold odds for ballooning degeneration. Every 5-unit increase in BMI was associated with 2.2-fold odds for macrovesicular steatosis, 1.8-fold odds for lobular inflammation and 1.6-fold odds for ballooning degeneration. G allele was associated with 2.1-fold odds for macrovesicular steatosis, 1.8-fold odds for lobular inflammation and 1.1-fold odds for ballooning degeneration.<SEP>Fibrosis<SEP>The age-adjusted prevalence of hepatic fibrosis of any stage was 42% in the alcoholic cases and 30% in the nonalcoholic cases, while the age-adjusted prevalence of advanced fibrosis was 18% and 6%, respectively. However, the rs738409 CC genotype was not associated with hepatic fibrosis (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.76\u20132.0). The effect of alcohol and BMI was also similar across rs738409 genotypes.<SEP>The interaction term alcohol\u00d7BMI was statistically significant (P = 0.036). Every 5-unit increase in BMI was associated with 2.2 times the odds (95% CI, 1.5\u20132.5) of fibrosis in the nonalcohol group, but was not associated with increased fibrosis in the alcohol group (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.66\u20133.1). Figure 3 outlines the age-standardized prevalence of hepatic fibrosis by alcohol and obesity. The rs738409 GC\/GG genotype was not associated with hepatic fibrosis (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.76\u20132.0) owing to a higher prevalence of stage 1 and 2 fibrosis in CC genotype and stage 3 and 4 fibrosis in GC\/GG genotype (Figure 4), which violated the proportional odds assumption of the ordinal regression model (cumulative model test, P = 0.0004). When compared across stage 0\u20132 vs. 3\u20134 fibrosis, the rs738409 GC\/GG genotype was associated with 3.2 times the odds (95% CI, 1.4\u20137.3).<SEP>Other liver disease histologies<SEP>There were 12 cases with grade 1 portal inflammation without steatosis. Compared with normal liver, isolated portal inflammation was associated with rs738409 GC\/GG genotype (P = 0.04), but not BMI or alcohol. These 12 cases were consistent with viral hepatitis. One patient had grade 2 lobular inflammation without steatosis. Forty-four patients had fibrosis without steatosis (stage 1a\/b = 14; stage 1c = 12; stage 2 = 10; stage 3 = 5; and stage 4 = 3). Isolated fibrosis was not associated with rs738409 genotype, BMI, or alcohol. There were 19 cases of stage 1c portal-only fibrosis: 7 were associated with steatosis (grade 1 = 4; grade 2 = 2; and grade 3 = 1) and 12 were not. Stage 1c fibrosis was associated with BMI (P = 0.01), but not genotype or alcohol."]
