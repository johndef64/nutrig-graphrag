General and Demographic Characteristics of the Participants According to Gender and Obesity\n\nThe men were older than the women, while the obese women were older than the nonobese women (p < 0.001). Obese women were shorter than nonobese women, but there was no height difference linked to obesity in men (p < 0.001). The average BMIs of the nonobese and obese groups were approximately 22.5 and 27.1 kg/m2, respectively, in both gender groups (Table 1). The waist circumferences were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, but men in the obese and nonobese groups had greater waist circumferences than women in the corresponding weight groups. Interestingly, the skeletal muscle and fat mass were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group for both genders (p < 0.05; Table 1). On the other hand, the adjusted ORs were much higher for waist circumferences (OR = 18.3 and 95% CI: 16.5–20.3) and fat mass (OR = 20.71 and 95% CI = 17.83–24.16) for obesity risk than the skeletal muscle mass. The initial menstrual age was younger in the obese group than in the nonobese group, while there was no significant difference in menopausal age in the obese and nonobese groups (Table 1).\n\nThe incidence of metabolic syndrome was much higher in the obese groups in both genders, and the risk of metabolic syndrome increased 5.86-fold in the obese group (p < 0.001; Table 1). The components of metabolic syndrome were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders. Serum total cholesterol and LDL concentrations were much higher in women than men, but the serum triglyceride concentrations were higher in men than women (Table 1). The serum HDL concentrations were higher in women than men. In the combined lipid profiles, women had as many lipid disturbances as men. Furthermore, obese women exhibited higher serum hs-CRP concentrations than nonobese women, but this was not observed in men (Table 1). Blood pressure, including systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), was higher in the obese group than the nonobese group, and men showed higher blood pressure than women. Women had much higher eGFR than men, and eGFR was lower in the obese group than in the nonobese group. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations were higher in the obese groups than the nonobese groups in both genders. Obesity increased the odds ratio for higher AST and ALT concentrations by 2.0 and 2.7-fold, respectively (Table 1). \n\n3.2. Lifestyle Characteristics of the Participants According to Genders and Obesity\n\nThe daily energy intake based on the estimated energy intake was higher in the obese groups than the nonobese group in both genders, and it increased the obesity risk by 1.24-fold. The protein intake also elevated the obesity risk (p < 0.05; Table 2) based on the daily energy intake. In women, the carbohydrate intake was higher in the obesity group than the nonobese group, and the association of the carbohydrate intake with the obesity risk was marginally significant (p = 0.0508). Fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and cholesterol intake, were not associated with the obesity risk (Table 2). Their intake was slightly higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in men, but their intakes showed an opposite tendency in women. DII was similar in the obese and nonobese groups, but DII was higher in men than women (Table 2). Interestingly, the fried-food intake was higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, but the intake of sugar-containing foods was higher in the nonobese groups than the obese group in women, but not men (Table 2). Obese men had a higher intake of a Korean balanced diet and Western-style diet than the nonobese men, while there was no difference in the plant-based diet and rice-based diet intake in obese and nonobese men (Table 2). Obese women had a lower plant-based diet and a higher Korean balanced diet than nonobese women. There was no significant association of dietary patterns with obesity risk (Table 2).\n\nAlcohol intake was much higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, particularly in men (Table 2). Alcohol intake was positively associated with the obesity risk. Fewer current smokers belonged to the obese group than the nonobese group in men but not women (Table 2). Regular exercise lowered the incidence of obesity in women but not men. Regular exercise was inversely associated with the risk of obesity (Table 2). \n\n3.3. Genetic Variants Related to the Obesity Risk and the Best Model with SNP-SNP Interaction\n\nTen genes with SNPs that affect the obesity risk were chosen to examine genetic variant−genetic variant interactions in the GMDR in the urban hospital-based cohort (Table 3). The selected genetic variants involved in the obesity risk were SEC16 Homolog B (SEC16B, endoplasmic reticulum export factor) rs543874, DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C27 (DNAJC27)_rs713586, CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1)_rs9356744, transcription factor AP-2 Beta (TFAP2B)_rs2206277, BDNF_rs6265, myosin light chain-2 (MYL2)_rs3782889, olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4)_rs9568856, FTO_rs1421085, MC4R_rs6567160, and GIPR_rs1444988703 (Table 3). These genes were strongly connected, and FTO and MC4R acted as hub genes that affect the risk of obesity. All of the genes were involved in either energy intake or energy expenditure by modulating transcription factors. These SNPs satisfied the MAF (>0.01) and HWE (p > 0.05) criteria (Table 2). Some SNPs had an inverse association with obesity risk, while the other SNPs were positively associated with the obesity risk. The p values of most selected SNPs were higher than 5×10−7, but rs3782889_MYL2 and rs9356744_CDKAL1 did not meet the statistical criteria (Table 3). These SNPs had similar associations with the obesity risk, and the statistical significance was higher in the Ansan/Ansung cohort (Table 3), but they were not ultimately included in the best model.\n\nAmong the genetic variants selected, the models including 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 SNPs met the criteria of TREB and CVC for the best model to explain the SNP−SNP interactions that contribute to obesity risk. The five models exhibited significant interactions among the genetic variants that influenced the obesity risk (Table 4). The 5-SNP model included SEC16B_rs543874, DNAJC27_rs713586, BDNF_rs6265, MC4R_rs6567160, and GIPR_rs1444988703. The genetic variants in model 5 plus CDKAL1_rs9356744 and OLFM4_rs9568856 (model 7) also exhibited significant interactions (Table 4). The models that added the remainder of the SNPs to model 7 also had significant interactions for obesity risk. After adjusting for covariates, the models included five, seven, eight, nine, and ten genetic variants that met the TRBA, TEBA, and CVC criteria, including gender, age, resident area, regular exercise, and smoking status. However, since all of these models have similar statistical significance; therefore model 5, which included the smallest number of variables, was selected.\n\nModel 5 resulted in participants having PRS scores ranging from 0–9 risk alleles. The results show that BMI showed an increasing trend with PRS, and the participants with PRS scores of 8 and 9 had a sharp increment in BMI (Figure 2A). Although there was a positive association between PRS and BMI, some severely obese and underweight participants were distributed among the top deciles of PRS (8 and 9) to the bottom decile (0). However, obese (25–30 kg/m2) and severely obese (>30 kg/m2) persons had much higher representations in the middle deciles (2–7) than normal (18.5–23 kg/m2 for men and 18.5–22 kg/m2 for women), overweight (23–25 kg/m2 for men and 22–25 kg/m2 for women), and underweight (Figure 2B). In the other stratification, participants were assigned to low PRS (0–3), medium PRS (4–5), and high PRS (≥6) (Figure 2C). The PRS stratification showed a similar pattern of the top, middle, and bottom deciles, but the percentage of overweight participants in the three PRS groups was not significantly different.\n\nThe high PRS of the 5-SNP model was positively associated with the obesity risk: by 1.626 (1.474–1.801) and 1.629 (1.475–1.798) times after adjusting for covariates 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 2D). The high PRS with seven SNPs also showed a positive association with the obesity risk, but the ORs of the 7-SNP model were slightly smaller than those in the 5-SNP model (Figure 2D).\n\nThe PRS was significantly associated with the BMI: 1.43-fold and 1.55-fold in men and women, respectively, after adjusting for the covariates (Table 5). On the other hand, PRS was not related to waist circumference and SMI after adjusting for the covariates, including BMI. Interestingly, the fat mass was positively associated with fat by 1.46-fold only in men but not women after adjusting for covariates, including the BMI (Table 5). In addition, PRS was not related to menarche and menopausal age in women after adjusting for the covariates. \n\n3.4. Interaction of PRS and Nutrient Intake in Obesity Risk\n\nInterestingly, initial menstruation age interacted with PRS for the obesity risk. In participants with an early menarche age, the BMI was higher than those with late menarche age. The impact of PRS was much higher in the participants with early menstruation than those with late menstruation (p = 0.027; Figure 3A). The adjusted ORs and 95% CI were 2.38 and 1.608–2.841 in the participants with early menstruation and 1.562 and 1.405–1.738 in those with late menstruation, respectively (Table 6).\n\nA plant-based diet intake showed an interaction with the PRS to influence the obesity risk (Table 6). In a low plant-based diet intake, the genetic impact was lower for BMI, whereas the participants with a high PRS had a higher BMI than those with a low PRS with a high plant-based dietary intake (Figure 3B). Adults with a high PRS were protected against the obesity risk in a high plant-based diet (Table 6). The nutrient intake and other dietary patterns did not show any interactions with the PRS to affect the obesity risk.\n\nFried-food intake exhibited an interaction with the PRS (Table 6). The high fried-food intake participants had a higher BMI, but the PRS impact was offset in the participants with a high fried-food intake (Figure 3C). Thus, fried-food intake should be avoided to protect against obesity, even though a high PRS did not significantly exacerbate the obesogenic effects of fried-food intake (p = 0.035)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nCharacteristics of study population.\n\nBaseline characteristics of participants according to the FTO rs1558902 genotype are presented in Table 1. The minor allele frequency (MAF; A allele) was 0.402 in the total population. The genotype frequencies were significantly different among the sexes and ethnicities. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, all variables such as weight, BMI, WC, body composition, and fat distribution had no association with genotype at baseline. Baseline characteristics were similar among participants in the four diet groups (Supplementary Table 1). Likewise, no associations between the FTO genotypes and these measures were observed in the white participants (data not shown).\n\nEffects of FTO rs1558902 genotype on weight and waist: overall and two-factorial analysis.\n\nAfter adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline BMI, and diet groups, no main effects of the FTO rs1558902 genotype on changes in weight or WC were found in any participants at 6 months and 2 years (data not shown). We next examined the genetic effects on changes in weight and WC following a two-factorial design: low versus high fat and low versus high protein. We found that the risk allele (A) was significantly associated with a 1.51-kg greater weight loss in the high-protein group (P = 0.010), but not in the low-protein group, by the end of intervention (2 years). The changes in weight and WC were less significant at 6 months (Table 2). In subgroups treated by different proportions of dietary fat, we did not find significant genetic effects on changes in weight and WC (all P > 0.05; Supplementary Table 2).Similarly, in the white participants, we found the risk allele was associated with a 1.38-kg greater weight loss in the high-protein group at 2 years (P = 0.028), but not in other subgroups (data not shown).\n\nThe FTO rs1558902 genotype and changes in body composition by diet intervention.\n\nConsistent with the observations of change in body weight, we found that the rs15589002 risk allele (A) was associated with greater loss of total fat, FFM, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat at 2 years in the high-protein group, but not in the low-protein group (Table 2). Tests for genotype-diet protein interaction were significant on changes in FFM and FM% (for interactions, P = 0.034 and 0.049, respectively) adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, carbohydrate, baseline BMI, and the baseline value of body composition (Fig. 1). At 6 months, we only observed gene by protein diet interaction on changes in FFM (P = 0.008 for interaction; Fig. 1). The risk allele carriers in the high-protein group had greater loss of FFM than noncarriers, but those in the low-protein group had less loss of FFM compared with noncarriers (Table 2).\n\nWe did not find significant genetic effect and interactions between the FTO variant and dietary fat intake on changes in body composition in total participants (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The results in the white participants were similar (data not shown).\n\nThe FTO rs1558902 genotype and changes in fat distribution by diet intervention.\n\nWe further analyzed body fat distribution measured by CT. At 2 years, we found significant interactions between the FTO rs1558902 genotype and protein diet intervention on changes in TAT, VAT, and SAT (for interactions, P = 0.001, 0.012, and 0.002, respectively; Fig. 2). The risk allele (A) was associated with greater loss of TAT and VAT in the high-protein group but with less loss of TAT and SAT in the low-protein group (Table 2). At 6 months, gene-protein interactions were observed on changes in TAT and SAT (for interactions, P = 0.026 and 0.050, respectively; Fig. 2), and the risk allele carriers in the high-protein group had greater loss of TAT and VAT than noncarriers, but those in the low-protein group had less loss of SAT than noncarriers (Table 2).\n\nWe did not find significant genetic effects and interactions on changes in fat distribution in subgroups treated by different dietary fat components (all P > 0.05; Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2).Similar results were found in the white participants (data not shown).\n\nThe trajectory of changes in body composition and fat distribution by FTO rs1558902 in response to protein diet.\n\nIn a secondary analysis, we used linear mixed models to assess the genotype by time effect over the 2-year trial in those treated by the four dietary compositions. We observed significant genotype-time interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat in response to the high-protein diet. When assigned to the high-protein diet, participants who carried the AA genotype had greater loss in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat than those without this genotype. No genotype-time interaction on changes in body composition was found in the low-protein group (Fig. 3).\n\nWe also observed significant genotype-time interactions on changes in fat distribution in response to the low- and high-protein diets. Participants with the AA genotype had greater decrease in fat distribution in response to the high-protein diet compared with those without this genotype. In contrast, participants with the AA genotype were associated with less loss in TAT and SAT in response to the low-protein diet (Fig. 4).\n\nWe found genotype-time interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat in response to the low-fat diet (Supplementary Fig. 3), but no genotype-time interactions on changes in fat distribution were found in response to the low- or high-fat diets (Supplementary Fig. 4).A similar trend was observed in the white population (data not shown)."

    "content": "Results\n\nAssociation between the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism and anthropometric variables\n\nGeneral characteristics of the study subjects are shown in Table 1. GP subjects had a mean age 41.2±13.8 y and BMI of 26.0±4.7 kg/m2 (prevalence of obesity was 17.7%). The mean age of OHP was slightly higher (46.3±14.7 y) with a very high mean BMI (41.8±8.4 kg/m2). The educational level of OHP was lower than that of the GP. In elderly HCR subjects mean BMI was 30.1±4.0 kg/m2, with a high prevalence of obesity (49.1%) and lower educational level than the GP.\n\nWe observed (Table 2) that the FTO SNP was strongly associated with greater weight, BMI and waist circumference in the GP. This association followed a co-dominant model, BMI increasing by +0.5 (SE: 0.2) units per risk-allele (P = 0.009). A greater prevalence of obesity was also observed when A-allele carriers were grouped and compared with TT subjects (P = 0.038). These results maintained statistical significant following adjustment for sex, age, smoking and diabetes. In OHP, the association of the FTO SNP with anthropometric measurements was recessive. No differences were observed between the TT and TA subjects, the presence of two A-alleles being necessary in order to observe higher differences in means. In HCR subjects no significant differences in means of weight, BMI and waist circumference depending on the FTO SNP were observed. Neither was any association with the prevalence of obesity found. The statistical significance of results did not change after multivariate adjustment for sex, age, smoking and diabetes. Further adjustment of these models for PA and education did not change the statistical significance of results.\n\nInteraction between the FTO SNP and education in determining BMI and obesity risk\n\nFirstly, we studied the interaction between educational level expressed in 3-categories and the FTO SNP in determining BMI in the GP (Fig. 1A). The interaction term between the FTO SNP and education did not reach the statistical significance (P = 0.152) when 3-categories of educational level were considered. Thus, in the stratified analysis by educational level, we observed that the association between the A-allele and higher BMI in the GP was present in individuals with primary (P = 0.029) and secondary studies (P = 0.028), but not in university level subjects (P = 0.786). Hence, we decided to group primary and secondary studies together and to create a variable with 2-categories: non-university and university studies. This variable presented a statistically significant interaction term with the FTO SNP (P for interaction 0.048) in determining BMI in the GP (Fig. 1B). In OHP, this interaction was also studied, but no AA individuals with university studies were found. OHP were analyzed jointly with the GP, introducing population origin as a covariate in the statistical model. Again, a statistically significant interaction term (P = 0.043) was obtained between the FTO SNP and educational level in determining BMI (Fig. 1C). In the stratified analysis, the FTO SNP was associated with higher BMI in non-university individuals (P < 0.001), but not in university level subjects (P = 0.760). In elderly subjects with HCR (Fig. 1D), no statistically significant interaction of education with the FTO SNP in determining BMI was detected (P for interaction 0.839). The statistical significance of the interactions terms did not change after additional adjustment of the corresponding models for PA. Moreover, we studied the interaction between the FTO SNP and PA on BMI (Supplementary Fig. S1) and did not observe any significant interaction term between PA levels (sedentary versus active) and the FTO SNP in determining BMI in the GP (P = 0.617). However, in HCR subjects, we found a statistically significant interaction term (P = 0.045) when we considered the first tertile of PA (sedentary) versus the others. The statistical significance of the interaction terms between education and the FTO SNP did not change after additional adjustment for the interaction between FTO and PA (not shown).\n\nIn terms of obesity, we found a clear inverse association between education and obesity risk in the GP (Table 3). Subjects with university education had a lower obesity risk (OR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.25–0.54) than did subjects with primary studies. Likewise, AA subjects had a higher obesity risk than TT homozygotes. No significant association was found for TA subjects in the whole population. On analyzing the interaction term between the FTO SNP and education, we found a statistically significant interaction (P for interaction: 0.020) in determining obesity in the GP. In the stratified analysis by educational level in the GP we observed that in individuals without university studies, then FTO SNP was associated with higher obesity risk both in TA (OR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.09–2.23) and in AA subjects (OR: 2.01; 95%CI: 1.27–3.26). However, in individuals with university studies, no significant associations between the FTO SNP and obesity risk were found, and even a change in the direction of the effect associated with the A-allele was detected. In the joint analysis of both the GP and OHP, we also observed a statistically significant interaction term between education and the FTO SNP in determining obesity risk (P for interaction = 0.023). No significant interaction was obtained in the HCR subjects (P = 0.957 for the interaction term between the FTO SNP and education). The statistical significance of these estimations did not change after additional adjustment for PA (not shown)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nOut of 3002 screened publications (Figure 1), 1075 and 107 publications were assessed during abstract and full text screening. Inter‐rater agreement was κ = 0.72 and κ = 0.76 for title and abstract screening, respectively. Overall, 66 eligible publications were identified including 35 publication from cohort studies and 31 from RCTs. Among the publications from cohort studies, 28 investigated G × D, six G × PA, and one combined G × D and G × PA interactions. Among the publications from RCTs, 26 investigated G × L, two G × PA, one combined G × PA and G × D, one combined G × PA and G × L interactions, and one G × D interactions.\n\n Characteristics of the cohort studies \n\nEight publications from cohort studies (Table 1) were published from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) or the Health Professionals Follow‐Up Study (HPFS), six from the Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDCS), five from European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)‐InterAct, three from the Shanghai Diabetes GWAS study, two each from EPIC‐Potsdam, the Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) and the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KOGES), and one each from several other cohort studies. In NHS and HPFS, the study sample was recruited from the health sector staff and included mainly European descendants. In DESIR, volunteers from health facilities were recruited and in all other studies participants from the general population. The sample size of the studies varied between 718 and 99 166, with a mean age of participants greater than 40 years in most studies. The follow‐up time ranged from four to 26 years, with more than 8 years in most studies. Many studies were conducted in populations of only or mainly European ethnicity. Asians were included in the Shanghai Diabetes study, KOGES, and the Korea Association Resource (KARE). \n\nCharacteristics of the RCTs\n\nFifteen publications of RCTs were published from the Finish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS), 14 from the American Diabetes Prevention Project (DPP), one from Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED), and one from a study in Italians from Asti. \n\nIn DPP (Table 2), 3234 participants with IGT and elevated fasting glucose were randomized into an intensive lifestyle‐intervention group and two standard lifestyle groups with administer of metformin or placebo. The lifestyle intervention included individual advices and behavior modification to reduce weight by lower fat and calorie intake and higher PA. In DPS, 522 participants with a high risk for T2D were randomized into a lifestyle‐intervention group or a usual care control group. The lifestyle‐intervention group was individually guided to reduce weight by increasing PA and following a recommended diet. In DPP and DPS, the lifestyle intervention resulted in weight reduction and lower T2D risk. \n\nIn PREDIMED, participants with high cardiovascular risk were randomized into three groups: two Mediterranean‐diet groups with extra‐virgin olive oil (1 L/week) or mixed nuts (30 g/day), and a control group with advice on a low‐fat diet. In the Italian study, 335 participants who were nondiabetic and dysmetabolic were randomized into a lifestyle group which received individualized recommendations by trained professionals to reduce metabolic abnormalities and a control group which received standard, unstructured information.\n\nDietary and PA exposure assessments\n\nThe investigated dietary exposure varied considerably across the publications (Figure 2, Table S6) and included individual food groups (whole grain, red meat, olive oil, dairy, and coffee), macronutrients (fiber, carbohydrate, fat, and protein), micronutrients (magnesium, iron, zinc, and vitamin A), alcohol, glycemic index and glycemic load, and dietary patterns. Dietary factors were assessed in most studies by validated food frequency questionnaire and in some by dietary history records or biomarker measurements. PA (Table S7) was assessed either by in‐person interviews or questionnaires. \n\nStudy quality and risk of bias\n\nThe NOS quality assessment resulted in high and average quality for 30 and five publications of cohort studies (Table S2), respectively. Reasons for point's deduction were mostly inclusion of selective group of volunteers and health stuffs and no statement for completeness of follow‐up.\n\nThe Cochrane risk of bias assessment resulted in low risk of bias for all RCT (Figures S1 and S2). With exception of the performance bias, all judged categories showed low risk of bias. Risk of performance bias was high in all RCT due to the nature of the lifestyle intervention complicating blinding of patient and personal.\n\nThe evaluation of methodological quality (Table S3) resulted in high quality for 26 and medium quality for nine cohort study publications. For the RCTs, 13, 17, and one publications were scored as high, medium, and low quality, respectively. Small sample sizes and missing information about Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium often reduced methodological quality.\n\nMain findings\n\nOf the 66 eligible publications, 19 cohort studies and nine RCT publications reported statistically significant G × E interaction (Figure 2, Tables 3, 4). In addition, some other publications observed significant T2D risk associations in some exposure strata but not in the respective other, although no statistically significant interactions were reported. Potential G × D interaction for genetic variants in the TCF7L2 gene were most frequently investigated, while findings of other genetic variants were often limited to one publication only. Furthermore, publications showed a considerable heterogeneity in investigated dietary factors.\n\nFindings for G × D interaction on incident T2D\n\nInteraction of fiber and whole grain with genetic variants\n\nG × D interactions (Figure 2, Table S6) of TCF7L2 variants have been the most widely studied so far. In particular, the TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 is of interest as it is considered to be strongly associated with T2D risk and known to modify the effect of incretins on insulin secretion. Some publications reported interaction of TCF7L2 variants with fiber and whole‐grain intake on T2D incidence (Figure 2, Table S6). Increased cereal fiber intake in the Stockholm Diabetes Prevention Program (SDPP) and fiber intake in MDCS were associated with lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs7903146 CC‐genotype. Contrary, persons with the rs7903146 risk T‐allele showed a slight trend for increased T2D risk with increasing cereal fiber intake in SDPP and with increasing fiber intake in MDCS. An interaction of whole grain with TCF7L2 rs7903146 was also reported by SDPP and EPIC‐Potsdam. In line with the fiber findings, higher whole‐grain intake was in both studies associated with lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs7903146 CC‐genotype, but not among persons with the risk T‐allele. The TCF7L2 variant rs4506565 also showed interaction with cereal fiber and whole‐grain intake in SDPP and the TCF7L2 variant rs12255372 with fiber intake in MDCS. Contrary, in EPIC‐InterAct and NHS, no interactions of fiber intake with rs7903146 or rs12255372 were observed. \n\nIn MDCS, fiber intake also showed interactions with the variant rs10923931 in the NOTCH2 (involved in WNT activity) and rs4457053 in the ZBED3 (involved in WNT signaling pathway) gene but without replication in another study. Several further variants were investigated in MDCS and in EPIC‐InterAct but none showed an interaction with fiber (Figure 2).\n\nInteraction of carbohydrates and fat with genetic variants\n\nInteraction of carbohydrates and total fat was reported (Figure 2, Table S6) by MDCS with IRS1 rs2943641 (known to increase insulin sensitivity) and with GIPR rs10423928 (known to decrease insulin secretion). However, the IRS1 rs2943641 findings have not been validated in any other study so far, and the GIPR rs10423928 interaction findings could not be replicated in EPIC‐InterAct (12). In NHS, TCF7L2 rs12255372 showed no interaction with carbohydrates, but with glycemic load. A replication of this finding in EPIC‐InterAct failed as well. \n\nPotential interaction of fat with genetic variants was also reported by DESIR but without external replication. In DESIR, a trend for interaction (P = .05) was observed between fat intake and the PPARγ (receptor for fatty acid storage) variants rs1801282 and rs3856806. Furthermore, H‐allele carriers of the FFAR4 variant rs116454156 (involved in Gαq signaling) had a fourfold higher T2D incidence in DESIR than RR‐allele carriers but with low fat intake only. In EPIC‐Potsdam, the CAV2 variant rs2270188 showed an interaction with total fat and saturated fatty acids but a replicate of the CAV2 findings in EPIC‐InterAct failed (12). In addition, no evidence was found in EPIC‐InterAct, NHS, and HPFS for interactions of T2D‐GRSs and IR‐GRS with fat and carbohydrates.\n\nInteraction of alcohol with genetic variants\n\nAn interaction of alcohol with the ADH1C *1/*2 variant (Figure 2, Table S6) was reported by NHS. The ADH1C*2‐allele, which is related to a slower rate of ethanol oxidation, attenuated the lower diabetes risk among alcohol drinking US women. In contrast, such an interaction was not observed among US men. In addition, a T2D gene risk score (GRS) in NHS and HPFS and two HECTD4 variants in KoGES showed no interaction with alcohol.\n\nInteractions of micronutrients with genetic variants\n\nFindings (Figure 2, Table S6) indicate that the association of heme iron with T2D incidence is modified by a GRS of nine T2D associated loci and genetic variants of HFE (homeostatic iron regulator), SLC40A1 (iron‐regulated transporter), and TMPRSS6 gene (transmembrane serine proteinase). In HPFS, US men with high heme iron intake and high adherence to a T2D‐GRS had a higher T2D risk compared with other exposure strata. In NHS, higher heme iron intake was associated with increased T2D risk among women with the haemochromatosis‐associated HFE variants rs1799945 (H63D) or rs1800562 (C282Y). A similar trend was also observed in EPIC‐InterAct for women with the HFE rs1799945 variant, but the corresponding interaction was not significant. Contrary, for men in EPIC‐InterAct, this interaction was significant. In EPIC‐InterAct, heme iron intake showed also interaction with the SLC40A1 rs744653 variant in men and with borderline significance (P = .046) for the TMPRSS6 variant rs855791 in the total sample. In NHS and HPFS, rs855791 showed no interaction. \n\nFor zinc intake, DPP reported an interaction with the SLC30A8 (zinc transporter) variants rs16889462, 8_118252314, and 8_118252435, but without a clear trend for an association with T2D incidence in exposure strata. Investigations of potential interaction of some genetic variants with magnesium intake or vitamin A resulted in nonsignificant findings (Figure 2).\n\nInteractions of individual food with genetic variants\n\nSeveral individual foods have been investigated for potential G × D interaction including red meat, processed meat, olive oil, dairy, and coffee (Figure 2, Table S6). Interactions of red and processed meat with a T2D‐GRS were observed in HPFS. High intake of red and processed meat increased the risk to develop T2D among men with a high GRS, but not among men with a low GRS. Olive oil showed a marginally nonsignificant interaction (P = .05) with the GIPR variant rs10423928 in EPIC‐InterAct.24 \n\nThe association of dairy products with T2D incidence may be modified by the genetic variant rs4988235 near the lactase persistence LCT gene. In a large Danish study, carriers with the lactase persistence LCT rs4988235 T‐allele had higher T2D risk compared with persons with the lactose nonpersistence CC‐genotype when they did not consume milk. A contrasting reduced risk was observed among milk consumers. Coffee intake is hypothesized to reduce T2D risk, and findings from EPIC‐InterAct and KARE indicate that there exist interactions of coffee with some genetic variants. In EPIC‐InterAct, a stronger T2D risk lowering effect with higher coffee intake has been observed for persons with the risk T‐allele of the TCF7L2 variant rs12255372. In KARE, only coffee consumers with the rs4402960 T‐allele (IGF2BP2), rs7754840 G‐allele (CDKAL1), and rs5215 CC‐genotype (KCNJ11) had a reduced combined prediabetes and T2D risk compared with nonconsumer. Besides these findings, several other genetic variants showed no interaction with coffee, olive oil, or dairy products (Figure 2).\n\nInteractions of dietary patterns with genetic variants\n\nEvidence suggests that dietary patterns that reflect Western diet and enhance T2D incidence and those that reflect Mediterranean diet lower T2D incidence. In HPFS (Figure 2, Table S6), a Western dietary pattern was associated to higher T2D risk only among persons with a high T2D‐GRS, but not among persons with a low T2D‐GRS. In PREDIMED, a borderline significant interaction (P = .052) between the CLOCK variant rs4580704 and the Mediterranean diet was observed indicating lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs4580704 G‐allele compared with persons with the CC‐genotype. In EPIC‐InterAct, a Mediterranean‐diet score showed no interaction with a T2D‐GRS. \n\nFindings for G × PA interactions on T2D incidence\n\nSeveral findings indicate that the protective effect of PA on T2D risk is modified by genetic variants (Tables 3 and S7). From the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, it was reported that the association of PA with lower T2D incidence was weaker among persons with high adherence to a T2D‐GRS compared with persons with a low adherence to the T2D‐GRS. In the Swedish Malmö preventive program, the minor HNF1B rs4430796 A‐allele weakened and possibly reversed the protective effect of higher PA on T2D incidence which was observed in persons with the GG‐genotype. In NHS, women with the IRS1 rs1522813 A‐allele and low levels of PA had a higher risk to develop T2D compared with women with the GG‐genotype, but not if they were physically active. \n\nIn DPS, reduced leisure‐time physical activity (LTPA) (Table 3, S8), controlled for weight and diet changes, was associated with higher T2D incidence among persons with the PPARγ rs1801282 Ala‐ and rs17036314 C‐alleles compared with persons with the ProPro‐ and GG‐genotypes. Contrary, an increase of LTPA resulted in lower T2D incidence among persons with the ADRA2B Glu12‐allele, with the ABCC8 rs3758947 GG‐genotype and with the nonrisk haplotype of the four SLC2A2 variants rs5393, rs5394, rs5400, and rs5404, whereas persons with the risk allele seem to be unresponsive to change in LTPA. Several further investigated genetic variants showed no interaction with PA or change in LTPA (Table 3).\n\nFindings for G × L interactions on incident T2D\n\nFindings of DPP and DPS indicate that interaction between weight loss interventions to reduce diabetes risk and genetic variants may modify the risk to develop T2D (Tables 4 and S9). In both studies, participants with the TCF7L2 rs12255372 risk TT‐genotype showed lower T2D incidence in the intervention group than in the control group. Similar findings were reported for persons with the rs7903146 risk T‐allele by DPP and the Asti study. However, the corresponding interaction tests were not significant. \n\nOther genetic variants have been investigated only in one RCT study populations, respectively. In DPP, the weight loss intervention was associated with a reduced T2D incidence among persons with the diabetogenic variant of ENPP1 rs1044498, and a trend for interaction was found for MC4R rs17066829. Reported interaction findings from DPS indicate that the weight loss intervention resulted in a lower T2D incidence among persons with the PPARγ rs1152003 CC‐genotype, the TNFα rs1800629 GG‐genotype, the ADRA2B Glu9‐allele, and the LIPC rs2070895 A‐allele compared with the reference genotypes. Both studies investigated also several further genetic variants, but of them none showed an indication for interaction with weight loss intervention (Table 4)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nStudy samples\n\nClinical characteristics of the study samples are reported in Table 1. The case group in set 1 had more women than the control group. The mean age at enrollment for the T2D-ESRD group was higher (P < 0.05), but the age of onset of T2D in the case subjects was >7 years earlier than the age of enrollment for control subjects. Mean BMI was not significantly different between T2D-ESRD case and nondiabetic control subjects (P = 0.19). Set 2 case subjects also included a higher percentage of women. Mean age at enrollment for the T2D group was higher (P < 0.05); the mean BMI for T2D case subjects was higher than for control subjects (P < 0.05). Overall, the samples have characteristics that reflect the general population of African Americans in the southeast. The mean (SD) African ancestry proportions in the 1,502 T2D-ESRD case subjects, 1,150 T2D case subjects, and 1,393 combined control subjects were 0.79 ± 0.10, 0.78 ± 0.10, and 0.78 ± 0.09, respectively, as estimated by the frequentist estimation of individual ancestry proportion program.\n\nAnalysis of individual index variants\n\nRisk allele frequencies and individual SNP association results are reported in Table 2. When the 2,652 T2D case subjects and 1,393 control subjects were combined, frequencies of risk alleles ranged from 8.64 to 99.97%. Notably, we observed an association of rs7903146 in TCF7L2 (OR 1.38 [95% CI 1.23–1.54], P = 1.25 × 10−8). In addition, rs10010131 in WFS1 (OR 1.13, P = 0.029), rs10946398 in CDKAL1 (OR 1.14, P = 0.014), and rs864745 in JAZF1 (OR 1.20, P = 2.30 × 10−3) were associated with directions of association consistent with prior reports in European-derived samples. SNP rs4607103 in ADAMTS9 was also associated (P = 2.40 × 10−3); however, the direction of association was opposite that reported in a European sample (OR 0.84 in this analysis). Results of an additional analysis adjusting for BMI were comparable (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nSNPs were evaluated in case groups (sets 1 and 2) and subsequently combined in a meta-analysis to determine if associations differed between the overall and individual analyses (Supplementary Table 2). The TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 was associated in sets 1 and 2. In set 1, rs4607103 in ADAMTS9 was associated; however, the effect was in the opposite direction of that reported in a European sample. In set 2, rs10946398 in CDKAL1 was associated, as was rs864745 in JAZF1. In the meta-analysis, results were consistent with the combined analysis (described above) (Table 2); rs10010131 in WFS1, rs10946398 in CDKAL1, rs864745 in JAZF1, and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 replicated association with risk, whereas rs4607103 in ADAMTS9 replicated association in the opposite direction of effect of that previously reported in a European sample.\n\nCumulative risk score\n\nUnweighted and weighted cumulative risk scores were evaluated in the overall cohort. Figure 1A and B show the percentage of T2D case and nondiabetic control subjects plotted by the cumulative risk score of each individual; values were significantly different when scores were determined by both unweighted and weighted methods (P < 0.005 for both analyses). Figure 1C and D show binned distributions of cumulative risk scores determined by unweighted and weighted methods in T2D case and nondiabetic control subjects. Figure 1C shows that the nondiabetic control group had higher percentages of individuals carrying lower-risk allele loads (<21); whereas the T2D groups generally had greater percentages of individuals carrying higher-risk allele loads. Figure 1D highlights the more pronounced distribution differences in risk allele bins between the two groups. Differences in binned distributions for both unweighted and weighted analyses were significant (P < 0.005).\n\nCumulative risk assessment\n\nThe OR and 95% CI for each of the nine bins assessed by the full logistic regression model and the model with adjustment for rs7903146 are represented in Fig. 2A (unweighted) and Fig. 2B (weighted); results are summarized in Supplementary Table 3. There was an increase in the OR with an increase in risk allele category. There was no evidence of departure from a linear trend in the association of the number of risk alleles and disease (P = 0.71). In a model in which data were reanalyzed, treating the risk allele categories as a continuous variable, there was evidence of an association between cumulative risk allele load and disease status in the unweighted and weighted analyses (unweighted OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.01–1.08], P = 0.011; weighted 1.06 [1.03–1.10], P = 8.10 × 10−5). In both types of analysis (i.e., nominal and ordinal categories for the count of risk alleles), association was no longer significant after adjusting for the number of TCF7L2 risk variant rs7903146: nominal analysis results (Supplementary Table 3 and Fig. 2A and B); ordinal analysis results (unweighted 1.02 [0.98–1.05], P = 0.33; weighted 1.02 [0.98–1.06], P = 0.40).\n\nWe found no evidence for interaction with age (P = 0.20), sex (P = 0.59), BMI (P = 0.47), or degree of African Ancestry (P = 0.74). Recall that only individuals with >0.50 proportions of African ancestry are included in these analyses."

    "content": "Results\n\nCharacteristics of the EpiDREAM cohort\n\nThe baseline clinical characteristics of participants are reported in Table 1. Of the 17 394 participants, 42.8%, 42.5% and 14.7% displayed normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance (IFG/IGT) or T2D, respectively. The ethnic distribution of individuals was significantly different in the NGT, IFG/IGT and T2D groups. There was a decreasing percentage of IFG/IGT in subjects of East Asian (66.9%), African (62.8%), European (61.0%), Native North American (55.8%), Latino American (55.5%) and South Asian (43.5%) ancestry (Supplementary Table 3). There was a decreasing percentage of T2D in subjects of East Asian (22.7%), African (18.0%), South Asian (16.1%), European (14.4%), Latino American (12.9%) and Native North American (11.8%) ancestry (Supplementary Table 3). Overall, IFG/IGT and T2D subjects were on average 5.5–6.5 years older than the NGT subjects. The percentage of females was higher across all glycemic statuses (60.9%), but males were more likely to be IFG/IGT or T2D in comparison to NGT counterparts (Table 1).\n\nEffect of baseline glycemic status on BMI level and BMI change\n\nIFG/IGT and T2D status were positively associated with BMI at baseline when compared with the NGT group (IFG/IGT: β = 0.34 ± 0.02, P = 1.35 × 10−98; T2D: β = 0.44 ± 0.02, P = 5.25 × 10−80; Table 2). There was an association between IFG/IGT status at baseline and lower BMI change during the 3.3 year follow-up in comparison with NGT subjects (IFG/IGT: β = −0.13 ± 0.03, P = 3.65 × 10−7). A significant negative association between T2D status at baseline and BMI change was also observed in comparison with NGT subjects (β = −0.34 ± 0.04, P = 1.06 × 10−19; Table 2). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and two-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) at baseline were positively associated with BMI at baseline (FPG: β = 0.19 ± 0.01, P = 1.80 × 10−145; 2hPG: β = 0.20 ± 0.01, P = 4.26 × 10−159; Table 2) and were negatively associated with BMI change during the follow-up period (FPG: β = −0.09 ± 0.01, P = 8.47 × 10−14 and 2hPG: β = −0.10 ± 0.01, P = 1.28 × 10−19; Table 2).\n\nEffect of glycemic status transition on BMI level and BMI change\n\nThe transition from NGT to IFG/IGT was positively associated with BMI at baseline (β = 0.19 ± 0.04, P = 2.60 × 10−7; Table 3) and BMI change (β = 0.19 ± 0.04, P = 2.93 × 10−6). Compared to stable NGT, converting from NGT to T2D showed a positive association with BMI at baseline (β = 0.36 ± 0.08, P = 4.35 × 10−6) and BMI change (β = 0.38 ± 0.09, P = 2.25 × 10−5), with two fold higher baseline and delta beta values compared to that observed in IFG/IGT converters. Similarly, the transition from IFG/IGT to T2D was positively associated with BMI at baseline (β = 0.20 ± 0.03, P = 6.28 × 10−11), in comparison to stable IFG/IGT over the study period. However, this association was not significant for BMI change (β = 0.06 ± 0.04, P = 8.28 × 10−2). The change in FPG levels was significantly associated with a positive increase in BMI change (β = 0.16 ± 0.01, P = 1.1 × 10−52), but was not associated with baseline BMI (β = −0.01 ± 0.01, P = 0.52). An association between change in 2hPG levels, with BMI at baseline (β = −0.03 ± 0.01, P = 1.6 ×10−3) as well as with BMI change (β = 0.17 ± 0.01, P = 2.4 × 10−45; Table 3) was also observed.\n\nMain association and interaction between obesity predisposing SNPs, glycemic status on BMI level and BMI change\n\nAssociations between the 23 obesity SNPs, the genotype risk score (GRS) and BMI at baseline, and BMI change are reported in Table 4. Three of 23 SNPs reached a significant association with BMI at baseline with a direction of effect consistent with published GWAS data: rs9939609 in FTO, rs2984618 in TAL1, and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 (0.04 ≤ β ≤ 0.08; 1.4 × 10−14 ≤ P ≤ 1.8 × 10−5; Table 4). The GRS was also significantly associated with an increased BMI at baseline (β = 0.018 ± 0.002) per additional risk allele, P = 6.4 × 10−14, Table 4). The 23 SNPs and the GRS were not significantly associated with BMI change (Table 4).\n\nInteractions between obesity SNPs/GRS and traits related to glycemic status on BMI at baseline and BMI change are reported in Table 4. There was only one significant interaction between the rs1011527 SNP in LEPR and FPG on baseline BMI (P = 3.9 × 10−7). However, no significant main effect was observed for the rs1011527 SNP in LEPR on BMI with (β = −0.02 ± 0.02; P = 0.22) or without (β = −0.01 ± 0.02; P = 0.72) the interaction term in the model. Interactions between obesity SNPs, GRS and traits related to glycemic status transition on BMI at baseline and BMI change are reported in Table 5. Overall, there was no simultaneous significant main effect and interaction between glycemic status traits or transition and obesity SNPs or GRS, in relation to BMI level and BMI change."

    "content": "Results\n\nStudy Population\n\nThe study population had a male predominance (M:F ratio 2:1) that was slightly higher than expected, but it was otherwise representative of the ALL population seen at Texas Children's Hospital (Table I). Study participants were diagnosed between 1987 and 2001 and treated on various protocols, primarily Pediatric Oncology Group protocols (including POG 9005, POG 9006, POG 9405, POG 9605, POG 8698, and POG 8699). Early MTX-related neurotoxicity occurred in 7 patients (9.7%). Impairment on the DIVERGT battery was observed in 44.3% of the study population. Mean neurocognitive test scores in the overall population demonstrated mild deficits on PEGDH (p=0.02), PEGNDH (p<0.001) and CFL (p<0.001), when compared to the expected means of 100 (Table II). All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nGenotype and Impairment on the DIVERGT Battery\n\nImpairment on the battery was related to two polymorphisms: MTHFR 1298A>C (p=0.03) and MS 2756A>G (p=0.05). Survivors with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes had a 3.0-fold increased risk of impairment (95% CI 1.1-8.1), compared to those with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype. Similarly, those with the MS 2756 AA genotype were 3.8 times as likely to meet criteria for impairment on the battery as those with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes. MTHFR 677C>T, SHMT 1520C>T, MTRR 66A>G, and TSER polymorphisms were not significantly related to general impairment on the DIVERGT battery.\n\nGenotype and Individual Child Performance Measures\n\nSeveral genotypes were related to performance on TMTA (focused attention, processing speed) and TMTB (shifting attention, processing speed), as shown in Table III. Survivors with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes performed on average 7 points lower on TMTA (p=0.11) and 13 points lower on TMTB (p=0.001), compared to those with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype. Survivors with the MS 2756AA genotype scored on average 12.2 points lower on TMTA (p=0.01) and 5.3 points lower on TMTB (p=0.23), compared to survivors with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes. Finally, survivors with TSER 2R/3R and 3R/3R genotypes scored on average 10 points lower on TMTA (p=0.07) and 11.4 points lower on TMTB (p=0.03) than those with the TSER 2R/2R genotype. MTHFR 677C>T, SHMT 1420C>T, and MTRR 66A>G polymorphisms were not associated with performance on TMTA or TMTB. Complete analyses by genotypes for all six performance measures can be found in Supplemental Table I.\n\nThe remaining neurocognitive tests assessed fine motor skills (PEGDH and PEGNDH), working memory (DIG), and executive function (CFL). For survivors with the MS 2756AA genotype, the mean PEGNDH score was 11.7 points lower than that of individuals with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes (p=0.02). Additionally, survivors with the MTRR 66AA genotype scored on average 10.7 points lower on PEGNDH than those with the MTRR 66AG/GG genotypes (p=0.05). Survivors with the MTRR 66AA genotype also scored 10.5 points lower on average on CFL, compared with survivors with the MTRR 66AG/GG genotypes (p=0.01). Performance on the PEGDH and DIG measures were not associated with any genotype.\n\nWe did not observe an association between any child performance measure and any of the following covariates: sex, ethnicity/race, age at diagnosis, leukemia subtype, number of intrathecal MTX doses, and cumulative IV MTX exposure. The associations between genotype and child performance measures that are described above did not change after adjustment for these covariates. Of the 7 survivors with a history of early MTX-related neurotoxicity, 6 (85%) met criteria for long-term neurocognitive impairment on the DIVERGT battery. While early MTX-related neurotoxicity was predictive of long-term neurocognitive impairment (p=0.03), 25 of 63 survivors (40%) without early MTX-related neurotoxicity also went on to develop long-term neurocognitive impairment as determined by the DIVERGT battery. The 7 survivors with a history of early MTX-related neurotoxicity scored on average 15.3 points lower on TMTB than survivors without early neurotoxicity (p=0.03). Early MTX-related neurotoxicity was not predictive of impairment on TMTA, PEGDH, PEGNDH, DIG, or CFL.\n\nComplete genotyping results for all six polymorphisms were available for computation of the GRS in 59 patients. In this group, the GRS ranged from 0 to 9, with a mean of 6.2 and a median of 6. On average, survivors with a GRS ≥ 6 scored 9.5 points lower on TMTA (p=0.06) and 14.5 points lower on TMTB (p=0.002) than survivors with a GRS < 6 (Table III). No difference was observed in mean scores on PEGDH, PEGNDH, or DIG between the GRS groups. The association between the GRS and TMTB performance remained significant after adjustment for sex, age at diagnosis, intrathecal MTX exposure, and cumulative IV MTX exposure. We did not observe an association between GRS and impairment on the DIVERGT battery. However, all of the patients who demonstrated impaired performance on TMTA or TMTB (score <80) had GRS ≥ 6. No association was observed between GRS and impairment on PEGDH, PEGNDH, DIG, or CFL."

    "content": "Results\n\nAt baseline, the C risk allele at SLC30A8 rs13266634 was significantly associated with higher fasting proinsulin levels in the DPP cohort. This association was in an allele dose-dependent fashion after adjustment for baseline fasting insulin (p=0.002; Table 1) and remained statistically significant after further adjustment for fasting glucose (p=0.001; Table 1).\n\nAfter 1 year of randomised DPP intervention, fasting proinsulin levels were significantly decreased (p<0.001) in all active intervention groups compared with placebo, even after adjustment for 1 year fasting insulin, age, sex and ethnicity (Fig. 1). While intervention groups had significantly lower proinsulin levels than placebo group at 1 year, the lifestyle intervention group had the largest decrease and was significantly lower than the metformin (p<0.001) or troglitazone (p=0.002) groups. The metformin and troglitazone intervention groups had similar proinsulin levels at 1 year (p=0.86). There was no genotype × treatment interaction (p=0.78), suggesting that the dosage of SLC30A8 risk alleles did not modify the effectiveness of any treatment. As there were no significant genotype × treatment interactions, the four groups were also analysed together. At 1 year after DPP interventions, fasting proinsulin levels were no longer associated significantly with genotype at the SLC30A8 locus when adjusted for 1 year fasting insulin, age, sex and ethnicity (p=0.86; Table 1)."

    "content": "3. Results\n\n3.1. High carbohydrate diet increases and lipid emulsion attenuates the expression of PNPLA3 in mouse liver\n\nWe first analyzed how a lipogenic diet affects the expression of PNPLA3 in liver of intact mice. Compared to the group fed a stock diet (normal chow, NC), PNPLA3 mRNA was increased 7-fold in the liver of mice fed HC diet (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the inclusion of LE in the HC diet, either as HC-4% LE diet or as HC-13.5% LE diet, prevented the induction of PNPLA3 mRNA dose-dependently (Fig. 1A). Results from western blotting showed that similar changes were evident for PNPLA3 protein (Fig. 1B). Liver total TG content was significantly correlated with PNPLA3 mRNA levels in mice fed HC diet, either with or without LE (Fig. 1C).\n\n3.2. PNPLA3 is correlated with SREBP1c and ACC-1 in mouse liver\n\nTo determine if a similar pattern existed for other genes that are important in the lipogenic pathway, we also examined expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1c), a key transcriptional factor that regulates many genes involved in lipid metabolism, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-1), which is responsible for formation of malonyl-CoA in the process of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Both SREBP1c (Fig. 2A) and ACC-1 (Fig. 2B) showed a similar expression pattern to that of PNPLA3. We observed a correlation between PNPLA3 mRNA and SREBP1c mRNA (Fig. 2C; R2 =0.62; P<0.0001) and ACC-1 mRNA (Fig. 2D; R2 =0.84; P<0.0001). SREBP1c mRNA was also correlated with ACC-1 mRNA (Fig. 2E; R2 =0.85; P<0.0001). By contrast, PNPLA2 (ATGL), which can break down TG, did not differ among diets (Supplementary Fig. 1A). We also measured PNPLA3 gene expression in mouse epididymal tissue. PNPLA3 was not different among diet groups in this tissue (Supplementary Fig. 1B), although, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1C, PNPLA3 expression is highly expressed in murine adipose tissue.\n\n3.3. Hepatic PNPLA3 expression is not elevated in the liver of mice fed HF diet but is suppressed by exercise\n\nNext, we studied how high-fat feeding and physical activity may affect the expression of PNPLA3. In study 2, mice fed HF diet developed fatty liver indicated by the increased level of hepatic TG (Fig. 3A). This increase was attenuated by exercise (Fig. 3A). PNPLA3 expression was not elevated in mice with HF-induced fatty liver, compared to mice fed LF diet (Fig. 3B). Strikingly, voluntary exercise reduced PNPLA3 mRNA levels by 10-fold compared to the LF and HF diet groups (Fig. 3B). The mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Fig. 3C) and SREPB1c (Fig. 3D) did not differ between LF and HF diet groups. By contrast, ACC-1 was lower in the HF compared to the LF diet group (Fig. 3E). Moreover, exercise significantly suppressed both SREBP1c and ACC-1 gene expression (Fig. 3D and E).\n\n3.4. PNPLA3 gene expression was regulated by glucose in HepG2 cells\n\nWe investigated PNPLA3 and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) gene expression in HepG2 cells exposed to “depletion-re-feeding conditions” in which cells were cycled between no glucose (depletion), low, and high glucose media. PNPLA3 gene expression was reduced after 8 h of depletion (P < 0.05), while the level returned to base line 8 h after high glucose refeeding (Fig. 4A). After this, reduction in glucose resulted in a moderate reduction in expression, while high glucose for 8 to 24 h increased the level of expression, which, subsequently, was again completely abrogated after 16 h of starvation. ChREBP exhibited a similar pattern of expression to that of PNPLA3 (Fig. 4B), and correlation analysis showed that PNPLA3 mRNA levels were highly significantly correlated with ChREBP mRNA levels (Fig. 4C).\n\n3.5. PNPLA3 gene expression varies in response to glycolytic intermediates in HepG2 cells\n\nA series of experiments were conducted to determine whether metabolism of glucose was essential for induction of PNPLA3, and whether a specific glycolytic intermediate could be responsible for regulating PNPLA3 expression. These results showed that treatment with the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, did not induce PNPLA3 expression (Fig. 5A). Similarly, SREBP1c gene expression was induced two-fold by high glucose compared to low glucose, but suppressed by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (Fig 5B). Oil Red O staining showed that high glucose resulted in increased lipid accumulation, whereas 2-deoxy-D-glucose led to reduction of lipid content in cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B). Incubation with citrate, a Krebs cycle intermediate downstream of glucose metabolism, increased PNPLA3 levels, whereas pyruvate and acetate were ineffective (Fig. 5C). Expression patterns of FAS and ACC-1 were similar to that of PNPLA3 (Fig. 5D and E). In order to examine the specificity of PNPLA3 to citrate, cells were treated with the isomer isocitrate. The result showed that PNPLA3 was not regulated by isocitrate.\n\n3.6. PNPLA3 gene does not response to insulin and glucagon in HepG2 cells\n\nStudies conducted with 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human adipose tissue have shown that PNPLA3 gene expression is regulated by insulin. In addition, one study showed that insulin increased promoter activity of PNPLA3 gene expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Therefore, we examined whether hepatic PNPLA3 is regulated by insulin in HepG2 cells, which express the insulin receptor protein. Incubation of HepG2 cells with 10 nM insulin for 24 h did not increase PNPLA3 mRNA compare to control cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A). By contrast, the same treatment induced the expression of FAS, a known target of insulin action, by 2-fold (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). Taken together, these data suggest that hepatic PNPLA3 does not response to insulin stimulation in HepG2 human hepatocytes. Because our in vivo data showed that exercise suppressed PNPLA3 expression, we hypothesized that exercise may stimulate glucagon secretion, and thereby decrease PNPLA3 gene expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 100 nM glucagon in low (5.5 mM) glucose medium for 24 hours had no effect on PNPLA3 mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. 3C), whereas glucagon stimulated the expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), a known target of glucagon action (Supplementary Fig. 3D).\n\n3.7. PNPLA3 gene expression is reduced in HepG2 cells by several unsaturated fatty acids\n\nThe major fatty acid components of the LE we employed, Intralipid®, are linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA), and α-linolenic acid (ALA). Since the results of our studies demonstrated that Intralipid completely reversed the induction of PNPLA3 by HC-diet in mouse liver (Fig. 1), we investigated whether certain types of fatty acids affect PNPLA3 gene expression when added directly to HepG2 cells. Interestingly, treatment with either 400 μM OA (Fig. 6A) or LA (Fig. 6B) suppressed PNPLA3 gene expression in both low glucose and high glucose conditions. By contrast, ALA had no effect on PNPLA3 gene expression under either condition (Fig. 6C). We further explored the effects of two long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on PNPLA3 gene expression. Both EPA and DHA suppressed PNPLA3 gene expression under both low and high glucose conditions (Fig. 6D). Moreover, the combination of OA, LA, and ALA (ratio: 6:3:1) significantly suppressed gene expression of PNPLA3 (Fig. 6E), SREBP1c (Fig. 6F), and FAS (Fig. 6G) in both low glucose and high glucose conditions. All of these fatty acids resulted in lipid accumulation as measured by Oil Red O staining (Supplementary Fig. 2A and C).\n\n3.8. PNPLA3 knockdown did not prevent lipid accumulation but increased FAS expression\n\nSince PNPLA3 gene expression is regulated by nutritional signals and our data had implicated PNPLA3 as a lipogenic signal, we investigated whether the knockdown of PNPLA3 in HepG2 cells affects glucose or lipid metabolism. Cells transfected with scrambled siRNA as a non-targeting control were compared to cells transfected with PNPLA3-specific siRNA. Transfection with PNPLA3 siRNA decreased PNPLA3 mRNA and protein by ~65% and ~70%, respectively in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7A, B and C). However, Oil Red O staining showed no difference between cells with knocked down PNPLA3 and controls under either low or high glucose conditions (Fig. 7E). PNPLA3 knockdown also had no effect on lipid content when cells were incubated with exogenous fatty acid (OA) (Fig. 7E). Interestingly, we found that FAS mRNA was increased approximately 2 fold in PNPLA3 siRNA-treated cells compared to control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 7D). By contrast, knockdown of FAS using a strategy similar to that used for PNPLA3 had no effect on the level of PNPLA3 expression (data not shown)."

    "content": "Results\n\nTranscriptomic changes in the hippocampus of adult male rats following PNS\n\nOur first aim was to identify gene expression changes in the hippocampus of male adult rats (at PND 62) that had been exposed to PNS. We analyzed the entire transcriptome and we found a significant modulation of 916 genes in the comparison with control animals (using 1.4 < FC < −1.4, q-value <0.05). We have visualized the most significant genes in a hierarchical clustering in Fig. 1, and listed the 916 significant genes in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nWe then performed a pathway analysis on the significantly modulated genes, in order to identify the main biological processes involved. We identified 49 biological processes that were altered by the PNS exposure, including some involved in neurodevelopment (Axonal Guidance Signaling, Protein Kinase A Signaling, Glutamate Receptor Signaling, Wnt/β-catenin Signaling, CREB Signaling in Neurons, Synaptic Long Term Depression, Synaptic Long Term Potentiation, Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling) and inflammation (IL-8 Signaling, STAT3 Pathway, CDK5 Signaling, IL-1 Signaling, IL-6 Signaling, BMP signaling pathway and TGF-β Signaling). All the significant pathways are summarized by the pie-chart detailing the relevant functional areas (Fig. 2a), while the entire list of significant pathways is presented in Supplementary Table 2. We conducted the subsequent target prioritization steps using the full list of 916 differentially regulated genes.\n\nMiRNome changes in the hippocampus of PNS rats, and combined analyses with transcriptomic changes\n\nWe subsequently investigated whether exposure to PNS causes changes in miRNAs levels, and whether the identified miRNAs could target transcripts identified in the transcriptomics analysis. After the selection of the species (Rattus Norvegicus), we identified a total number of 1218 miRNAs (including pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs); out of these, 68 miRNAs (47 of them were mature miRNAs) were significantly modulated (all with q-value <0.05) in animals exposed to prenatal stress, with sixty-five downregulated and only 3 up-regulated (see Table 1).\n\nAs both transcriptomic and miRNome analyses were conducted in the hippocampus of the same animals, we then performed a mRNA-miRNAs combining analysis that allows the identification of a panel of top-hit genes that were both modulated by PNS exposure and targeted by the miRNAs that were modulated by PNS (see Methods). These analyses identified 528 significant genes, presented in Supplementary Table 3. The specific pathways analysis shows that these were genes involved in neurodevelopment (Axonal Guidance, Protein Kinase-A Signaling, Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling, TGF-β Signaling) and inflammation (STAT3 Pathway, PTEN Signaling, ILK Signaling, IL-8 signaling); the full list of the 42 pathways is presented in Supplementary Table 4.\n\nBlood mRNA transcriptomics of early life trauma in humans\n\nComparing subjects with and without exposure to early life trauma (see Methods for sociodemographic and clinical information), we identified 250 genes that were differentially modulated (FC > 1.2, FDR q-value <0.05) (see Supplementary Table 5), involved in the modulation of 41 significant pathways. Of note, these were, again, pathways involved in neurodevelopment (Wnt/Ca + pathway, cAMP signaling, CREB signaling) and inflammation (eNOS signaling, chemokine signaling, B cell activation), similar to what we found in the PNS model. All the significant pathways are summarized by the pie-chart detailing the relevant functional areas in Fig. 2b, and listed in Supplementary Table 6.\n\nIntegrating data from PNS in animals and from early life trauma in humans\n\nIn the next step, we integrated the 528 genes obtained by combined mRNA/miRNA analyses in the hippocampus of rats exposed to PNS with the 250 genes significantly modulated in the blood of adults exposed to early life trauma. We identified 22 common genes that were present in both lists; according to the hypergeometric distribution test, the probability that these genes were not overlapping due to random probability was p = 1.8 × 10–8.\n\nFinally, we validated all of the 22 genes by Real–Time PCR, both in the hippocampus of animals and in the blood of adults exposed to childhood trauma. In line with the microarray results, 16 genes were modulated in the same direction both in the rat hippocampus and in the human blood, and 6 were modulated in the opposite direction. Specifically, 15 were up-regulated in both: Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M), AT-Rich Interaction Domain 5B (ARID5B), Arrestin Domain Containing 4 (ARRDC4), EPH Receptor A4 (EPHA4), F-Box Protein 32 (FBXO32), Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), Heat Shock Transcription Factor 2 (HSF2), Isochorismatase Domain Containing 1 (ISOC1), Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor Adapter Protein 1 (LDLRAP1), Leucine-rich repeat neuronal protein 3 (LRRN3), Myosin ID (MYO1D), Phosphatidylinositol-4-Phosphate 3-Kinase, Catalytic Subunit Type 2 Beta (PIK3C2B), Phosphatidic Acid Phosphatase Type 2A (PPAP2A), Sterile Alpha Motif Domain Containing 12 (SAMD12), and Serine Incorporator 5 (SERINC5); one was down-regulated in both: Transforming Growth Factor, Beta 1 (TGF-β1); one was up-regulated in rats and down-regulated in humans: Solute Carrier Family 24 (Sodium/Potassium/Calcium Exchanger) Member 3 (SLC24A3); and 5 were down-regulated in rats and up-regulated in humans: B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL2), B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 9 (BCL9), Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1 (LEF1), Lin-54 DREAM MuvB Core Complex Component (LIN54), and Post-GPI Attachment to Proteins 1 (PGAP1). These genes are presented in Supplementary Table 7, where we also present the FCs obtained from the microarray studies and the FCs from Real Time PCR analyses. For all the above-mentioned molecular and biochemical analyses, all data met the assumptions of normal distribution and equality of variance.\n\nGene network analysis and selection of candidates for GxE interaction\n\nWe focused on the 16 genes (A2M, ARID5B, ARRDC4, EPHA4, FBXO32, FoxO1, HSF2, ISOC1, LDLRAP1, LRRN3, MYO1D, PIK3C2B, PPAP2A, SAMD12, SERINC5, and TGF-β1) that were modulated in the same direction both in animals and in humans, and we applied a gene network analysis to identify possible interactions among these genes. Indeed, our main theoretical framework was based on the notion that depression is a complex disorder, where multiple genes interact with each other as belonging to common or overlapping signaling systems. Therefore, also to minimize any chance findings, we decided a priori to select, for the subsequent GxE interaction analyses, only those genes that interacted with each other through physical interaction, co-expression or involvement in common pathways.\n\nUsing IPA Software, we observed only one cluster of interacting genes, represented by A2M, FoxO1 and TGF-β1 (Fig. 3). Using a gene enrichment/pathway analysis, we then confirmed that this cluster is involved in cytokines signaling, TGF- β1 signaling and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. As we found that A2M, FoxO1, and TGF-β1 form a single individual cluster of genes interacting with each other, we focused on these three genes for the subsequent GxE studies.\n\nGene X environment interaction studies\n\nFor our main analyses, we focused on all the SNPs located in these three genes and available in both the Grady Trauma Project and Helsinki Birth cohort (FoxO1, n = 132 SNPs; A2M, n = 91 SNPs; and TGF-β1, n = 14 SNPs), and we tested their interaction with emotional stress in childhood in predicting depressive symptoms in adulthood (BDI scores) for both cohorts (Table 2). Then, we assessed the combined effect over both cohorts and performed a meta-analysis (See Supplementary Table 8). The meta-analyses indicated that 6 SNPs, all located within the FoxO1 gene, were significantly associated with emotional stress in predicting depressive symptoms, and also survived multiple testing correction for GxE interactions, with the SNP rs17592371 showing the strongest significance (p = 0.003, Bonferroni correction). For all the 6 SNPs, p-values for heterogeneity of effects were not significant, indicating that fixed-effects meta-analysis was justified. The GxE interaction effect for the SNP rs17592371 in both cohorts is presented in Fig. 4, where we can see that individuals with “at risk” genotypes (CC) developed more depressive symptoms in the presence of early separation as compared to individuals with the “low risk” genotypes (CT and TT).\n\nWe also conducted additional, secondary analyses on these three genes, in the Grady Trauma Project sample, because it has a wider range of abuse phenotypes. Specifically, we tested the interaction between childhood sexual, physical or emotional abuse, and depressive symptoms in adulthood (BDI scores). Within FoxO1, 6 SNPs showed significant GxE interactions with sexual abuse, 40 SNPs with physical abuse and 40 SNPS with emotional abuse (although with a large overlap between SNPs); within A2M, 7 SNPs showed significant GxE interactions with emotional abuse; and within TGF-β1, 4 SNPs showed significant GxE interactions with sexual abuse and 1 SNP with emotional abuse (See Supplementary Table 9).\n\nFoxO1 is activated in hippocampal progenitor stem cells following cortisol exposure, and it mediates the negative effect of stress on neurogenesis\n\nAs FoxO1 was up-regulated both in the hippocampus of animals exposed to PNS and in the blood of subjects exposed to childhood trauma, and it was also the most significant gene from our GxE analyses across the two clinical cohorts, we decided to test the functional relevance of this gene. Specifically, we wanted to test: 1) whether the stress-induced FoxO1 upregulation could be replicated in vitro upon treatment with the human stress hormone, cortisol, using our established model of ‘depression in a dish’, the immortalized, multipotent human fetal hippocampal progenitor cell line (HPC0A07/03C); and 2) whether FoxO1 is involved in the cortisol-induced reduction of neuronal proliferation that we had previously described in this model.\n\nConsistent with our hypothesis, FoxO1 mRNA levels were significantly increased following 24 h of treatment with 100 μM cortisol (FC = + 3.9, p < 0.0001, Fig. 5a). Moreover, the cell-permeable inhibitor of FoxO1, AS1842856 (100 nM), was able to completely inhibit the cortisol-induced upregulation of FoxO1 (Fig. 5a) and the cortisol-induced reduction in neuronal proliferation (BrdU + cells; one-way ANOVA, p = 0.01 versus cortisol, Fig. 5b, c). AS1842856 alone did not exert any effects on proliferation (p = 0.9), indicating that FoxO1 mediates the effect of stress, but it is not active under baseline conditions.\n\nFinally, in order to investigate the molecular pathways by which FoxO1 signaling regulates the effects of stress on neuronal proliferation, we measured also the mRNA levels of a stress- and cortisol-induced gene, the Serum Glucocorticoid Kinase 1 (SGK-1), again following cortisol with or without AS1842856. SGK1 is a stress responsive gene that mediates some of the glucocorticoid effects on brain function, including the negative effects of cortisol on neurogenesis, and we found that SGK1 is elevated in both the hippocampus of stressed rats and in the blood of depressed patients. We found that 24 h of cortisol (100 uM) treatment up-regulates SGK1 mRNA levels (FC = + 3.7, p < 0.0001, Fig. 5a), replicating again our previous findings, and that AS1842856 was able to counteract such changes (Fig. 5a)."

    "content": "Results\n\nThrough December 2018, 359 people were referred for suspected or confirmed GCK-MODY, with 217 probands testing positive for a GCK variant either by Sanger sequencing or MODY gene panel. Of these, 72% were tested either on a research or clinical basis through the University of Chicago. Seventy-four probands have yet to be tested. Clinical information was available for a subset of probands with GCK variants (Table 1). Overall, clinical findings were similar to those with previously described pathogenic GCK variants in the. Sequence analysis identified 134 GCK variants in 217 families from the year 2008 to 2018. Of these, 107 variants were previously reported in the literature as causal. The remaining 27 variants, present in 28 probands, were to the best of our knowledge not previously described or reported (Table 2). These included 17 missense, 1 nonsense, 2 splice sites, 1 in-frame deletion, 1 in-frame duplication, and 5 insertions/deletions. After interpretation using the ACMG guidelines, 26% (7/27) of the novel GCK variants were found to be pathogenic, 56% (15/27) were likely pathogenic and 18% (5/27) were of uncertain significance. All novel variants except for Met210dup were identified in a single family. Seven variants (p.Lys13X, p.Leu185Pro, p.Val207Leu, p.Glu227Hisfs*47, p.Cys252Trp, p.Arg275Leu, and p.Ser281Pro) were previously reported by our group [, Supplementary Table] but are not included in the professional version of HGMD and are therefore further described in Table 2. Parental or extended family DNA was available for 10 out of 28 probands and co-segregation with the diabetes phenotype was established in those cases. Four of the five VUS (p.Ser127Pro, p.His141Pro, c.579+4delA, and p.Leu307Phe) were predicted to be damaging by in-silico tools. However, due to the lack of segregation data and/or phenotypic data on family members, these variants did not satisfy classification requirements for pathogenic or likely pathogenic. The p.Leu307Phe sequence change was identified in one proband with no family history of diabetes. Targeted sequencing of the parents’ DNA did not detect this sequence change and was thus presumed to be de novo in the proband. Paternity testing was not performed. The p.His317Gln moderately conserved sequence change was predicted to be tolerated by in-silico tools. This variant was detected in one proband and her mother, both of whom had stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia levels of 5.8-6.1mmol/l and 6-6.3mmol/l respectively. However, the proband reported an HbA1c level of 5.2% which is below the expected range for GCK-MODY."

Further mutual adjustment for other lipids subtypes did not alter the findings. HbA1c concentration was lower with an increasing rMED. After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, each of the concentrations of TAG, HDL-C and HbA1c remained significantly associated with the rMED. \n\nEach two-point increment in the rMED was significantly inversely associated with TAG (β − 0·005, 95 % CI − 0·007, − 0·002), LDL-C (β − 0·001, 95 % CI − 0·003, 0·000), apoB:apoA-1 ratio (β − 0·002, 95 % CI − 0·005, 0·000) and HbA1c (β − 0·001, 95 % CI − 0·002, 0·000), while it was directly associated with HDL-C (β 0·004, 95 % CI 0·002, 0·005) and apoA-1 (β 0·006, 95 % CI 0·002, 0·009) (β coefficients for log-transformed variables). The rMED was inversely associated with hypertriacylglycerolaemia (TAG>1·7 mmol/l), with OR 0·89, 95 % CI 0·81, 0·98; model 3. Sensitivity analyses did not alter the main findings.\n\nAssociation between glucokinase regulatory protein SNP and metabolic markers\n\nBaseline characteristics according to the GCKR rs780094 SNP showed that no significant differences were observed in relation to age, sex, BMI, WC, social class and physical activity. Significant differences were found for educational level and lipid medication (see online Supplementary Table S1). The AA genotype (frequency 15·6 %) was associated with 0·16 mmol/l higher TAG concentrations compared with GG individuals in adjusted analyses (Table 3). The AA genotype was also significantly positively associated with TC and apoB, but no significant differences were found for other lipid parameters (HDL-C and apoA-1) by genotype (Table 3). We found a tendency towards lower HbA1c concentration for the A allele, but this was not statistically significant. Application of the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons did not alter these findings. Both GA and AA genotypes v. GG genotype were associated with a greater risk of hypertriacylglycerolaemia in adjusted analyses (GA: OR 1·23, 95 % CI 1·15, 1·33; AA: OR 1·47, 95 % CI 1·33, 1·62). \n\nJoint results of genotype and Mediterranean diet adherence on metabolic markers\n\n Table 4 demonstrates the joint results of genotype and MD adherence on metabolic parameters. Participants with the highest risk (AA genotype and with the lowest rMED) had 12·5 % higher TAG concentrations (mean 1·68 (95 % CI 1·63, 1·73) mmol/l) than those who had the lowest risk (mean 1·47 (95 % CI 1·45, 1·50) mmol/l; GG genotype with the highest rMED; Table 4). Similar results were found for TC concentrations (2·3 % higher) and apoB (3·1 % higher), respectively (Table 4). For HbA1c, the converse was the case with those who were GG homozygous with the lowest rMED having 3·3 % higher HbA1c concentration (Table 4). However, the association of MD adherence and metabolic markers did not differ significantly by genotype, with no significant gene–diet interactions for lipids or for HbA1c (TAG, P= 0·770; TC, P= 0·761; apoB, P= 0·860; HbA1c, P= 0·481). These findings were unchanged with correction for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. \n\nSimilar results were found when we analysed the rs1260326 SNP (in high linkage disequilibrium with the rs780094 SNP, r 2 0·94) in a small sample (n 7273; data not shown). Furthermore, we performed a subgroup analysis stratified by age ( < 59·1 years old v. >59·1 years old; cut-off points selected by median), physical activity (inactive or moderately inactive v. active or moderately active) and smoking status (smoker v. non-smoker) for the outcomes analysed in order to examine whether in any of these strata, a significant gene–diet interaction was obtained. We did not find any interaction, though there were differences by genotype in TAG levels in both strata for each of those three factors (data not shown)."

    "content": "Results\n\nA total of 65 patients (47 males and 18 females) with a diagnosis of CHI were included in the study. Age at diagnosis ranged from immediately following birth to seven years old. Twenty-three patients (35.4%) were macrosomic and their mean birth weight was 3,690 g. Sixty-two patients were born at term. The CHI symptoms were first noted during the neonatal period in 29 patients (44.6%), during the infancy period (1-12 months) in 26 patients (40%) and during childhood (>12 months) in 10 patients (15.4%).\n\nOf the 65 patients, 13 were diazoxide-unresponsive, 40 patients were diazoxide-responsive and 12 received dietary treatment only. Patients were divided into two groups based on diazoxide responsiveness; Group 1, diazoxide-unresponsive and Group 2, responsive to diazoxide or dietary treatment. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of the patients in the two groups are presented in Table 1. Age at onset of CHI was significantly different between these two groups. The neonatal form comprised 92.3% of Group 1, but only 32.7% of Group 2. There was a significantly higher incidence of epilepsy in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p<0.05). The time between symptom manifestation and diagnosis ranged from one day to six years, and the duration was again significantly longer in Group 2. A patient (Case 61) in Group 2 was six years old and was initially misdiagnosed as having a seizure disorder before the hypoglycemia was detected.\n\nIn our study, ABCC8 mutations were identified in 16 children (25% of the cohort), and no KCNJ11 mutations were identified on KATP channel gene mutation analysis. Five patients with persistent HA had mutations in GLUD1 (Figure 1). No variants were found in the GCK gene. Fifteen different ABCC8 mutations were discovered, five mutations were compound heterozygous, 11 were heterozygous and none were homozygous (Table 2). Among the children who carried compound heterozygous mutations, diazoxide treatment was effective in three children. Treatment was not effective in one child and one child was regulated with diet.\n\nThe most common mutation was a deletion/insertion mutation c.3224-3226delACC ins CAGCCAGGAACTG (p.Thr1042GlnfsX75) found in five unrelated patients, which possibly represents a relatively common mutation in southern China. Five novel ABCC8 mutations (p.Phe5SerfsX72, p.Gln273ArgfsX85, p.Leu724del, p.Asp1447Gly and IVS 25-1G>T) were identified. Of the novel mutations, two were frameshift mutations, one was a deletion mutation, one was a missense mutation and one was a splice site mutation. In accordance with the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), two variants were perceived as “pathogenic” and three variants were predicted as “likely pathogenic”. A novel heterozygous variant in ABCC8 gene was identified in case 22. The patient has now been on therapy with diazoxide for more than one year at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day with normal growth and development. In one case (patient 59), two novel mutations were identified. This girl was macrosomic at birth. Hypoglycemia was first detected on day three after birth at a local hospital, and improved with frequent feedings. However, her parents did not monitor her blood glucose. She was admitted to our hospital at age 14 months for brief generalized convulsive periods. Laboratory tests revealed hypoglycemia (blood glucose: 2.5 mmol/L) HI (plasma insulin level: 5.9 µIU/mL) when she had an episode. Four hourly daytime feeds (solids and cow’s milk) and four hourly uncooked cornstarch (1.6 g/kg) could maintain the blood glucose above 3.5 mmol/L. During six months follow-up, there was no episodes of hypoglycemia. However, she had sustained hypoglycaemic brain injury with global developmental delay.\n\nIn this study, 16 parents underwent genetic analysis. Five patients (patients 1, 5, 10, 14 and 18) had paternally inherited monoallelic mutations. Of the five patients, three were diazoxide-unresponsive and two were diazoxide-responsive. In the three diazoxide-unresponsive patients (patients 1, 5 and 10), diffuse pancreatic disease was confirmed following surgery. One patient (patient 3) had two heterozygous mutations: one missense mutation c.314A>C (p.His105Pro) in exon 3, inherited from his father and a nonsense mutation c.2800C>T (p.Gln934X) in exon 23 inherited from his mother. He was diazoxide-unresponsive, which had been previously reported. The 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan indicated a focal lesion in the head of the pancreas, whereas the histology of the resected pancreas showed atypical form. The enlargement of pancreatic β-cell nuclei were distributed mainly in the head but included the body and tail of the pancreas. The abnormal active endocrine cells were not restricted to a focal lesion nor were they present throughout the entire pancreas.\n\nThe GLUD1 gene was detected in patients with hypoglycaemia, HI and mild HA. Three different heterozygous mutations in the GLUD1 gene were identified in five patients. The p.Arg322 His mutation was found in patients 54, 55 and 56. Patients 55 and 56 were sisters. The mutation was autosomal and dominantly inherited from their father, who was an asymptomatic carrier. The p.Ser498Leu mutation was found in patient 52 and the p.Asn463Asp mutation in patient 53. All mutations have been previously reported in patients with HI/HA. The serum ammonia concentration of this group of patients was 85-184 µmol/l. After a confirmation of the diagnosis of HI/HA syndrome due to a GLUD1 genetic defect, the patients were started on a low-protein diet (1.5 g/kg/day of natural protein intake). Three patients (patients 54, 55 and 56) were successfully managed by diet alone. They have had no further hypoglycaemic episodes. The other two patients were responsive to diazoxide treatment.\n\nOf 65 patients, 40 (61.5%) achieved long-term stable glycaemic control by diazoxide alone. Octreotide was administered to three children who were not responsive to diazoxide. Among these three patients, two were unresponsive to octreotide, and one patient discontinued this drug due to severe diarrhoea. Side effects of the diazoxide treatment were observed in 32 (80%) patients. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, severe gastrointestinal upset and poor appetite occurred in 69%. Six patients were fed through a nasogastric tube because of severe gastrointestinal reactions and their blood glucose levels were kept relatively stable. Different degrees of hypertrichosis occurred in 55% (22/40) of patients during clinical follow-up. In one case (patient 43), effective diazoxide therapy had to be stopped because of thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nPancreatectomy was performed in 10 patients who were unresponsive to drugs. Nine patients were treated with subtotal pancreatectomy, and one patient underwent pancreatectomy twice. In patient 3, a second resection of the pancreas was required because of sustained hypoglycaemia. Histological examination of the resected pancreatic tissue confirmed diffuse disease in nine patients and atypical form in one patient. One patient (patient 7) who underwent surgery at two months of age developed diabetes mellitus at five years of age and was treated with insulin. Case 8 developed diabetes mellitus immediately after surgery and required insulin treatment. Two cases still had mild hypoglycaemia after surgery; one (patient 4) was successfully managed with regular daytime and overnight feedings and the other (patient 9) was treated with diazoxide. Only one case had symptoms of malabsorption.\n\nDiazoxide treatment was stopped in 14 of patients (35%), between the ages of six months and four years, and no recurrence of hypoglycaemia was observed. Eight patients with subtotal resection were able to maintain normal blood glucose and HbA1c levels during the duration of follow-up. There were three diazoxide-unresponsive patients: one patient died of multiorgan failure and two patients abandoned the treatment and died of severe hypoglycemia after three to seven days at home."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nLevels of KBs across the categories of glucose tolerance.\n\nWe evaluated the association of AcAc and BHB in nondiabetic individuals and individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG) categories (Fig. 1). FPG ≤5.4 mmol/L and 2hPG ≤5.9 mmol/L were set as the reference categories. In the FPG category, AcAc levels decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in individuals with IFG by −2% (95% CI −4 to −0) and increased significantly (P < 0.01) in individuals with newly detected diabetes by +64% (+16 to +109), as compared with the reference category. BHB level decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in subjects with IFG by −5% (−7 to −3) and increased significantly (P < 0.01) in the diabetic range by +99% (+6 to +186). In the 2hPG category, AcAc level increased significantly (P < 0.01) in subjects with IGT by +21% (+13 to +28) as well as in newly diagnosed diabetes by +29% (+16 to +42), as compared with the reference category. BHB level increased nominally in IGT (P < 0.05) by +12% (+4 to +20) and in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (P < 0.01) by +52% (+23 to +79), as compared with the reference category. Fasting AcAc and BHB levels correlated significantly with FPG (r = −0.051, P = 1.9 × 10−6, and r = −0.065, P = 1.4 × 10−9, respectively) and 2hPG levels (r = 0.079, P = 1.4 × 10−13, and r = 0.042, P = 9.2 × 10−5, respectively).\n\nKBs and the risk of hyperglycemia and incident diabetes.\n\nFollow-up data of 4,335 participants were available from the ongoing prospective METSIM 5-year follow-up study. A total of 276 participants developed incident diabetes between the baseline and follow-up studies (follow-up of 5 years). Most of the participants who developed new diabetes on the basis of FPG level (62 of 70 participants) had their FPG in the range of 7.0–7.5 mmol/L, and most of the participants who developed new diabetes on the basis of 2hPG had their 2hPG level (52 of 80 participants) in the range of 11.1–12.0 mmol/L. AcAc and BHB levels adjusted for confounding factors known to increase the risk of diabetes (age, BMI, smoking, and physical activity) predicted an increase in glucose AUC evaluated as a continuous variable at follow-up (P = 2.3 × 10−4 and P = 5.7 × 10−6, respectively), and quite similar results were obtained for the comparison of the highest quartile of glucose AUC versus the three lowest quartiles of glucose AUC (P = 7.9 × 10−8 and P = 3.4 × 10−6, respectively) (Table 1). After further adjustment for baseline glucose AUC, the associations lost their statistical significance. The highest quartile of AcAc adjusted for age, BMI, smoking, and physical activity predicted conversion to type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.32 [95% CI 1.00–1.74], P = 0.047) (Table 2), and also after further adjustment for FPG (OR 1.41 [1.06–1.89], P = 0.019). Adjustment for 2hPG, instead of FPG, abolished statistical significance (P = 0.423). When analyzed in glucose tolerance categories, AcAc predicted incident diabetes in individuals with IFG (OR 1.49 [1.12–1.99], P = 0.007) after the adjustment for confounding factors.\n\nAdditional adjustment for insulin sensitivity strengthened the association of KBs with development of hyperglycemia and conversion to type 2 diabetes, whereas insulin secretion weakened/abolished these associations (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nLevels of KBs across the quintiles of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.\n\nTo study the mechanisms by which KBs could be linked to hyperglycemia, we investigated their association with insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. The levels of AcAc and BHB increased significantly (P < 0.01) in the highest quintile of Matsuda ISI up to 29 and 41%, respectively (Fig. 2). AcAc and BHB levels decreased significantly (P < 0.01) by −23 and −29%, respectively, in the highest quintile of insulin secretion (adjusted for insulin sensitivity) compared with the lowest quintile. In a multivariate linear regression model including insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion as independent variables, insulin sensitivity remained inversely associated with AcAc (P < 1.0 × 10−19) and BHB levels (P < 1.0 × 10−22).\n\nAssociation of risk SNPs for type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia with the levels of KBs.\n\nAssociations of 62 risk SNPs for type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia with KB levels are shown in Table 3. After correction for multiple testing (threshold of statistical significance, P < 4.0 × 10−4), the glucose-increasing C allele of rs780094 of GCKR showed a significant association with elevated levels of BHB (effect size +5.6% per the C allele, P = 3.7 × 10−6 after adjusting for age and BMI) and a nominally significant association with AcAc (+3.9%, P = 0.003). Additionally, there were nominally significant associations for SNPs of FADS1, ANK1, GIPR, HMGA2, and SLC2A2 with the levels of AcAc or BHB or both (Table 3).\n\nGene expression of genes involved in KB metabolism.\n\nCorrelations of adipose tissue mRNA expression with the most important genes regulating FFA oxidation, ketogenesis, and ketolysis are shown in Table 4. Pearson correlation of fasting FFAs with AcAc was 0.483 (P < 0.001) and with BHB was 0.443 (P < 0.001) in nondiabetic METSIM participants, and therefore genes regulating FFA metabolism were included in statistical analyses. Adipose tissue mRNA expression of the gene encoding CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) was positively correlated with glucose AUC and inversely with Matsuda ISI. This enzyme regulates the binding of carnitine to long-chain fatty acids, allowing them to be transported to the mitochondria for FFA oxidation. Expression of genes regulating ketogenesis, HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1, soluble) and HMGCS2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2, mitochondrial), did not correlate significantly with glucose AUC, insulin sensitivity, or insulin secretion. In contrast, significant correlations were found with adipose tissue mRNA expression levels of several genes associated with ketolysis with glucose metabolism parameters. Of these genes, ACAT1 expression had the most significant correlations with glucose AUC (r = −0.314, P = 6.1 × 10−6), Matsuda ISI (r = 0.479, P = 7.1 × 10−13), and insulin secretion (r = −0.444, P = 7.0 × 10−11). ACAT1 encodes acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1, an enzyme responsible for the last step in KB breakdown where two molecules of acetyl-CoA are generated from acetoacetyl-CoA (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, expression of other genes regulating ketolysis, BDH1 (BHB dehydrogenase, type 1), OXCT1 (3-oxoacid CoA transferase 1), and ACSS2 (acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2), was inversely correlated with glucose AUC and insulin secretion and positively correlated with Matsuda ISI. Adipose tissue mRNA expression of ketolysis genes did not correlate with the levels of KBs (all correlations <0.10, P = NS)."

    "content": "Results\n\nCardiometabolic SNPs in CRP GWAS\n\nFirst, we used QQ-plots to evaluate whether the p-values for the associations of the 283 cardiometabolic SNPs with serum CRP are distributed differently from what is expected under the null hypothesis in each trait group. As depicted in Fig. 1, the leftward deviation of the dotted lines in the QQ-plots shows that the 283 SNPs known for cardiometabolic phenotypes to have p-values smaller than expected under the null hypothesis in the CRP GWAS (p-value: 7.2×10-306).\n\nA total of 19 SNPs out of 283 independent cardiometabolic SNPs (6.7%) were associated with CRP after correction for multiple testing (p-value threshold 1.1×10-04). These 19 SNPs were located within or close to 12 different genes APOC1, HNF1A, GCKR, IL6R, PPP1R3B, HNF4A, PABPC4, BCL7B, FTO, TMEM18, PLTP and MC4R. Table 2 shows the SNPs with the lowest p-values in the 12 pleiotropic loci based on the CRP GWAS, i.e. the lowest p-value in that genomic locus. The eight SNPs in Table 2 with the lowest p-value were already known to be associated with CRP based on the recent CRP GWAS. The next four SNPs were not identified in the genome-wide association study of CRP. The first novel association was rs1558902 with a p-value of 2.2×10-6. This SNP is located in the first intron of the FTO gene on chromosome 16. The second novel signal was the SNP rs2867125 which is located on chromosome 2, near 46kb downstream of TMEM18. This SNP had a p-value of 5.0×10-6 in the CRP meta-analysis. The third association was with rs6065906 which is located on chromosome 20, near the PLTP and PCIF1 gene (p-value = 6.7×10-6). The last finding was rs571312 which is located 2 Mb upstream of the MC4R gene on chromosome 18 (p-value = 3.8×10-5).\n\nAmong the associated SNPs, we observed many SNPs with different directions of effect on the cardiometabolic phenotypes and CRP than one would expect based on the association of CRP and these phenotypes in observational data. As an example, the A-allele of the SNP rs4420638 in the APOC1 locus increases serum CRP levels. However, this allele is associated with a decrease in the level of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. We also observed such effects for the G-allele of the SNP rs1183910 in the HNF1A locus. This allele increases serum CRP levels and is associated with a decline in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.\n\nOut of the 12 pleiotropic loci, 6 loci had the same lead SNP in both the CRP and one or more of the cardiometabolic GWAS. In the other 6 loci the lead SNPs were different between the CRP GWAS and the cardiometabolic GWAS. However, in the majority of these loci the lead SNPs of the cardiometabolic GWAS were in high LD (r 2 > 0.8) with the lead SNP in the CRP GWAS. In the IL6R locus we observed the lowest LD between the top hit in the CRP GWAS and the CAD GWAS (r 2 = 0.52).\n\nCRP SNPs in cardiometabolic GWAS\n\nWe used the same QQ-plots as described previously to evaluate whether the association p-values for the 18 CRP SNPs are distributed differently from what is expected under the null hypothesis in the different cardiometabolic GWAS. As depicted by the leftward deviation of the dotted lines in the QQ-plots for CAD (p = 1.4×10-09), the cholesterol phenotypes (HDL-cholesterol, p = 6.4×10-69; LDL-cholesterol, p = 2.9×10-166; total cholesterol, p = 3.6×10-169 and triglycerides, p = 2.5×10-196) and the glycemic phenotypes (fasting glucose, p = 2.4×10-12 and fasting insulin 5.5×10-04), the p-values for the association between the 18 CRP SNPs and these phenotypes are significantly smaller than expected under the null hypothesis (Fig. 2). We did not observe such a significant deviation in the QQ-plots of BMI (p = 0.18) and SBP (p = 0.06).\n\nResults of the association of the 18 genome-wide significant associations with CRP-level are depicted in Fig. 3 (S1 and S2 tables). We observed 9 associations with one or more of the 10 cardiometabolic phenotypes close to or within the genes APOC1, HNF1A, IL6R, GCKR, IL1F10, PPP1R3B, HNF4A, PABPC and BCL7B (p-value < 1.1×10-4). Only 1 gene (IL1F10) was not identified in the previous analysis where we tested the association between the cardiometabolic SNPs and CRP. Among all 9 associations, we found three associations that are not reported in the GWAS for that specific phenotype. The first was rs1183910 with CAD (p-value 5.6×10-6). This SNP is located in the first intron of the HNF1A gene on chromosome 12. The second was rs6734238 with total cholesterol (p-value 1.16×10-5). This SNP is located on chromosome 2, nearby the IL1F10 gene and other interleukin 1 family genes. The third was rs4420638 with T2D (p-value 4.0x10-6) nearby the APOC1 gene on chromosome 19.\n\nComparable with the previous associations results, we observed many different direction of effects. For instance, the A-allele of the SNP rs4420638 in the APOC1 locus increases serum CRP levels and is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the G-allele of the SNP rs1183910 in the HNF1A locus increases serum CRP levels and is associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease.\n\nExploring the type of pleiotropy\n\nWe observed a total number of 13 genetic regions with pleiotropic effects on CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes: 12 regions identified in the first step testing the cardiometabolic SNPs with CRP and 1 additional region identified in the second step testing the associations of the CRP SNPs with the cardiometabolic phenotypes. Table 3 shows the unadjusted and adjusted associations between the 13 overlapping SNPs and CRP-level using individual level data from the WGHS. There was no significant association in the WGHS between the SNPs located near PLTP and MC4R and CRP after correction for multiple testing. The effect sizes of the genetic loci in or near the genes APOC1, HNF1A, IL6R, PPP1R3B, HNF4A and IL1F10 did not diminish substantially after adjustment for BMI, cholesterol levels and HbA1C suggesting biological pleiotropy. For BCL7B, FTO and TMEM18 the effect sizes decreased considerably implying mediated pleiotropy. The estimate of the association between rs1260326 (GCKR) and CRP decreased substantially after adjustment but was still strongly associated. We observed the same scenario for the association between rs4660293 (PABPC4) and CRP. When we added the phenotypes in a stepwise manner to the model, we observed for the mediated pleiotropic loci FTO and TMEM18 that the effect was mainly mediated through BMI (S3 Table). For BCL7B and PABPC4, lipids appeared to be the most important mediators. Fig. 4 shows graphically the biological and mediated pleiotropic effects.\n\nThe results for the associations between the pleiotropic SNPs and the associated cardiometabolic phenotypes are presented in S4 Table. Eight SNPs were not significantly associated with the cardiometabolic phenotype in the WGHS after adjustment for multiple testing. The majority of the estimates in- or decreased slightly after adjustment for CRP. However, the estimates between APOC1 and HbA1C, PABPC4 and triglycerides and BCL7B and HDL-cholesterol decreased considerably after the adjustment for CRP.\n\nPathway analysis\n\nThe results from the pathway analysis including all 13 pleiotropic genes are listed in the S5 Table. A total number of 13 canonical pathways were significantly enriched using an FDR of five percent. The top pathways included the FXR/RXR activation (p = 7.4×10-09), LXR/RXR activation (p = 4.6×10-05), Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) signaling (p = 7.6×10-05), hepatic cholestasis (p = 1.1×10-04) and acute phase response signaling (p = 1.3×10-04)."

The clinical characteristics including sex, age of both groups, and the number of aneurysms in the cases enrolled in our study are shown in Table 1. The mean age of all subjects was almost identical. There were more females among the cases (63.4%) than those in the controls (51.9%). The genotype and allele frequencies distribution of both polymorphisms in the control group met the requirements of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genotype and allele frequencies of the two SNPs and the combined genotypes frequencies of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro are summarized in Tables 2, 3 and 4. The CC genotype of miR-34b/c rs4938723 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IA, compared with the TT genotype (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.11–0.73, P = 0.006). However, no association between TP53 Arg72Pro and the risk of IA was observed for genotypic or allelic association analysis. We also examined the combined effects of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro variants on IA risk. As shown in Table 3, the carriers with the combined genotypes of rs4938723CC and TP53 Arg72Pro CG/CC/GG had a 0.27-fold decreased risk of IA (OR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11–0.70, P = 0.004), compared with those carrying rs4938723CT/TT + TP53 Arg72Pro CG/CC/GG combined genotypes, while no other association between combined effects of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro variants on IA risk was found. When stratification analysis was done by gender, no association was found (Tables 5 and 6). No significant association between the two SNPs and the number of aneurysms was observed (Table 7)."

    "content": "Results\n\nGWAS was performed on 815 children from 263 Hispanic families. Mean ± SD (range) was 25.2±7.5 (13.4 to 61.9) for the children’s BMI, 85.6±20.8 (4 to100) for BMI percentile and 1.52±1.01 (−3.0 to 4.5) for BMI z-score. Measured genotype analysis examined 129 obesity-related traits including BMI and adiposity as well as biological processes associated with the pathophysiology of childhood obesity; a description of the phenotypes is provided in Table S1. In our GWAS, population stratification was not significant and therefore did not confound our associations. A complete listing of all suggestive (p<1.0E-06) and genome-wide significant (p<1.0E-07) genetic variants and their associated traits are presented by chromosomal position in Table S2.\n\nAnthropometry and Body Composition\n\nBMI status, body composition and the growth process were assessed from repeated measurements of body weight, height, FFM and FM at baseline and after one-year ( Table 1 ). A nonsynonymous SNP (rs1056513; G1178S (NP_005790.2)) in INADL on chromosome 1 attained near genome-wide significance (p = 1.2E-07) for weight, and BMI, FFM, FM, trunk FM, and hip circumference (p = 8.3E-06 to 1.6E-07). SNP rs1056513 is common (MAF = 0.50) and accounted for 3% of the variance in body weight and body composition in this cohort. Weight z-score change was significantly associated with an intronic variant in COL4A1 on chromosome 13 (p = 4.7E-08) (Supporting Information Figure S1). Linear growth (height change) was associated with a variant in the 5′UTR region of TSEN34 on chromosome 19 (p = 4.5E-08).\n\nEndometabolic Traits\n\nGenome-wide significant variants were identified for several endometabolic traits ( Table 2 ). An intronic variant in MTNR1B on chromosome 11 was strongly associated with fasting glucose (p = 3.7E-08). Intronic and 3′UTR variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region on chromosome 11 were associated with triglycerides (p = 2.5-4.8E-08). An intronic variant in PCSK2 on chromosome 20 was associated with total antioxidants (p = 7.6E-08). Variants in the flanking 3′UTR regions of RNASE1 on chromosome 14 and ASS1P11 on chromosome 7 were associated with 24-h urinary nitrogen excretion and creatinine excretion, respectively (p = 8.2-8.4E-08). An intronic SNP in GCH1 on chromosome 14 was associated with 24-h urinary dopamine: creatinine ratio (p = 6.3E-08). A nonsynonymous SNP (rs3733402; S143T (NP_000883.2)) in KLKB1 on chromosome 4 was identified for serum free IGF-1. An intronic SNP in MPRIP on chromosome 17 was associated with serum IGFBP-3 (p = 7.2E-08). A block of twenty-three SNPs in the flanking 5′UTR region of XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) on chromosome 9 were highly associated with serum TSH (p = 5.5E-08 to 1.0E-09) and found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with one another (R = 0.91−1.00).\n\nInflammation Markers\n\nGenome-wide significant variants were identified for inflammation markers ( Table 3 ). Highly significant associations for a nonsynonymous SNP (rs12075; G42D (NP_002027.2) (p = 1.3E-21) and an intronic SNP (p = 3.6E-13) in DARC on chromosome 1 were identified for MCP-1. Coding variants in GREB1 on chromosome 2 (p = 6.5E-08) and DFNB31 on chromosome 9 (p = 2.0E-08) were also identified for MCP-1. A variants in the 3′UTR for CCR3 was highly associated with MCP1, as well as an intronic SNP in RASGEF1A (p = 4.6-9.6E-08). A variant in the intronic region of ABO was strongly associated with IL-6 (p = 2.0E-08).\n\nDiet, Energy Expenditure, Substrate Utilization and Physical Activity\n\nGenome-wide significant variants were associated with energy intake, energy expenditure and substrate utilization, and physical activity ( Table 4 ). An intronic variant in TMEM229B on chromosome 14 was associated with ad libitum energy intake at dinner (p = 5.1E-08). An intronic variant in ARHGAP11A on chromosome 15 was associated with sleep duration (p = 5.0E-08). A SNP in the intronic region of C21orf34 was detected for respiratory quotient (RQ) during sleep (p = 5.3E-08). A variant was identified for accelerometer-measured light activity in the 5′UTR region of RPL7P3 on chromosome 9 (p = 7.5E-08) and sedentary-light activity in 3′UTR of CTCFL on chromosome 20 (p = 3.6E-08). In addition, adjusting for body weight, highly significant variants were identified for total energy expenditure (p = 2.7E-08) for MATK on chromosome 19 and sleeping energy expenditure (p = 6.0E-08) for CHRNA3 on chromosome 15."

    "content": "Results\n\nAPOBR\n\nThe mutation screen of the coding region of the APOBR in 95 extremely obese children and adolescents revealed 13 sequence variants (rs74949322, rs151233, rs149271, rs3833080, rs368546180, rs180743, rs180744, rs151174, rs40831, rs61738759, rs200751685, rs40833, and rs142786317; S1 Table). Three of these affect the amino acid sequence (rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9, rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9, and rs180743: p.Pro428Ala; Table 2).\n\nThe common deletion rs3833080 (c.1036_1062del27; S1 Data) was present in each individual of the initial screen either hetero- or homozygously. The variant is located in the repeat region of APOBR with no predicted function and deletes one full repeat [GlyGlyGluGluAlaGluThrAlaSer] of the amino acid sequence. In silico prediction for rs3833080 implicated no functional effect (Table 2).\n\nThe non-synonymous, non-conservative SNP rs180743: p.Pro428Ala is located closely to the deletion rs3833080 which is in high LD with the variant (r2 = 0.98). Due to the high LD with rs2008514, both variants were carried, at least heterozygously, in all individuals of the initial screen. Functional in silico prediction for the risk allele is variable, although the SNP is located in a conserved position (conservation 66% among 29 species, ENSEMBL). SIFT and PolyPhen2 rated this SNP as deleterious, while PANTHER, SNAP and PMUT rated it as neutral (Table 2). Although the overall prediction is “Polymorphism”, Mutation Taster predicted the introduction of a new splice site, thereby disruption of a glutamate-rich region and potential loss of a phosphoserine domain (Table 2).\n\nThe deletion rs368546180 with a length of 27bp (c.933_934insdel27; p.Ala328_Gly329) results in an in frame shortened amino acid sequence of the repeat region of APOBR with no predicted function. The in silico prediction of the variant is ambiguous (Mutation Taster “Polymorphism”, SIFT “neutral”, PROVEAN “deleterious”; Table 2). It was identified once heterozygously in an extremely obese child. The female mutation carrier (height 147 cm, weight 49 kg, BMI 22.68 kg/m2, BMI SDS 1.44, age 10.5 years, 93rd age and sex specific BMI percentile) inherited the mutation from her obese mother (BMI 39.06 kg/m2) while the overweight (BMI 25.65 kg/m2) father did not harbor the deletion. The girl also homozygously carried the risk alleles (minor alleles) at rs180743: p.Pro428Ala and rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9.\n\nCase-control association analyses based on 1,873 extremely obese cases and 435 lean controls were performed for the two frequent, coding variants rs180743: p.Pro428Ala and rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9 and the second infrequent deletion rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9. The APOBR rs180743 G-allele was nominally associated with obesity (odds ratio (OR) per allele = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–1.47, p = 0.002, see Table 3). Similarly, the deletion allele of rs3833080 was nominally associated with obesity (OR = 1.25 per allele; 95%CI: 1.08–1.45, p = 0.003). Family-based association studies (based on 615 obesity trios) for rs3833080 and rs180743 confirmed these associations (Table 3). While genotyping rs3833080 we also observed the insertion allele (p.Gly369_Asp370insGluGluAlaGlyThrAlaSerGlyGly), with a much lower frequency and exclusively in (extremely) obese cases (minor allele frequency of 0.001 in 2,540 cases) but not in 481 lean or normal weight controls. The second deletion rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9 was only observed once in all screened individuals. Consequently, association analysis could not be performed (Table 3).\n\nThe remaining nine variants were located in the un-translated region (UTR) or intronic regions or were synonymous (rs74949322: c.57+50C>T, rs151233: p.Leu22 =, rs149271: p.Glu170 =, rs180744: p.Gln553 =, rs151174: p.Gly560 =, rs40831: p.Ala686 =, rs61738759: p.Pro1012 =, rs40833: c.*218C>G and rs142786317: c.*118_*119delCA; S1 Table). In silico analysis showed that the infrequent alleles at these variants caused changes of either transcription factor binding sites splicing enhancer and silencer binding sites, or both (S1 Table).\n\nSULT1A1\n\nOf the initially detected variants (7 non-synonymous, S2 Data) in the coding region of SULT1A1 in 95 extremely obese children and adolescents, none could be confirmed with an independent method. A high sequence similarity between the SULT1A gene family allowed for unspecific amplification of several SULT1A genes for individuals in the mutation screen resulting in artifacts. Hence, apart from SULT1A1 we also amplified one or more SULT1 gene family members. So that a variant that seemed to be located in SULT1A1 was in fact attributable to SULT1A2, where it represents the wild type allele (see S2 Data and S2 Table for more detail). For the variant Met1Val, which could not be explained by one of the other SULT1A family members, two independent genotyping methods could not replicate our initial uni-directional Sanger-resequencing finding. We hence deemed this variant an artifact.\n\nFor the synonymous variants in SULT1A1, in silico predictions varied. All variants were predicted to change splicing enhancer and silencers, or to directly affect splice sites or transcription factor binding sites (S1 Table). Particularly for the variant p.Pro200 = (rs3176926), both changes in the binding domains of splicing regulators as well for the transcription factor AML-1 were predicted.\n\nSULT1A2\n\nIn SULT1A2 seven non-synonymous SNPs were detected (rs4149403: p.Ile7Thr, rs10797300: p.Pro19Leu, rs145008170: p.Ser44Asn, rs4987024: p.Tyr62Phe, rs142241142: p.Ala164Val, rs1059491: p.Asn235Thr, rs75191166: p.Lys282Gly); two synonymous SNPs (rs1690407: p.Ser8 =, rs139896537: p.Ala164 =; S1 Table), and five non-coding variants (rs4149406, rs3743963, rs710410, rs762634, rs145790611; S1 Table) were also identified.\n\nFor the non-conservative, non-synonymous SNP rs1136703: p.Ile7Thr (c.20T/C), in silico analyses did not predict a functional effect (Table 2). For rs10797300: p.Pro19Leu (c.56C/T), in silico programs predicted a functional modification (PolyPhen2 and PANTHER, Table 2). The conservative non-synonymous polymorphism rs145008170: p.Ser44Asn (c.131G/A) is located close to Lys48, which is relevant for binding of the xenobiotic p-nitrophenol to the binding pocket of SULT1A2. In silico analyses predicted a “non-neutral” (SNAP) or “deleterious” (PANTHER; Table 2) functional change. The infrequent missense variants rs4987024: p.Tyr62Phe (c.185A/T) and rs142241142: p.Ala164Val (c.491C/T) are non-conservative amino acid exchanges which are not located close to the binding pocket of SULT1A2. In silico, a higher probability of functional changes was predicted for p.Tyr62Phe than for p.Ala164Val (Poly Phen 2 “probably damaging”), although the analyses revealed mixed results (Table 2). In silico prediction mostly interpreted the conservative SNP rs1059491: p.Asn235Thr (c.704A/C) as functionally relevant (“probably damaging” PolyPhen2, “non-neutral” SNAP and “deleterious” SIFT; Table 2). None of the analyzed non-synonymous SNPs in SULT1A2 showed association with obesity in 355 obesity trios (TDT; Table 3).\n\n In silico predictions vary for the two known synonymous SNPs (rs1690407: p.Ser8 =, rs139896537: p.Ala164 =) and the five non-coding variants (rs4149406: c.148+34T/C, rs3743963: c.500−19T/C, rs710410: c.*7T/C, rs762634: c.*14A>G, rs145790611: c.241+39G/A). For each variant, at least a change in either transcription factor binding sites or splicing enhancer or silencer sites was predicted (S1 Table).\n\nTUFM\n\nIn TUFM, the previously unknown variant c.3536C>G was detected in the 3’ untranslated region (previously unknown). In addition, non-coding intronic variants were detected (rs7187776: c.-55T>C, rs4788099: c.817+13T>C, rs8061877: c.248−18G>A, and rs61737565: c.922+29C>G). All five variants in TUFM are predicted to lead to altered splicing regulator or transcription factor binding sites (S1 Table). For rs8061877, the disruption of a transcription factor binding site was predicted (TFSearch and Consite), although for different transcription factors (SRY, HFH 2, HMG-IY; S1 Table). For the previously unknown variant g.28854194C/G, in silico prediction showed a change in splice enhancer binding sites and splicing silencer sites by three programs (S1 Table). Also, alterations in splice sites for this variant were predicted (Mutation Taster) despite the variant being in the non-coding 3’ UTR of TUFM."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nEstimation of ovarian cancer risks associated with minor alleles of SNPs in inflammation-related genes began with analysis of 162 successfully genotyped SNPs in approximately 900 epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 1,000 controls described in Supplemental Table 1. Twenty-one SNPs (in ALOX15, ALOX5, CCL2, CRP, IL18, IL1A, IL1B, IL6, NOS3, and PTGS1) were associated with risk of ovarian cancer with per-allele p’s < 0.10. Two SNPs were associated at p < 0.01: ALOX5 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) rs1864414 (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64–0.92, p=0.004) and NOS3 (nitric oxide synthase 3) rs743507 (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92, p=0.003). Analyses within ALOX12, CCL11, CCL3, CCR3, CXCL16, IL10, IL15RA, IL1RN, IL4R, IL6R, IL7R, IL8RA, IL8RB, IL9, PTGS2, TLR2, and TNF did not suggest associations between genotype and risk of ovarian cancer (p’s > 0.10). Complete results are provided in Supplemental Table 4.\n\nTwenty-one SNPs with p < 0.10 in discovery analysis were evaluated in an additional approximate 3,100 cases and 2,100 controls described in Supplemental Table 3, and, to enable combined analysis, discovery data were re-analyzed excluding self-reported non-whites and adjusted for only study site. These results and estimates of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r2) are shown in Table 1. Of 21 SNPs in 10 genes, those in IL1A (interleukin 1, alpha) and ALOX5 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) were associated at p-value < 0.01 in combined analysis.\n\nTwo highly-correlated SNPs in IL1A (rs17561 and rs4848300, r2=0.990) yielded essentially identical results, showing associations with decreased risk of ovarian cancer in combined analyses (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.97, p=0.005). Replication analysis yielded p’s < 0.05 (Table 1), and results were consistent between discovery and replication phases (heterogeneity p=0.30; Figure 1). IL1A rs17561 (MAF=0.31) is a missense change (A114S), and rs4848300 (MAF=0.32) resides 3,586 bp from the 3′ end of the gene. As other loosely-correlated IL1A SNPs (r2=0.300) were also associated with ovarian cancer risk (rs3783516 and rs2856838, r2=0.993, OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03–1.18, p=0.01), we attempted logistic regression including all four IL1A SNPs in the combined dataset. However, modeling was uninformative due to convergence issues and unstable parameter estimates.\n\nOf particular interest, analysis of IL1A rs17561 by histological subtype revealed evidence of heterogeneity (p=0.03, Figure 2). Specifically, an inverse association was present for risk of clear cell subtype (p=0.004), mucinous subtype (p=0.02), and endometrioid subtype (p=0.01), yet absent for risk of the more common (54%) serous subtype (p=0.26). Consistently, the risk estimate for tumors with mixed or unknown histology was intermediate to those for rarer subtypes and serous subtype (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75–1.01, Figure 2).\n\nIn combined analysis, the estimated ovarian cancer risk associated with minor alleles at ALOX5 rs1864414 (MAF=0.18, intron 1), one of the strongest initial discovery set signals, was 0.86 (95% CI 0.79–0.95, p=0.002). Results were consistent between discovery and replication datasets (heterogeneity p=0.71), and, with the exception of POL, risk estimates were less than 1.0 in each study (Figure 1). Because a correlated ALOX5 SNP was also associated with ovarian cancer risk (rs745986, r2=0.651, OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–0.97, p=0.01), we included both SNPs in regression modeling. Results suggested that rs1864414 was driving the association (rs1864414 OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75–1.03, p=0.009; rs745986 OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85–1.14, p=0.11). No heterogeneity by histological subtype was observed (p=0.74)\n\nAs shown in Table 1, combined analyses at IL1B (interleukin 1, beta) rs7596684 and PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1) rs2282169 suggested association with ovarian cancer risk (p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively). Results were null or inconsistent with study phases at SNPs in ALOX15, CCL2, CRP, IL18, and IL6. Among women with available age information, combined analyses adjusting additionally for age yielded similar results at all SNPs."

    "content": "Results\n\nThe population characteristics of childhood ALL cases included in our study were summarized in Table 2. There were 118 cases recruited from Texas Children’s Cancer Center from 2003 to 2010, including 65 males and 53 females. For the study period, the participation rate was 85%. Of the 118 families, 36% were complete triads, however, based on previous assessments this is unlikely to bias the results. The study included individuals of all racial/ethnic groups, 59 non-Hispanic whites, 6 non-Hispanic blacks, 46 Hispanics, and 7 belonging to other racial/ethnic groups. All the cases were under 14 years old when recruited.\n\nWe analyzed 128 tagging SNPs of 16 folate metabolic genes to identify SNPs associated with childhood ALL. The SNPs with posterior probability of inclusion greater than 0.2 in the initial screening within each chromosome proceeded to the final analysis. In the initial screening, 7 SNPs among the 128 tagging SNPs were identified, 2 SNPs in gene MTHFD2, 3 SNPs in gene BHMT2, 1 SNP in gene NOS3, and 1 SNP in gene SLC19A1 (Table 3).\n\nIn the final analysis of 7 selected SNPs from initial screening, NOS3 rs3918186 and SLC19A1 rs1051266 had Bayes factors greater than 1 (Table 4). In other words, the posterior odds of including the two SNPs in the model were greater than the prior odds of including the two SNPs, indicating that our data supported the association between the two SNPs and childhood ALL risk. Specifically, NOS3 rs3918186 had a Bayes Factor of 7.38, whereby for each copy of the minor allele, there was a 2.16 times risk of developing childhood ALL (OR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.51-3.15). We found less evidence in our data for SLC19A1 rs1051266 being associated with childhood ALL. For each copy of the minor allele of SLC19A1 rs1051266, there was a 2.07 times risk of developing childhood ALL (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.25-3.46)."

    "content": "Results\n\nBaseline Characteristics and Genotyping\n\nThe overall study consisted of 108 study participants after exclusions for lack of genotyping consent (n=9) and incomplete genotype data (n=3). Genotyping success rate of the 4 SNPs chosen to define the FADS1/2 haplotype as described in Methods, was between 96.7% and 98.3%. Minor allele frequencies were in the range of 25.0% to 32.9%. The genotype distribution for each SNP did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p >0.05).\n\nBaseline characteristics for the Healthy Eating diet group (n = 54) and the Mediterranean diet group (n = 54) were summarized in Table 1. No significant differences were found in minor allele frequency of any SNP, gender, race, age, or BMI between the two diet groups at baseline. Likewise, baseline measurements of AA, EPA, and long chain n-3 fatty acids (the sum of EPA and DHA) did not differ significantly in the serum or the colonic mucosa between the two diet groups (Table 1).\n\nBaseline measures\n\nLinear regression analysis indicated that the number of minor alleles was a significant predictor of baseline serum AA concentration (p < 0.001) and almost significant for colonic AA concentration (p = 0.058). A greater number of minor alleles was significantly associated with lower AA concentration in serum. Dietary AA intakes were not a significant predictor of either serum of colon concentrations. For long chain n-3 fatty acids, however, the situation was the reverse. Dietary intake of long chain n-3 fatty acids was a significant predictor of baseline serum long chain n-3 concentration (p < 0.001) and colonic long chain n-3 concentration (p = 0.044) while the number of minor alleles was not a significant predictor of either.\n\nSubsequent analyses were done categorizing subjects into two groups by presence or absence of any minor alleles in the FADS gene cluster. The only dietary or demographic factor to differ by genotype at baseline was BMI, which was lower in carriers of any minor alleles (mean of 27.8, SD 3.7, in all major allele carriers and mean of 26.1, SD 3.6, in carriers of any minor alleles, p=0.02 by the 2-sided t-test). Age was not significantly different (p=0.11) but was retained as a covariate. No significant difference was found for other demographic characteristics (race, gender, smoking, common medication use) between minor allele and all major allele carriers. Results were similar when using any one SNP individually versus all minor SNPS (not shown).\n\nSerum and colon fatty acid concentrations at baseline by genotype group are shown in Table 2. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate differences between genotype groups. The presence of any minor alleles was highly significantly associated with baseline serum 20:4, n-6 concentrations (p<0.0001) and 18:3, n-3 concentration (p=0.01), and marginally significant for colonic 20:4, n-6 concentration (p = 0.07), with adjustment for age, BMI, and dietary intakes of n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA and/or long chain n-3 PUFA as a percentage of energy. Specifically, mean serum 20:4, n-6 concentration (% of total fatty acids) for minor allele carriers were estimated to be 2% (95% CI = [1%, 3%]) lower, whereas mean serum 18:3, n-3 concentration for minor allele carriers were estimated to be 21% (95% CI = [4%, 41%]) higher, compared to those individuals with all major alleles in the four SNPs in FADS. There was no significant association of genotype with EPA nor with long chain n-3 fatty acids (the sum of EPA and DHA). Genotype group also had no significant effects on total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, insulin, glucose, and CRP with p>0.11 in each case (not shown).\n\nEffects of Dietary Intervention on Fatty Acid Intakes and Fatty Acid Concentrations in Serum and Colon\n\nWe first evaluated changes in fatty acids by diet group assignment alone without considering the genotype groups. Table 3 displays dietary intakes, serum, and colon fatty acid concentrations for the two diet arms at baseline and after 6 months of intervention. Based on data from food records and 24-hour recalls, dietary intakes of saturated fats (SFA) and monounsaturated fats (MUFA) were significantly reduced (p<0.0001) and long chain n-3 PUFA was significantly increased (p=0.004) in the Healthy Eating group after 6 months. The decrease in mean SFA resulted in an increased polyunsaturated fat: saturated fat ratio from 0.60 to 0.92 in the Healthy Eating group (p=0.008 from mixed linear regression models controlling for age). In the Mediterranean group, dietary intakes of SFA and n-6 PUFA both significantly decreased (p<0.0001), while MUFA and long chain n-3 PUFA significantly increased (p<0.0001), in accord with the counseling goals. The mean polyunsaturated fat: saturated fat ratio increased non-significantly from 0.72 to 0.77 in the Mediterranean group.\n\nSerum 18:2 n-6 significantly decreased (p=0.02), and both MUFA and n-3 PUFA significantly increased (p=0.0005 and p=0.01, respectively) in the Mediterranean arm only (Table 3). There was little change in colon fatty acid concentrations. The only significant change was for long chain n-3 PUFA that significantly increased in both Healthy Eating (p=0.01) and Mediterranean groups (p=0.01).\n\nInteractions of Genotype and Diet Intervention\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show the raw means in each group over time. Table 4 shows the linear mixed model results for the analysis of the genotype by diet interaction. There was a significant interaction of genotype by diet for 20:4, n-6 (AA) concentrations in the colon (p=0.004). No significant genotype-by-diet interactions were found for AA in serum nor for EPA. Among subjects with no minor alleles, mean colon AA concentrations were estimated to be 16% (95% CI = [5%, 26%]) lower for the Mediterranean arm than the Healthy Eating arm at 6 months. These results indicate that after adjusting for baseline AA concentrations, mean colon AA concentrations at 6 months were significantly different between diet arms only in persons with no minor alleles in the FADS1/2 gene cluster. This was mainly due to an increase in colon AA in the Healthy Eating diet arm while colon AA concentrations remained fairly constant in the Mediterranean group."

    "content": "Results\n\nSnoring prevalence and risk factors\n\nOur population-based discovery sample consisted of 408,317 individuals of white British ancestry from the UK Biobank. Participants in the sample were deemed as snoring ‘cases’ (37%) based on their report that a partner or housemate had complained to the participant about their snoring (see Methods and Table 1). Snoring was significantly associated with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.011 [per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.009–1.012]) and, to a greater extent, with sex (ORmales = 2.264 [2.212–2.316]). The prevalence of sleep apnoea was higher within the snorer group (Table 1). Furthermore, BMI, SES, smoking frequency and alcohol consumption frequency were also associated with snoring (Fig. 1a). Although snoring prevalence was higher in males, BMI was positively correlated with snoring prevalence in both males and females (Fig. 1b). A lower SES, as determined by both Townsend deprivation index and average household income, was associated with increased snoring in males only. Smoking frequency was positively correlated with snoring prevalence in females and, to a lesser extent, in males (Fig. 1a–c). In contrast, alcohol consumption frequency was correlated with snoring in males and, to a lesser extent, in females (Fig. 1a–d). We further identified other factors such as whole-body fat mass and sleep duration that are correlated with snoring (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nDiscovery GWAS and SNP heritability\n\nWe performed a GWAS study of snoring, taken as a dichotomous variable (n = 408,317; cases ~152,000; controls ~256,000). After quality control (QC; see Methods), 11,010,159 genetic variants remained in the analysis. This uncovered 127 independent genome-wide significant associations across 41 genomic risk loci (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Annotation for the top 15 risk loci is shown in Table 2 and a list of all genomic risk loci is given in Supplementary Data 1. The overall SNP heritability on the liability scale (h2SNP) was 9.9% (SE = 0.39%).\n\nGenetic correlations\n\nThe trait that showed the highest genetic correlation with habitual snoring was self-reported sleep apnoea (rG = 0.78, SE = 0.17, p-value = 3 × 10−05[ldsc χ2-test]; Supplementary Data 2). We also analysed the genetic correlation between snoring and three measures of overnight oxyhemoglobin saturation: average SpO2, minimum SpO2 saturation and percent of sleep with oxyhemoglobin saturation under 90% (Perc90). Minimum SpO2 and Perc90, which are known proxies for sleep-disordered breathing, but not average SpO2 (which reflects changes in ventilation not necessarily related to sleep apnoea), showed moderate significant genetic correlations with snoring (Fig. 3). Other traits genetically correlated to snoring included BMI, whole-body fat mass, sodium in urine, mood swings, coronary artery disease, alcohol intake frequency, pulse rate, current tobacco smoking, heart disease, lung cancer, the ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), neuroticism, subjective wellbeing and heart rate, among others. Traits showing a negative genetic correlation with snoring included schizophrenia, FVC, FEV1, fluid intelligence score, educational attainment, age at menarche, mean accumbens volume and anorexia nervosa. Overall, traits related to BMI, risk for psychiatric disease, lung function and heart disease were among those with the strongest evidence of association (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 2). Notably, pulse rate, whole-body fat mass and BMI were also phenotypically associated with snoring in this sample (see above and Supplementary Table 1).\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nWe performed two follow-up sensitivity GWAS to explore the effects of BMI, adiposity and nonlinear effects on associated variants. The first sensitivity GWAS included BMI as a covariate, whereas the second included BMI, BMI2, age × sex, age2 and whole-body fat mass. Both sensitivity analyses showed very similar results, with a genetic correlation of 0.9998 (SE = 0.0002). We therefore focus below on the simple model adjusting only for BMI and basic covariates (see Methods). The results revealed 97 genome-wide significant SNPs across 34 genomic risk loci (Fig. 2a) with overall SNP heritability on the liability scale (h2SNP) of 8.67% (SE = 0.39) (Table 3). Although most of the lead SNP effect sizes remained very similar, the signal in the FTO locus showed a strong change after BMI adjustment (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 1). Further, after adjusting for BMI, snoring was no longer genetically correlated with BMI and adiposity-related phenotypes, nor with heart attack, hypertension, alcohol and smoking habits. Traits that remained genetically correlated with snoring after adjusting for BMI included schizophrenia, educational attainment, sodium in urine and sleep-related traits such as daytime dozing, sleep apnoea and excessive daytime sleepiness. Notably, measures of nocturnal hypoxia such as minimum SpO2, average SpO2 and Perc90 showed small increases in their genetic correlation with snoring after adjusting for BMI (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 3). The genetic correlation between both the adjusted and unadjusted GWAS was high (rG = 0.923, SE = 0.003, p-value = 1 × 10−300), suggesting that a considerable amount of snoring predisposition is not fully explained by BMI.\n\nPositional, eQTL and gene-based test prioritization\n\nTo gain insights into the functional consequences of individual genome-wide significant variants, we used positional and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, as well as genome-wide gene-based association analyses. From positional and eQTL mapping, we identified 149 protein-coding genes mapping to a genome-wide significant SNP. The nearest genes to the top signals included DLEU7 on chromosome 13 and MSRB3 on chromosome 12. In addition to DLEU7 and MSRB3, other compelling genes (prioritized by positional or eQTL mapping) for snoring included BCL11B, FTO, SMG6, ROBO2, NSUN3, SNAP91 and BCL2, which have previously been associated with smoking; BLC11B, FTO, RNA5SP471 and SND1 and NSUN3, previously associated with alcohol consumption; FTO and SND1, associated with coffee consumption; LMO4 associated with insomnia; and RNA5SP471 with narcolepsy. In addition, ROBO2 was previously associated with chronotype and multiple genes (DLEU7, MSRB3, FTO, ANAPC4, SMG6, SND1, SIM1, KCNQ5, CEP120, MACF1, SNAP91 and BCL2) previously associated with musculoskeletal traits such as height and heel bone mineral density (Supplementary Data 1 and  2). Genome-wide gene-based association analysis identified 179 genes associated with snoring beyond genome-wide significance (p < 2.636e − 6; Bonferroni-corrected threshold for 18,971 tested genes) several of which were consistent with the mapped genes. After adjusting for BMI, 104 protein-coding genes were identified mapping to a genome-wide significant SNP from the positional and eQTL mapping, whereas 120 genes remained significantly associated with snoring, including both MSRB3 and DLEU7 (see Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2 and 3). eQTL data obtained from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and mapped with Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (FUMA) highlighted significant SNPs that were associated with the expression of genes in several tissues including the lungs, blood, oesophagus, breast mammary, tibial nerve, and several areas of the brain, such as the cerebellum and hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 2). In summary, many of the mapped genes for snoring have been previously associated with other traits and diseases, primarily grouped into cardiometabolic, cognitive/neurological, respiratory and psychiatric (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 1).\n\nTo further assess whether significant genes converged in functional gene sets and pathways, we conducted gene-set enrichment analyses of tissue expression data (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Genes expressed in blood vessel and tibial artery tissue were associated with snoring, even after adjusting for BMI (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Given these associations, and an observed genetic correlation between snoring and pulse rate (rG = 0.106, SE = 0.03, p-value = 0.001), we conducted a two-sample generalized summary-data-based MR (GSMR) to test for a possible causal relationship. The analysis suggested a one-way causal relationship in which snoring increased pulse rate (Supplementary Fig. 4). We further explored the association between snoring and BMI, whole-body fat mass, blood pressure, major coronary heart disease and heart attack. GSMR results suggested a bidirectional causal relationship, with snoring exerting a causal effect on BMI, but also BMI exerting a causal effect on snoring, and a similar pattern was observed for heart attack. In addition, one-way causal relationships were seen for whole-body fat mass causing snoring and for snoring causing an increase in blood pressure (Supplementary Fig. 4). To control for possible confounding due to sample overlap, we conducted GSMR analyses using sex-stratified GWAS results (see Methods). The results supported causal relationships between BMI (and whole-body fat mass) causing snoring, whereas all other associations did not reach statistical significance after controlling for multiple testing (Supplementary Table 2). We performed further sensitivity analyses using five different MR methods that test different assumptions (Fig. 5). The results of GSMR, inverse variance weighted (IVW-MR) and weighted median analyses supported a causal effect of BMI (and whole-body fat mass) on snoring. Notably, although the MR-Egger estimates did not reach statistical significance, the Egger intercept was not significantly different from zero.\n\nSex-stratified GWAS\n\nGiven the higher prevalence of snoring in males, we conducted GWAS analyses stratified by sex. These analyses identified 4 and 25 genome-wide significant SNPs for snoring in males and females, respectively. SNP heritability on the liability scale (h2SNP) was 8.77% (SE = 0.54%) and 12.42% (SE = 0.57%), respectively, for males and females (Table 3). In the sensitivity analyses, SNP heritability (h2SNP) was slightly lower after adjusting for BMI in both males 7.72% (SE = 0.56%) and females 10.85% (SE = 0.54%) (Table 3). We identified two loci (lead SNPs rs199797821 and rs200391180) with a significantly different effect size between sexes, although in the same direction. The cross-sex genetic correlation was high (rG = 0.914, SE = 0.033, p-value = 1.91 × 10−160), and effect sizes and directions for top hits were highly consistent in both the male and female samples (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Fig. 5).\n\nPGS and prediction on an independent sample\n\nWe used the discovery GWAS summary statistics to derive PGS in an independent target sample from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study (AGDS). The prevalence of self-reported recent snoring was 32%, with a higher prevalence in males than in females (43.2% and 28.1%, respectively). PGS for snoring were significantly associated with recent snoring for all but one (p < = 5e − 8) of the p-value inclusion thresholds (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Participants in the highest snoring PGS decile had around twice the odds of reporting recent snoring and choking or struggling for breath during sleep (i.e., probable OSA; sample prevalence = 8.2%) compared with those on the lowest decile (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, the PGS showed a stronger association with increasing frequency of snoring severity (Fig. 6b). Finally, we showed that the snoring PGS explained a significant amount of variance in recent snoring (Fig. 6c)."

Distribution of Neonatal and Maternal Vitamin D Status According to VDBP Polymorphisms\n\nDistributions of vitamin D status of maternal–neonatal dyads according to VDBP polymorphisms are presented in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6. Data and p values were adjusted for maternal height (cm), BMI pre-pregnancy (kg/m2), BMI terminal (kg/m2), UVB and weeks of gestation by one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Covariates appearing in the model are evaluated at the following values: BMI pre-pregnancy (kg/m2) = 25.09, BMI terminal (kg/m2) = 29.73 and weeks of gestation = 38.81. No significant difference was observed in any comparisons after adjustment. Mean concentrations of maternal and neonatal vitamin D status (total 25(OH)D), according to maternal and neonatal VDBP polymorphisms, as well as distribution of different states of maternal and neonatal vitamin D equilibrium, were not different among different genotype profiles of VDBP.\n\n3.2.

    "content": "Results\n\nStudy Subjects\n\nThe biochemical and clinical characteristics of women with PCOS and control subjects are presented in Table 1. Comparable age, menarche, waist-hip ratio, along with lipid profile, total testosterone, LH and FSH levels at examination, were seen between women with PCOS and control women. Significant differences between cases and controls were noted for mean BMI (P <0.001), free testosterone (P = 0.009), bioactive testosterone (P = 0.004), free androgen index (FAI; P = 0.015), fasting insulin (P <0.001), and the insulin resistance index HOMA-IR (P <0.001). Significantly lower levels of SHBG (P <0.001), and higher levels of TSH (P = 0.006) (though within reference range) were noted between women with PCOS and controls. Accordingly, we controlled for these covariates in later analysis.\n\nVEGFA SNPs analysis\n\nA total of 12 VEGFA SNPs were selected for this analysis based on their established MAFs of >5% in Caucasians. MAFs of the 12 tested VEGFA SNPs between women with PCOS and control women are presented in Table 2. All the SNPs conformed to HWE (P <0.005). MAF of rs3025020 (-583T>C) was higher in women with PCOS than control women (0.34 vs. 0.29; P = 9.0 × 10−4). The MAF of other 11 SNPs were not significantly different between women with PCOS and control subjects.\n\nVEGFA Genotype distribution\n\nSignificant difference in rs3025020 (-583T>C), and to a lesser extent rs2010963 (-634C>G) genotype distribution was seen between PCOS cases and control women (Table 3). There was enrichment of homozygous minor allele carrying genotypes -583C/C in PCOS cases (0.14 vs. 0.09), and heterozygous -634C/G genotypes in control women (0.48 vs. 0.37) (Table 3). For the remaining variants, comparable distribution of genotypes was seen among women with PCOS and controls. Taking homozygous major allele genotype as reference, increased risk of PCOS was found to be associated with -583T/C [OR (95% CI) = 1.89 (1.09–3.26)], while reduced PCOS risk was seen with only -634C/G [OR (95% CI) = 0.65 (0.44–0.97)] genotypes, thus assigning PCOS susceptibility and protective nature to these genotypes, respectively.\n\nVEGF serum levels and PCOS features\n\nMean serum VEGF levels were significantly increased (P = 0.007), and reduced (P = 0.048) among rs3025020 and rs2010963 genotype carriers, respectively (Table 4). There was progressive increase in fasting insulin (P = 0.033) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.050), and bioactive testosterone (P = 0.042) in rs3025020 genotype carriers. On the other hand, significant reduction in fasting insulin (P = 0.012), free testosterone (P = 0.007) and bioactive testosterone (P = 0.001) in rs2010963 genotype carriers (Table 4).\n\nCorrelation studies\n\nCorrelation analysis were used to investigate the relationship between VEGFA rs30250202 and rs2010963 genotypes and PCOS-associated features; separate analyses were performed for each of the two VEGFA SNPs (Table 5). In the model including rs3025020, carriage of the minor (C) allele was positively associated with hs-CRP. On the other hand, in the model including rs2010963, there was a negative association between the presence of the minor allele (C) with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), but not with hs-CRP. There was no correlation between either rs3025020 or rs2010963 with the extent of obesity or hypertension, with oligomenorrhea, or with altered levels of (anti-inflammatory) IL-10 or (pro-inflammatory) IL-6 and TNFα."

    "content": "Results\n\nStudy 1\n\nGenotype groups did not differ on self-report measures (Table 1). Replicating prior studies in independent samples (e.g.,), participants successfully modulated their behavior according to reinforcement contingencies; for response bias, a main effect of Block emerged [F(2,344) = 4.16, p = .018] driven by higher response bias in Blocks 3 [mean±SD: 0.19±0.23; t(173) = 3.08, p = .002] and 2 [0.15±0.21; t(173) = 1.80, p = .073] compared to Block 1 (0.12±0.19). Critically, a main effect of Genotype was also found [F(1,172) = 4.77, p = .030, Cohen’s d = 0.38] due to higher response bias in val carriers (0.19±0.15) relative to iso homozygotes (0.14±0.15) (Figure 2). The main effect of Genotype was confirmed when considering Caucasian subjects only [F(1,118) = 4.47, p < .04, Cohen’s d = 0.45], suggesting that findings were not confounded by population stratification. For discriminability, only a trend emerged for Block [F(2,344) = 2.86, p = .064], due to higher discriminability in block 3 (0.85±0.28) and 2 (0.85±0.30) relative to block 1 (0.81±0.29), both ps < .06.\n\nStudy 2\n\nDemographic, self-report, and stress data (Table 2)\n\nGenotype groups did not differ on any demographic or self-report variables. An independent t-test revealed that group differences in shock intensity approached significance, [t(48) = 1.97, p = .055; Cohen’s d = 0.77]; relative to iso homozygotes (2.31±0.90 milliamperes), val carriers selected a lower level of shock intensity to be highly aversive (1.66±0.47 milliamperes). The ANOVA on STAI scores produced main effects of Condition [F(1,51) = 18.17, p < .001] and Time [F(1,51) = 38.28, p < .001]. These main effects were qualified by a Condition × Time interaction [F(1,51) = 12.90, p = .001; Figure 3A]. Post-hoc tests revealed that, as intended, participants reported significantly higher STAI scores during the stress (44.67±9.70) relative to no-stress (39.39±7.16) condition [t(52) = 4.44, p < .001], whereas no significant differences emerged for the pre-stress assessments [no-stress: 34.51±7.11, stress: 35.46±6.96; t(52) = 1.22, p = .23]. Additionally, for both the stress and no-stress condition, STAI scores significantly increased over the course of the experiment, both ts >5.66, both ps < .001. A Time × Condition × Genotype trend emerged [F(1,51) = 3.89, p = .054], but follow-up t-tests revealed no significant differences between genotypes, all ps > .26.\n\nFor PANAS NA, main effects of Condition [F(1,51) =25.13, p < .001] and Time [F(1,51) = 17.42, p < .001] emerged. A significant Condition × Time interaction qualified these main effects [F(1,51) = 17.11, p < .001; Figure 3B]. Participants reported elevated NA scores during the stress (14.63±4.06) relative to the no-stress (12.09±2.39) condition as well as elevated NA scores prior to the stress (11.81±1.77) relative to the no-stress (11.30±1.41) condition, both ts > 2.25, both ps < .03. Additionally, for both the stress and no-stress condition, NA scores significantly increased over the course of the experiment, both ts > 2.75, both ps < .01. In addition, trends for a Time × Condition × Genotype [F(1,51) = 3.65, p = .062] and Time × Genotype [F(1,51) = 2.95, p = .092] interaction emerged. Independent samples t-tests showed, however, no differences between genotype groups, all ps > .15. For PANAS positive affect, no significant effects emerged, all ps > .21.\n\nWhen considering non-specific SC responses, the expected main effect of Condition emerged [F(1,42) = 4.47, p = .04], due to significantly more responses in the stress (4.01±2.58) compared to no-stress (3.32±2.18) condition (Figure 3C). A trending effect for Genotype was observed [F(1,42) = 3.39, p = .07, Cohen’s d = 0.72]; as expected based on prior findings, val carriers (4.56±3.76) had more SC responses than iso homozygotes (2.77±1.91). Collectively, these findings indicate that the stress manipulation was successful; participants reported elevated anxiety and negative affect, and had more non-specific SC responses in the stress relative to no-stress condition. With the exception of a trend for higher skin conductance responses in val carriers, the effects of the stress manipulation were similar across genotypes.\n\nProbabilistic reward task\n\nReplicating prior findings, a significant main effect of Condition emerged for response bias [F(1,51) = 6.32, p = .015], due to reduced response bias toward the more frequently rewarded stimulus in the stress (0.02±0.16) relative to no-stress (0.14±0.16) condition (reported in more detail in). Most importantly, this effect was qualified by a Genotype × Condition interaction [F(1,51) = 5.12, p = .028; Figure 4). Relative to iso homozygotes, val carriers had significantly lower response bias in the stress condition [−0.05±0.16 vs. 0.08±0.15; t(51) = 2.27, p = .03, Cohen’s d = 0.89]. No differences emerged within the no-stress [val carrier: 0.18±0.22 vs. iso homozygote: 0.10±0.15; t(51) = 1.41, p = .16, Cohen’s d = 0.55] condition. In addition, within-group analyses indicated that val carriers tended to have lower response bias in the stress relative to no-stress condition [t(7) = 2.29, p = .056, Cohen’s d = 1.22], while iso homozygotes did not differ between conditions [t(44) = 0.33, p = .74]. Figure 4C displays the distribution of response bias in the stress and no-stress condition for iso homozygotes and val carriers; the correlation between stress and no-stress response bias was not significant in either group (iso homozygotes: r = −.27, p = .07; val carriers: r = −.10, p = .82).\n\nControl analyses\n\nFor discriminability, a main effect of Block emerged [F(2,102) = 3.80, p = .026], due to elevated discriminability in Blocks 3 (0.41±0.02) and 2 (0.40±0.02) relative to Block 1 (0.35±0.02), both ps < .02. Additionally, a Condition × Block × Genotype interaction emerged [F(2,102) = 3.76, p = .027]. Independent t-tests revealed, however, no differences between genotype groups in any block.\n\nFinally, three sets of hierarchical regressions were conducted to confirm that MR genotype differences in response bias were not confounded by differences in discriminability, shock intensity, skin conductance responses, or other genotypes. In all regressions, possible nuisance variables were entered in the first step, MR genotype was entered in the second step, and the difference in response bias between stress and no-stress was entered as the criterion variable. In the first model, discriminability in both conditions was entered in the first step. In the second, shock intensity and skin conductance responses were entered in the first step. Finally, in the third model, three CRHR1 SNPs (i.e. rs12938031, rs10445364, rs4076452) recently associated with stress-induced reward learning deficits were entered in the first step. Findings confirmed that the val allele still explained unique variance of stress-induced response bias reductions after accounting for (1) discriminability [ΔR2 = .09, ΔF(1,49) = 5.08, p = .03], (2) shock intensity and skin conductance responses in both conditions [ΔR2 = .23, ΔF(1,41) = 12.45, p = .001], and (3) CRHR1 SNPs [ΔR2 = .05, ΔF(1,44) = 3.24, p = .08]."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nA total of 2 446 724 SNPs common to both studies were tested for association with ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth at one year’. All analyses were adjusted for gestational age, sex and age, where appropriate (see Materials and Methods). Results from the two studies were combined using fixed effects inverse variance meta-analysis, where effect size estimates are weighted according to the inverse of their standard errors. Q–Q plots indicated little inflation of the test statistics in the individual cohorts and for the meta-analysis overall (‘Age at first tooth’ LAMBDA ALSPAC = 1.04; ‘Age at first tooth’LAMBDA NFBC1966 = 1.05; LAMBDA META = 1.07; ‘Number of teeth’: LAMBDA ALSPAC = 1.02; LAMBDA NFBC1966 = 1.04; LAMBDA META = 1.06) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). The genomic inflation factor λ is well known to increase with sample size; we, therefore, also calculated λ1000 values for the ‘Age at first tooth’ (λ1000 = 1.01) and ‘Number of teeth’ (λ1000 = 1.00) meta-analyses. Both values are consistent with little latent population stratification or other systematic biases affecting our results.\n\nWe identified 10 loci reaching genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) for ‘age at first tooth’ and a further 11 loci for ‘number of teeth’, giving a total of 15 independent loci (Fig. 1). The full GWAS results corresponding to Figure 1 are available from the Human Molecular Genetics website. Table 1 shows the top-ranking SNPs for each phenotype at each locus. Eight of these loci are novel associations; the top SNPs at these loci are rs17563 (BMP4), rs10740993 (CACNB2), rs4937076 (CDON), rs1799922 (CALU/OPN1SW), rs997154 (AJUBA/C14orf93), rs7924176 (ADK), rs412000 (TEX14/RAD51C) and rs9316505 (DLEU7). Four of the loci identified confirm previously reported genes/regions (KCNJ2, MSRB3, IGF2BP1 and EDA). Furthermore, we detected genome-wide significance for the variant rs17101923 in the HMGA2 region (‘number of teeth’ P = 1.1 × 10−10, Table 1), rs10932688 in the 2q35 region and the rs6568401 variant in the 6q21 region, which were identified at suggestive levels of significance in a previous study. We also note that SNPs at the RAD51L1 locus reported as genome-wide significant for association with ‘number of teeth’ in Pillas et al. did not meet the 5 × 10−8 threshold in this study, although there was still suggestive evidence for association at this locus [‘Age at first tooth’ (rs17105278): P = 2.1 × 10−6; ‘Number of teeth’(rs1956529): P = 6.4 × 10−7].  \n\nEach SNP that reached genome-wide significance explained only a small fraction of the overall phenotypic variation in ‘age at first tooth’ (0.05–1.14%, ALSPAC; 0.06–1.45%, NFBC1966) and ‘number of teeth’ (0.09–0.94%, ALSPAC; 0.03–0.92%, NFBC1966). Pooling together the effects of the top SNPs at the genome-wide significant loci (Table 1) into a single allelic score explained 6.06% of the overall phenotypic variation in ‘age at first tooth’ and 4.76% of the variation in ‘number of teeth’. We also report loci displaying suggestive levels of association (Supplementary Material, Tables S1 and S2), 5 × 10−6 > P > 5 × 10−8, which included SNPs in the TMEM9 region that were reported as genome-wide significant in the study of secondary dentition by Geller et al..\n\nSupplementary Material, Figures S2 and S3 show LocusZoom plots of regression analyses for ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth’, respectively, at each genome-wide significant locus after meta-analysis. For most loci, there appeared to be evidence of secondary signals independent of the lead SNP at the locus. To quantify the evidence for independent secondary signals, we first calculated the effective number of statistical tests in each region using Nyholt's procedure. For each locus, we estimated the threshold for a family-wise error rate of 5% by dividing alpha = 0.05 by the corresponding number of effective tests in that region, and used this threshold for declaring a secondary signal as significant. These thresholds as well as the strongest P-value in each region after conditioning on the lead SNP are presented in Supplementary Material, Table S3. These analyses showed that there were likely to be independent secondary signals at rs11077486 (KCNJ2 KCNJ160), rs2520397 (FAM155E–EDA), rs1951867 (BMP4), rs1472259 (HMGA2) and rs8069452 (IGF2BP1) for ‘age at first tooth’ and rs9788982 (KCNJ2 KCNJ160), rs2804391 (FAM155E–EDA), rs1458991 (BMP4), rs9894411 (IGF2BP1), rs1976274 (MSRB3) and rs1472259 (HMGA2) for ‘number of teeth’ (Supplementary Material, Table S3).\n\nWe next investigated whether the SNPs at our top loci have pleiotropic effects, specifically whether they are associated with both primary tooth and craniofacial development. A recent GWAS investigated the genetic determinants of 54 measures of craniofacial shape and size recorded in ALSPAC (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). We used these data to test for association between the top SNPs at genome-wide significance and each of the 54 measures of craniofacial development. Because of the large number of correlated craniofacial phenotypes analysed, and consequently the large number of statistical tests performed, we calculated empirical P-values for each SNP permuting each genotype against the 54 phenotypes. This procedure is less conservative than a Bonferroni correction (which assumes that the phenotypes are independent) and ensures that the correlation between phenotypes is properly accounted for in the multiple testing correction. Empirical P-values were calculated for each SNP and those with P < 0.05 were declared significant (Table 2). Using this procedure, we identified three SNPs, which were associated with 10 of the 54 craniofacial measures. Specifically, the SNP rs17101923 (HMGA2) was associated with measurements indexing the width of the upper region of the face and nose (Table 2 and Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Alleles that were associated with increased face width were associated with increased number of teeth and earlier tooth eruption. The rs7924176 marker (ADK) was also associated with measures indexing the width of the nose. Alleles that predisposed to earlier tooth eruption were also associated with a wider nose. Furthermore, rs997154 (AJUBA) was associated with an increase in height and prominence of the mid-brow. \n\nWe also looked up the top SNP from each of the 15 genome-wide significant loci in a previous analysis of secondary dentition and found that 7 were at least nominally associated (P < 0.05) with the number of permanent teeth between 6 and 14 years old (Supplementary Material, Table S4). For the three loci (i.e. HMGA2, BMP4, MSRB3) associated with ‘age at first tooth’ at genome-wide significance, the allele associated with earlier primary tooth eruption was also associated with a greater number of permanent teeth. Furthermore at the four loci (ADK/VCL/AP3M1, 2q35, CACNB2, 6q21) associated with ‘number of primary teeth’, the allele associated with a greater number of teeth at 1 year was also the allele associated with greater number of permanent teeth (6–14 years).\n\nIn order to explore the connection between known height-associated SNPs and teeth phenotypes more deeply, we took 180 robustly associated height variants from the Lango Allen et al. Giant Consortium meta-analysis and examined the degree to which these SNPs were associated with tooth eruption (Supplementary Material, Table S5). Several height-associated SNPs showed strong evidence of association with tooth eruption in the expected direction (i.e. the height increaser allele was associated with faster tooth eruption/more teeth), including rs1351394 in HMGA2 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 5.3 × 10−7; ‘Number of teeth’: P = 1.0 × 10−9), rs12534093 in IGF2BP3 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 0.0026; ‘Number of teeth’: P = 2.7 × 10−5), rs1490384 near C6orf173 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 1.0 × 10−7; ‘Number of teeth’: P = 0.12) and rs1570106 in RAD51L1 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 0.00012; ‘Number of teeth’: 2.3 × 10−6). Overall, however, the number of height-associated SNPs for which the height increaser allele had a positive effect on faster tooth eruption was not greater than expected by chance (‘Age at first tooth’: 89/180 SNPs in the expected direction P = 0.94; ‘Number of teeth’: 92/180 SNPs in the expected direction P = 0.71). Likewise, a weighted allelic score of height-associated SNPs did not significantly predict the age at first tooth or the number of teeth (‘Age at first tooth’: PMETA = 0.18; ‘Number of teeth’: PMETA = 0.44).\n\nWe also regressed height at 17 years in ALSPAC and at 31 years in NFBC1966 on an allelic score constructed from the genome-wide significant SNPs for ‘Age at first tooth’ and ‘Number of teeth’ listed in Table 1. Allelic scores for ‘Age at first tooth’ (PMETA = 0.0012) and ‘Number of teeth’ (PMETA = 9.8 × 10−4) showed moderate evidence of association with height; however, the associations appeared to be driven largely by variants in HMGA2 and BMP4. After these SNPS were removed from the construction of the scores, the evidence for association attenuated markedly (‘Age at first tooth’ PMETA = 0.11; ‘Number of teeth’ PMETA = 0.04).\n\nFinally, we conducted a pathway analysis using the ALLIGATOR software. In the pathway analyses, an SNP association P-value threshold of 0.005 gave the most significant over-representation of genes in pathways in the ‘age at first tooth’ GWAS (see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Material, Table S6a). The top 20 pathways (of the 2276 considered) from this analysis are shown in Table 3; 11 of these pathways had pathway association P-values <0.001 and the P-value associated with this degree of overrepresentation is 0.004 (Supplementary Material, Table S6A). However, none of the association P-value thresholds applied to the ‘number of teeth’ GWAS resulted in a significant over-representation of pathways (Supplementary Material, Table S6B). In Discussion, we focus on the results from the ‘age at first tooth’ GWAS."
