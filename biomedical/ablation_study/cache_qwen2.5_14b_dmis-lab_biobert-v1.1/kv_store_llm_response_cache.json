The minor allele frequency (MAF; A allele) was 0.402 in the total population. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline BMI, and diet groups, no main effects of the FTO rs1558902 genotype on changes in weight or WC were found at 6 months and 2 years. However, a significant association was observed with greater weight loss in the high-protein group (P = 0.010) by the end of intervention (2 years). Additionally, the risk allele (A) was associated with greater loss of total fat, FFM, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat at 2 years in the high-protein group but not in the low-protein group.\n\nWe found that changes in body composition and fat distribution were significantly influenced by interactions between the FTO rs1558902 genotype and dietary protein intake. The results showed significant gene-diet interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat (for interactions, P = 0.034 and 0.049) adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, carbohydrate, baseline BMI, and the baseline value of body composition.\n\nThe FTO rs1558902 genotype influences physiological processes related to weight loss, body composition changes, and fat distribution in response to different dietary patterns, particularly high-protein diets. The analysis also revealed significant interactions between genetic factors (FTO variant) and environmental factors (dietary protein intake).\n\nIn summary, the FTO rs1558902 genotype interacts with high-protein diets to modulate physiological processes such as weight loss, body composition changes, and fat distribution.\n\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>\"FTO Gene\"<|>\"Gene\"<|>\"The FTO gene encodes a protein that is associated with the regulation of energy balance and obesity risk.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"MAF is a measure used to describe genetic variation within a population, indicating the proportion of a specific allele in the gene pool.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"A Allele (Risk Allele)\"<|>\"Genomic Variant\"<|>\"The A allele at the rs1558902 locus is considered a risk allele for obesity and weight gain due to its influence on energy balance.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Baseline BMI\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) represents an individual's initial body mass index before intervention, used as a reference point in clinical trials.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Total Fat Loss\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Total fat loss involves the physiological process of reducing overall adipose tissue mass within the body.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Fat-Free Mass (FFM) Loss\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Loss in fat-free mass refers to a decrease in muscle and other non-fat tissues, which can be influenced by dietary protein intake and genetic factors like FTO rs1558902 genotype.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"FM% (Fat Mass Percentage)\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"The percentage of body fat relative to total weight, affected by dietary interventions and genetic predispositions such as the FTO gene variant.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Trunk Fat Loss\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Loss of trunk fat is a reduction in adipose tissue localized around the torso area, influenced by diet and genetics.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) Changes\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Changes in visceral adipose tissue refer to alterations in intra-abdominal fat deposits that affect health outcomes such as metabolic syndrome.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT) Changes\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Alterations in subcutaneous adipose tissue involve changes in superficial body fat deposits which are influenced by dietary and genetic factors.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Gene-Diet Interaction Analysis\"<|>\"Molecular Interaction\"<|>\"An analysis method used to study the interaction between genetic variants (such as FTO rs1558902) and environmental factors (dietary protein intake), impacting physiological processes like weight loss and body composition changes.\")##\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"FTO Gene\"<|>\"Baseline BMI\"<|>\"The baseline BMI provides a reference for measuring the impact of genetic variants such as those in the FTO gene on body mass over time.\"<|>2)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"A Allele (Risk Allele)\"<|>\"High-Protein Diet\"<|>\"Individuals carrying the A allele show greater weight loss and changes in body composition when consuming a high-protein diet compared to non-carriers.\"<|>4)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"Total Fat Loss\"<|>\"Fat-Free Mass Loss\"<|>\"Changes in total fat are often accompanied by corresponding losses or gains in fat-free mass, indicating an overall shift in body composition.\"<|>2)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"Baseline BMI\"<|>\"FM%\"<|>\"The initial FM% provides context for how genetic factors and dietary interventions can influence the percentage of body fat over time.\"<|>2)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"Trunk Fat Loss\"<|>\"Total Fat Loss\"<|>\"Loss in trunk fat is a component of total fat loss, reflecting changes in central adiposity due to dietary and genetic influences.\"<|>3)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"Gene-Diet Interaction Analysis\"<|>\"Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) Changes\"<|>\"Analysis reveals that gene-diet interactions significantly impact changes in visceral adipose tissue, particularly in response to high-protein diets.\"<|>4)<|COMPLETE|>",
