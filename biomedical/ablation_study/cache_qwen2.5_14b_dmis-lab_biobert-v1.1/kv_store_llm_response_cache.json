The minor allele frequency (MAF; A allele) was 0.402 in the total population. After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline BMI, and diet groups, no main effects of the FTO rs1558902 genotype on changes in weight or WC were found at 6 months and 2 years. However, a significant association was observed with greater weight loss in the high-protein group (P = 0.010) by the end of intervention (2 years). Additionally, the risk allele (A) was associated with greater loss of total fat, FFM, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat at 2 years in the high-protein group but not in the low-protein group.\n\nWe found that changes in body composition and fat distribution were significantly influenced by interactions between the FTO rs1558902 genotype and dietary protein intake. The results showed significant gene-diet interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat (for interactions, P = 0.034 and 0.049) adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, carbohydrate, baseline BMI, and the baseline value of body composition.\n\nThe FTO rs1558902 genotype influences physiological processes related to weight loss, body composition changes, and fat distribution in response to different dietary patterns, particularly high-protein diets. The analysis also revealed significant interactions between genetic factors (FTO variant) and environmental factors (dietary protein intake).\n\nIn summary, the FTO rs1558902 genotype interacts with high-protein diets to modulate physiological processes such as weight loss, body composition changes, and fat distribution.\n\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>\"FTO Gene\"<|>\"Gene\"<|>\"The FTO gene encodes a protein that is associated with the regulation of energy balance and obesity risk.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"MAF is a measure used to describe genetic variation within a population, indicating the proportion of a specific allele in the gene pool.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"A Allele (Risk Allele)\"<|>\"Genomic Variant\"<|>\"The A allele at the rs1558902 locus is considered a risk allele for obesity and weight gain due to its influence on energy balance.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Baseline BMI\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) represents an individual's initial body mass index before intervention, used as a reference point in clinical trials.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Total Fat Loss\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Total fat loss involves the physiological process of reducing overall adipose tissue mass within the body.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Fat-Free Mass (FFM) Loss\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Loss in fat-free mass refers to a decrease in muscle and other non-fat tissues, which can be influenced by dietary protein intake and genetic factors like FTO rs1558902 genotype.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"FM% (Fat Mass Percentage)\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"The percentage of body fat relative to total weight, affected by dietary interventions and genetic predispositions such as the FTO gene variant.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Trunk Fat Loss\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Loss of trunk fat is a reduction in adipose tissue localized around the torso area, influenced by diet and genetics.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) Changes\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Changes in visceral adipose tissue refer to alterations in intra-abdominal fat deposits that affect health outcomes such as metabolic syndrome.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT) Changes\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"Alterations in subcutaneous adipose tissue involve changes in superficial body fat deposits which are influenced by dietary and genetic factors.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Gene-Diet Interaction Analysis\"<|>\"Molecular Interaction\"<|>\"An analysis method used to study the interaction between genetic variants (such as FTO rs1558902) and environmental factors (dietary protein intake), impacting physiological processes like weight loss and body composition changes.\")##\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"FTO Gene\"<|>\"Baseline BMI\"<|>\"The baseline BMI provides a reference for measuring the impact of genetic variants such as those in the FTO gene on body mass over time.\"<|>2)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"A Allele (Risk Allele)\"<|>\"High-Protein Diet\"<|>\"Individuals carrying the A allele show greater weight loss and changes in body composition when consuming a high-protein diet compared to non-carriers.\"<|>4)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"Total Fat Loss\"<|>\"Fat-Free Mass Loss\"<|>\"Changes in total fat are often accompanied by corresponding losses or gains in fat-free mass, indicating an overall shift in body composition.\"<|>2)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"Baseline BMI\"<|>\"FM%\"<|>\"The initial FM% provides context for how genetic factors and dietary interventions can influence the percentage of body fat over time.\"<|>2)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"Trunk Fat Loss\"<|>\"Total Fat Loss\"<|>\"Loss in trunk fat is a component of total fat loss, reflecting changes in central adiposity due to dietary and genetic influences.\"<|>3)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"Gene-Diet Interaction Analysis\"<|>\"Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) Changes\"<|>\"Analysis reveals that gene-diet interactions significantly impact changes in visceral adipose tissue, particularly in response to high-protein diets.\"<|>4)<|COMPLETE|>",

This decreased to 13% for S-FOL and 16% for WB-FOL with the use of CDC reagents. Overall, when all laboratories used IH reagents, the mean ± SD difference to the CDC MBA target value decreased from 22% ± 20% for S-FOL and 25% ± 19% for WB-FOL to 12% ± 12% for S-FOL and 13% ± 13% for WB-FOL with the use of CDC reagents.

Furthermore, with the harmonized condition it can be expected that the differences between 2 days of analysis would be approximately ±10–30% for S-FOL and approximately ±20–40% for WB-FOL (Figure 4B).

a repetitive pattern in the previous response, which caused redundancy. Let's break down the key points more clearly:\n\n### Key Entities:\n1. **PTPN2:rs478582** - A genetic variant (SNP) associated with increased susceptibility to MAPbacteremia.\n2. **GA Alleles** - Heterozygous or minor alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601, linked to MAPbacteremia presence.\n3. **AA Allele** - Minor allele in PTPN22:rs2476601 with reduced association to MAPbacteremia.\n4. **C-G Haplotype** - A genetic combination associated with increased MAPbacteremia susceptibility.\n5. **T-A Haplotype** - Moderate increase in MAPbacteremia presence due to this haplotype.\n6. **C-A Haplotype** - Similar moderate increase in MAPbacteremia presence.\n7. **MAPbacteremia** - A disease characterized by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) bacteria presence.\n\n### Key Relationships:\n1. **PTPN2 Gene Expression and Healthy Controls without MAPbacteremia Presence:**\n   - Healthy controls exhibit higher PTPN2 gene expression levels compared to Crohn's Disease (CD) subjects.\n   \n2. **IFN-γ Gene Expression with Combined Presence of MAPbacteremia and Specific SNPs:**\n   - Increased IFN-γ expression in subjects having both MAPbacteremia and specific genetic variants like GA alleles, C-G haplotype, etc.\n\n3. **PTPN2 Gene Expression and CD Subjects with MAPbacteremia Presence:**\n   - PTPN2 gene expression is lower in CD subjects compared to healthy controls when MAPbacteremia is present.\n\n### Summary:\n- Genetic variants (SNPs and haplotypes) influence the susceptibility to MAPbacteremia.\n- The presence of these genetic markers impacts IFN-γ and PTPN2 gene expressions differently in health versus disease states.\n- Specifically, individuals with certain genotypes exhibit higher or lower expression levels of relevant genes compared to those without such variants.\n\nThis concise breakdown should help clarify the key relationships and entities involved in understanding how MAPbacteremia interacts with genetic markers and immune responses.

Compared with a single dose of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells, repeat dosing over the course of 1 month demonstrated more durable anti-tumor responses in the OV90 model (Figures 4B,C). When plotted as relative tumor growth kinetics, repeat dosing promoted more extensive tumor regression as well as more durable control of tumors compared with single dosing (Figure 4D).\n\nIn this study, the overall survival was extended significantly in mice that received repeat doses of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (55 day benefit) compared with a single dose (30 day benefit) (Figure 4E). Greater T cell numbers were observed in peritoneal tumors of mice with repeat treatment (Figure 4F). Importantly, however, we observed reduced numbers, expansion and persistence of CAR T cells in the blood of OV90-bearing mice, compared with the OVCAR3 model (Supplemental Figures 8A,B), suggesting that this more aggressive tumor model may also harbor suppressive mechanisms that hamper T cell function and overall CAR T cell efficacy. Collectively, these data demonstrate potent anti-tumor activity of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in ovarian cancer xenograft models, and also suggest that repeat dosing of regionally delivered CAR T cells may provide greater control of tumors compared with a single dose.\n\nTumor recurrences following TAG72-CAR T cell therapy show antigen escape\n\nOne of the major resistance mechanisms to CAR T cell therapy is the tumor antigen heterogeneity that exists in solid tumors that promotes eventual antigen loss or escape. While the loss of CAR T cells in our two models preceded tumor recurrences, we next evaluated expression of TAG72 in tumors from Mock and TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treated mice at various time points pre- and post- therapy. Since TAG72, MUC1, and MUC16 have all been identified as potential targets in ovarian cancer, we first assessed expression of these cell surface antigens on TAG72-negative OVCAR8, and TAG72-positive OVCAR3 and OV90 cells. OVCAR8 appeared to only express low levels of MUC1, and was absent for TAG72 and MUC16, while OVCAR3 expressed all three antigens at varying levels, and OV90 showed low expression of MUC1 and was absent for MUC16 (Figure 5A). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of these antigens in OVCAR3 tumors from mice treated with Mock or TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells. At 12 weeks post T cell infusion, tumors from Mock-treated mice showed heterogeneous expression of TAG72 (similar to flow cytometric analysis of the cell line), MUC16, and MUC1 (Figure 5B). However, tumor recurrences at early time points from mice treated with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells showed a dramatic reduction in TAG72 expression, while maintaining expression of MUC16 and MUC1. Similarly, repeat treatment of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in the OV90 tumor model also showed a reduction in TAG72 expression in early recurrent tumors following treatment (Figure 5C). Interestingly, the expression of TAG72 was detected at high levels in tumor recurrences at later time points, in solid tumors as well as in ascites (Figures 5C,D). We further confirmed this finding in vitro, showing that residual viable OVCAR3 tumor cells remaining after CAR T cell co-culture expressed lower TAG72, but showed typical TAG72 expression levels on tumor cells that grew out in the absence of CAR T cells (Figure 5E). Similar reductions in TAG72 expression were observed with OV90 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that antigen escape plays a key role in tumor recurrences following TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell therapy.\n\n######################\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>\"TAG72-BBζ CAR T Cells\"<|>\"Protein\"<|>\"CAR T cells targeting the TAG72 antigen, which are used to treat ovarian cancer.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Ovarian Cancer Xenograft Models\"<|>\"Disease\"<|>\"Experimental models of ovarian cancer used for testing therapeutic interventions like CAR T cell therapy.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"TAG72 Antigen\"<|>\"Gene\"<|>\"A gene encoding an antigen expressed on the surface of some ovarian cancer cells, targeted by CAR T cells in this study.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Tumor Recurrence\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"The process where tumors regrow after initial treatment response.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"MUC1 Antigen\"<|>\"Gene\"<|>\"A gene encoding another cell surface antigen expressed on some ovarian cancer cells, involved in tumor heterogeneity and escape mechanisms.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"MUC16 Antigen\"<|>\"Gene\"<|>\"Another gene coding for an antigen found on the surface of certain ovarian cancer cells, related to therapeutic targeting strategies.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"CAR T Cell Therapy\"<|>\"Therapy\"<|>\"A form of immunotherapy where T cells are engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that targets specific antigens expressed by tumor cells.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"Tumor Heterogeneity\"<|>\"Physiological Process\"<|>\"The presence of genetic and phenotypic diversity within tumors, contributing to resistance against targeted therapies.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"OVCAR8 Cells\"<|>\"Cell Line\"<|>\"A cell line derived from ovarian cancer cells that expresses low levels of MUC1 but lacks TAG72 and MUC16 expression.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"OVCAR3 Tumors\"<|>\"Disease\"<|>\"Experimental tumors derived from OVCAR3 cells, used to study the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in ovarian cancer models.\")## (\"entity\"<|>\"OV90 Tumor Model\"<|>\"Cell Line\"<|>\"A model system using OV90 cells to evaluate the impact of CAR T cell therapy on tumor growth and recurrence.\")\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>\"TAG72-BBζ CAR T Cells\"<|>\"Ovarian Cancer Xenograft Models\"<|>\"CAR T cells are used in xenograft models to study their efficacy against ovarian cancer.\" <|>4)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"TAG72 Antigen\"<|>\"MUC1 Antigen\"<|>\"Both TAG72 and MUC1 antigens play roles in ovarian cancer, showing heterogeneity and potential escape mechanisms following CAR T cell therapy.\" <|>3)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"TAG72-BBζ CAR T Cells\"<|>\"Tumor Recurrence\"<|>\"CAR T cells targeting the TAG72 antigen can lead to tumor recurrence through antigen escape mechanisms.\" <|>2)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"MUC1 Antigen\"<|>\"Ovarian Cancer Xenograft Models\"<|>\"Expression and study of MUC1 in xenograft models contribute to understanding resistance mechanisms in ovarian cancer treatment.\" <|>3)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"CAR T Cell Therapy\"<|>\"Tumor Heterogeneity\"<|>\"Resistance to CAR T cell therapy can be driven by the genetic diversity within tumors, leading to antigen escape and recurrence.\" <|>2)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"OVCAR8 Cells\"<|>\"MUC1 Antigen\"<|>\"The OVCAR8 cell line is used to study MUC1 expression patterns in ovarian cancer cells, which contributes to understanding resistance mechanisms.\" <|>3)## (\"relationship\"<|>\"OV90 Tumor Model\"<|>\"TAG72-BBζ CAR T Cells\"<|>\"The OV90 tumor model demonstrates the impact of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells on tumor growth and recurrence over time, indicating potential escape mechanisms.\" <|>4)<|COMPLETE|>\n\nThis additional extraction includes more entities and relationships based on the text provided.",
