General and Demographic Characteristics of the Participants According to Gender and Obesity\n\nThe men were older than the women, while the obese women were older than the nonobese women (p < 0.001). Obese women were shorter than nonobese women, but there was no height difference linked to obesity in men (p < 0.001). The average BMIs of the nonobese and obese groups were approximately 22.5 and 27.1 kg/m2, respectively, in both gender groups (Table 1). The waist circumferences were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, but men in the obese and nonobese groups had greater waist circumferences than women in the corresponding weight groups. Interestingly, the skeletal muscle and fat mass were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group for both genders (p < 0.05; Table 1). On the other hand, the adjusted ORs were much higher for waist circumferences (OR = 18.3 and 95% CI: 16.5–20.3) and fat mass (OR = 20.71 and 95% CI = 17.83–24.16) for obesity risk than the skeletal muscle mass. The initial menstrual age was younger in the obese group than in the nonobese group, while there was no significant difference in menopausal age in the obese and nonobese groups (Table 1).\n\nThe incidence of metabolic syndrome was much higher in the obese groups in both genders, and the risk of metabolic syndrome increased 5.86-fold in the obese group (p < 0.001; Table 1). The components of metabolic syndrome were higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders. Serum total cholesterol and LDL concentrations were much higher in women than men, but the serum triglyceride concentrations were higher in men than women (Table 1). The serum HDL concentrations were higher in women than men. In the combined lipid profiles, women had as many lipid disturbances as men. Furthermore, obese women exhibited higher serum hs-CRP concentrations than nonobese women, but this was not observed in men (Table 1). Blood pressure, including systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), was higher in the obese group than the nonobese group, and men showed higher blood pressure than women. Women had much higher eGFR than men, and eGFR was lower in the obese group than in the nonobese group. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations were higher in the obese groups than the nonobese groups in both genders. Obesity increased the odds ratio for higher AST and ALT concentrations by 2.0 and 2.7-fold, respectively (Table 1). \n\n3.2. Lifestyle Characteristics of the Participants According to Genders and Obesity\n\nThe daily energy intake based on the estimated energy intake was higher in the obese groups than the nonobese group in both genders, and it increased the obesity risk by 1.24-fold. The protein intake also elevated the obesity risk (p < 0.05; Table 2) based on the daily energy intake. In women, the carbohydrate intake was higher in the obesity group than the nonobese group, and the association of the carbohydrate intake with the obesity risk was marginally significant (p = 0.0508). Fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and cholesterol intake, were not associated with the obesity risk (Table 2). Their intake was slightly higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in men, but their intakes showed an opposite tendency in women. DII was similar in the obese and nonobese groups, but DII was higher in men than women (Table 2). Interestingly, the fried-food intake was higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, but the intake of sugar-containing foods was higher in the nonobese groups than the obese group in women, but not men (Table 2). Obese men had a higher intake of a Korean balanced diet and Western-style diet than the nonobese men, while there was no difference in the plant-based diet and rice-based diet intake in obese and nonobese men (Table 2). Obese women had a lower plant-based diet and a higher Korean balanced diet than nonobese women. There was no significant association of dietary patterns with obesity risk (Table 2).\n\nAlcohol intake was much higher in the obese group than the nonobese group in both genders, particularly in men (Table 2). Alcohol intake was positively associated with the obesity risk. Fewer current smokers belonged to the obese group than the nonobese group in men but not women (Table 2). Regular exercise lowered the incidence of obesity in women but not men. Regular exercise was inversely associated with the risk of obesity (Table 2). \n\n3.3. Genetic Variants Related to the Obesity Risk and the Best Model with SNP-SNP Interaction\n\nTen genes with SNPs that affect the obesity risk were chosen to examine genetic variant−genetic variant interactions in the GMDR in the urban hospital-based cohort (Table 3). The selected genetic variants involved in the obesity risk were SEC16 Homolog B (SEC16B, endoplasmic reticulum export factor) rs543874, DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C27 (DNAJC27)_rs713586, CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1)_rs9356744, transcription factor AP-2 Beta (TFAP2B)_rs2206277, BDNF_rs6265, myosin light chain-2 (MYL2)_rs3782889, olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4)_rs9568856, FTO_rs1421085, MC4R_rs6567160, and GIPR_rs1444988703 (Table 3). These genes were strongly connected, and FTO and MC4R acted as hub genes that affect the risk of obesity. All of the genes were involved in either energy intake or energy expenditure by modulating transcription factors. These SNPs satisfied the MAF (>0.01) and HWE (p > 0.05) criteria (Table 2). Some SNPs had an inverse association with obesity risk, while the other SNPs were positively associated with the obesity risk. The p values of most selected SNPs were higher than 5×10−7, but rs3782889_MYL2 and rs9356744_CDKAL1 did not meet the statistical criteria (Table 3). These SNPs had similar associations with the obesity risk, and the statistical significance was higher in the Ansan/Ansung cohort (Table 3), but they were not ultimately included in the best model.\n\nAmong the genetic variants selected, the models including 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 SNPs met the criteria of TREB and CVC for the best model to explain the SNP−SNP interactions that contribute to obesity risk. The five models exhibited significant interactions among the genetic variants that influenced the obesity risk (Table 4). The 5-SNP model included SEC16B_rs543874, DNAJC27_rs713586, BDNF_rs6265, MC4R_rs6567160, and GIPR_rs1444988703. The genetic variants in model 5 plus CDKAL1_rs9356744 and OLFM4_rs9568856 (model 7) also exhibited significant interactions (Table 4). The models that added the remainder of the SNPs to model 7 also had significant interactions for obesity risk. After adjusting for covariates, the models included five, seven, eight, nine, and ten genetic variants that met the TRBA, TEBA, and CVC criteria, including gender, age, resident area, regular exercise, and smoking status. However, since all of these models have similar statistical significance; therefore model 5, which included the smallest number of variables, was selected.\n\nModel 5 resulted in participants having PRS scores ranging from 0–9 risk alleles. The results show that BMI showed an increasing trend with PRS, and the participants with PRS scores of 8 and 9 had a sharp increment in BMI (Figure 2A). Although there was a positive association between PRS and BMI, some severely obese and underweight participants were distributed among the top deciles of PRS (8 and 9) to the bottom decile (0). However, obese (25–30 kg/m2) and severely obese (>30 kg/m2) persons had much higher representations in the middle deciles (2–7) than normal (18.5–23 kg/m2 for men and 18.5–22 kg/m2 for women), overweight (23–25 kg/m2 for men and 22–25 kg/m2 for women), and underweight (Figure 2B). In the other stratification, participants were assigned to low PRS (0–3), medium PRS (4–5), and high PRS (≥6) (Figure 2C). The PRS stratification showed a similar pattern of the top, middle, and bottom deciles, but the percentage of overweight participants in the three PRS groups was not significantly different.\n\nThe high PRS of the 5-SNP model was positively associated with the obesity risk: by 1.626 (1.474–1.801) and 1.629 (1.475–1.798) times after adjusting for covariates 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 2D). The high PRS with seven SNPs also showed a positive association with the obesity risk, but the ORs of the 7-SNP model were slightly smaller than those in the 5-SNP model (Figure 2D).\n\nThe PRS was significantly associated with the BMI: 1.43-fold and 1.55-fold in men and women, respectively, after adjusting for the covariates (Table 5). On the other hand, PRS was not related to waist circumference and SMI after adjusting for the covariates, including BMI. Interestingly, the fat mass was positively associated with fat by 1.46-fold only in men but not women after adjusting for covariates, including the BMI (Table 5). In addition, PRS was not related to menarche and menopausal age in women after adjusting for the covariates. \n\n3.4. Interaction of PRS and Nutrient Intake in Obesity Risk\n\nInterestingly, initial menstruation age interacted with PRS for the obesity risk. In participants with an early menarche age, the BMI was higher than those with late menarche age. The impact of PRS was much higher in the participants with early menstruation than those with late menstruation (p = 0.027; Figure 3A). The adjusted ORs and 95% CI were 2.38 and 1.608–2.841 in the participants with early menstruation and 1.562 and 1.405–1.738 in those with late menstruation, respectively (Table 6).\n\nA plant-based diet intake showed an interaction with the PRS to influence the obesity risk (Table 6). In a low plant-based diet intake, the genetic impact was lower for BMI, whereas the participants with a high PRS had a higher BMI than those with a low PRS with a high plant-based dietary intake (Figure 3B). Adults with a high PRS were protected against the obesity risk in a high plant-based diet (Table 6). The nutrient intake and other dietary patterns did not show any interactions with the PRS to affect the obesity risk.\n\nFried-food intake exhibited an interaction with the PRS (Table 6). The high fried-food intake participants had a higher BMI, but the PRS impact was offset in the participants with a high fried-food intake (Figure 3C). Thus, fried-food intake should be avoided to protect against obesity, even though a high PRS did not significantly exacerbate the obesogenic effects of fried-food intake (p = 0.035)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nCharacteristics of study population.\n\nBaseline characteristics of participants according to the FTO rs1558902 genotype are presented in Table 1. The minor allele frequency (MAF; A allele) was 0.402 in the total population. The genotype frequencies were significantly different among the sexes and ethnicities. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, all variables such as weight, BMI, WC, body composition, and fat distribution had no association with genotype at baseline. Baseline characteristics were similar among participants in the four diet groups (Supplementary Table 1). Likewise, no associations between the FTO genotypes and these measures were observed in the white participants (data not shown).\n\nEffects of FTO rs1558902 genotype on weight and waist: overall and two-factorial analysis.\n\nAfter adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline BMI, and diet groups, no main effects of the FTO rs1558902 genotype on changes in weight or WC were found in any participants at 6 months and 2 years (data not shown). We next examined the genetic effects on changes in weight and WC following a two-factorial design: low versus high fat and low versus high protein. We found that the risk allele (A) was significantly associated with a 1.51-kg greater weight loss in the high-protein group (P = 0.010), but not in the low-protein group, by the end of intervention (2 years). The changes in weight and WC were less significant at 6 months (Table 2). In subgroups treated by different proportions of dietary fat, we did not find significant genetic effects on changes in weight and WC (all P > 0.05; Supplementary Table 2).Similarly, in the white participants, we found the risk allele was associated with a 1.38-kg greater weight loss in the high-protein group at 2 years (P = 0.028), but not in other subgroups (data not shown).\n\nThe FTO rs1558902 genotype and changes in body composition by diet intervention.\n\nConsistent with the observations of change in body weight, we found that the rs15589002 risk allele (A) was associated with greater loss of total fat, FFM, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat at 2 years in the high-protein group, but not in the low-protein group (Table 2). Tests for genotype-diet protein interaction were significant on changes in FFM and FM% (for interactions, P = 0.034 and 0.049, respectively) adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, carbohydrate, baseline BMI, and the baseline value of body composition (Fig. 1). At 6 months, we only observed gene by protein diet interaction on changes in FFM (P = 0.008 for interaction; Fig. 1). The risk allele carriers in the high-protein group had greater loss of FFM than noncarriers, but those in the low-protein group had less loss of FFM compared with noncarriers (Table 2).\n\nWe did not find significant genetic effect and interactions between the FTO variant and dietary fat intake on changes in body composition in total participants (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The results in the white participants were similar (data not shown).\n\nThe FTO rs1558902 genotype and changes in fat distribution by diet intervention.\n\nWe further analyzed body fat distribution measured by CT. At 2 years, we found significant interactions between the FTO rs1558902 genotype and protein diet intervention on changes in TAT, VAT, and SAT (for interactions, P = 0.001, 0.012, and 0.002, respectively; Fig. 2). The risk allele (A) was associated with greater loss of TAT and VAT in the high-protein group but with less loss of TAT and SAT in the low-protein group (Table 2). At 6 months, gene-protein interactions were observed on changes in TAT and SAT (for interactions, P = 0.026 and 0.050, respectively; Fig. 2), and the risk allele carriers in the high-protein group had greater loss of TAT and VAT than noncarriers, but those in the low-protein group had less loss of SAT than noncarriers (Table 2).\n\nWe did not find significant genetic effects and interactions on changes in fat distribution in subgroups treated by different dietary fat components (all P > 0.05; Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2).Similar results were found in the white participants (data not shown).\n\nThe trajectory of changes in body composition and fat distribution by FTO rs1558902 in response to protein diet.\n\nIn a secondary analysis, we used linear mixed models to assess the genotype by time effect over the 2-year trial in those treated by the four dietary compositions. We observed significant genotype-time interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat in response to the high-protein diet. When assigned to the high-protein diet, participants who carried the AA genotype had greater loss in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat than those without this genotype. No genotype-time interaction on changes in body composition was found in the low-protein group (Fig. 3).\n\nWe also observed significant genotype-time interactions on changes in fat distribution in response to the low- and high-protein diets. Participants with the AA genotype had greater decrease in fat distribution in response to the high-protein diet compared with those without this genotype. In contrast, participants with the AA genotype were associated with less loss in TAT and SAT in response to the low-protein diet (Fig. 4).\n\nWe found genotype-time interactions on changes in total fat, FM%, and percentage of trunk fat in response to the low-fat diet (Supplementary Fig. 3), but no genotype-time interactions on changes in fat distribution were found in response to the low- or high-fat diets (Supplementary Fig. 4).A similar trend was observed in the white population (data not shown)."

    "content": "Results\n\nAssociation between the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism and anthropometric variables\n\nGeneral characteristics of the study subjects are shown in Table 1. GP subjects had a mean age 41.2±13.8 y and BMI of 26.0±4.7 kg/m2 (prevalence of obesity was 17.7%). The mean age of OHP was slightly higher (46.3±14.7 y) with a very high mean BMI (41.8±8.4 kg/m2). The educational level of OHP was lower than that of the GP. In elderly HCR subjects mean BMI was 30.1±4.0 kg/m2, with a high prevalence of obesity (49.1%) and lower educational level than the GP.\n\nWe observed (Table 2) that the FTO SNP was strongly associated with greater weight, BMI and waist circumference in the GP. This association followed a co-dominant model, BMI increasing by +0.5 (SE: 0.2) units per risk-allele (P = 0.009). A greater prevalence of obesity was also observed when A-allele carriers were grouped and compared with TT subjects (P = 0.038). These results maintained statistical significant following adjustment for sex, age, smoking and diabetes. In OHP, the association of the FTO SNP with anthropometric measurements was recessive. No differences were observed between the TT and TA subjects, the presence of two A-alleles being necessary in order to observe higher differences in means. In HCR subjects no significant differences in means of weight, BMI and waist circumference depending on the FTO SNP were observed. Neither was any association with the prevalence of obesity found. The statistical significance of results did not change after multivariate adjustment for sex, age, smoking and diabetes. Further adjustment of these models for PA and education did not change the statistical significance of results.\n\nInteraction between the FTO SNP and education in determining BMI and obesity risk\n\nFirstly, we studied the interaction between educational level expressed in 3-categories and the FTO SNP in determining BMI in the GP (Fig. 1A). The interaction term between the FTO SNP and education did not reach the statistical significance (P = 0.152) when 3-categories of educational level were considered. Thus, in the stratified analysis by educational level, we observed that the association between the A-allele and higher BMI in the GP was present in individuals with primary (P = 0.029) and secondary studies (P = 0.028), but not in university level subjects (P = 0.786). Hence, we decided to group primary and secondary studies together and to create a variable with 2-categories: non-university and university studies. This variable presented a statistically significant interaction term with the FTO SNP (P for interaction 0.048) in determining BMI in the GP (Fig. 1B). In OHP, this interaction was also studied, but no AA individuals with university studies were found. OHP were analyzed jointly with the GP, introducing population origin as a covariate in the statistical model. Again, a statistically significant interaction term (P = 0.043) was obtained between the FTO SNP and educational level in determining BMI (Fig. 1C). In the stratified analysis, the FTO SNP was associated with higher BMI in non-university individuals (P < 0.001), but not in university level subjects (P = 0.760). In elderly subjects with HCR (Fig. 1D), no statistically significant interaction of education with the FTO SNP in determining BMI was detected (P for interaction 0.839). The statistical significance of the interactions terms did not change after additional adjustment of the corresponding models for PA. Moreover, we studied the interaction between the FTO SNP and PA on BMI (Supplementary Fig. S1) and did not observe any significant interaction term between PA levels (sedentary versus active) and the FTO SNP in determining BMI in the GP (P = 0.617). However, in HCR subjects, we found a statistically significant interaction term (P = 0.045) when we considered the first tertile of PA (sedentary) versus the others. The statistical significance of the interaction terms between education and the FTO SNP did not change after additional adjustment for the interaction between FTO and PA (not shown).\n\nIn terms of obesity, we found a clear inverse association between education and obesity risk in the GP (Table 3). Subjects with university education had a lower obesity risk (OR: 0.37; 95%CI: 0.25–0.54) than did subjects with primary studies. Likewise, AA subjects had a higher obesity risk than TT homozygotes. No significant association was found for TA subjects in the whole population. On analyzing the interaction term between the FTO SNP and education, we found a statistically significant interaction (P for interaction: 0.020) in determining obesity in the GP. In the stratified analysis by educational level in the GP we observed that in individuals without university studies, then FTO SNP was associated with higher obesity risk both in TA (OR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.09–2.23) and in AA subjects (OR: 2.01; 95%CI: 1.27–3.26). However, in individuals with university studies, no significant associations between the FTO SNP and obesity risk were found, and even a change in the direction of the effect associated with the A-allele was detected. In the joint analysis of both the GP and OHP, we also observed a statistically significant interaction term between education and the FTO SNP in determining obesity risk (P for interaction = 0.023). No significant interaction was obtained in the HCR subjects (P = 0.957 for the interaction term between the FTO SNP and education). The statistical significance of these estimations did not change after additional adjustment for PA (not shown)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nOut of 3002 screened publications (Figure 1), 1075 and 107 publications were assessed during abstract and full text screening. Inter‐rater agreement was κ = 0.72 and κ = 0.76 for title and abstract screening, respectively. Overall, 66 eligible publications were identified including 35 publication from cohort studies and 31 from RCTs. Among the publications from cohort studies, 28 investigated G × D, six G × PA, and one combined G × D and G × PA interactions. Among the publications from RCTs, 26 investigated G × L, two G × PA, one combined G × PA and G × D, one combined G × PA and G × L interactions, and one G × D interactions.\n\n Characteristics of the cohort studies \n\nEight publications from cohort studies (Table 1) were published from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) or the Health Professionals Follow‐Up Study (HPFS), six from the Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDCS), five from European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)‐InterAct, three from the Shanghai Diabetes GWAS study, two each from EPIC‐Potsdam, the Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) and the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KOGES), and one each from several other cohort studies. In NHS and HPFS, the study sample was recruited from the health sector staff and included mainly European descendants. In DESIR, volunteers from health facilities were recruited and in all other studies participants from the general population. The sample size of the studies varied between 718 and 99 166, with a mean age of participants greater than 40 years in most studies. The follow‐up time ranged from four to 26 years, with more than 8 years in most studies. Many studies were conducted in populations of only or mainly European ethnicity. Asians were included in the Shanghai Diabetes study, KOGES, and the Korea Association Resource (KARE). \n\nCharacteristics of the RCTs\n\nFifteen publications of RCTs were published from the Finish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS), 14 from the American Diabetes Prevention Project (DPP), one from Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED), and one from a study in Italians from Asti. \n\nIn DPP (Table 2), 3234 participants with IGT and elevated fasting glucose were randomized into an intensive lifestyle‐intervention group and two standard lifestyle groups with administer of metformin or placebo. The lifestyle intervention included individual advices and behavior modification to reduce weight by lower fat and calorie intake and higher PA. In DPS, 522 participants with a high risk for T2D were randomized into a lifestyle‐intervention group or a usual care control group. The lifestyle‐intervention group was individually guided to reduce weight by increasing PA and following a recommended diet. In DPP and DPS, the lifestyle intervention resulted in weight reduction and lower T2D risk. \n\nIn PREDIMED, participants with high cardiovascular risk were randomized into three groups: two Mediterranean‐diet groups with extra‐virgin olive oil (1 L/week) or mixed nuts (30 g/day), and a control group with advice on a low‐fat diet. In the Italian study, 335 participants who were nondiabetic and dysmetabolic were randomized into a lifestyle group which received individualized recommendations by trained professionals to reduce metabolic abnormalities and a control group which received standard, unstructured information.\n\nDietary and PA exposure assessments\n\nThe investigated dietary exposure varied considerably across the publications (Figure 2, Table S6) and included individual food groups (whole grain, red meat, olive oil, dairy, and coffee), macronutrients (fiber, carbohydrate, fat, and protein), micronutrients (magnesium, iron, zinc, and vitamin A), alcohol, glycemic index and glycemic load, and dietary patterns. Dietary factors were assessed in most studies by validated food frequency questionnaire and in some by dietary history records or biomarker measurements. PA (Table S7) was assessed either by in‐person interviews or questionnaires. \n\nStudy quality and risk of bias\n\nThe NOS quality assessment resulted in high and average quality for 30 and five publications of cohort studies (Table S2), respectively. Reasons for point's deduction were mostly inclusion of selective group of volunteers and health stuffs and no statement for completeness of follow‐up.\n\nThe Cochrane risk of bias assessment resulted in low risk of bias for all RCT (Figures S1 and S2). With exception of the performance bias, all judged categories showed low risk of bias. Risk of performance bias was high in all RCT due to the nature of the lifestyle intervention complicating blinding of patient and personal.\n\nThe evaluation of methodological quality (Table S3) resulted in high quality for 26 and medium quality for nine cohort study publications. For the RCTs, 13, 17, and one publications were scored as high, medium, and low quality, respectively. Small sample sizes and missing information about Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium often reduced methodological quality.\n\nMain findings\n\nOf the 66 eligible publications, 19 cohort studies and nine RCT publications reported statistically significant G × E interaction (Figure 2, Tables 3, 4). In addition, some other publications observed significant T2D risk associations in some exposure strata but not in the respective other, although no statistically significant interactions were reported. Potential G × D interaction for genetic variants in the TCF7L2 gene were most frequently investigated, while findings of other genetic variants were often limited to one publication only. Furthermore, publications showed a considerable heterogeneity in investigated dietary factors.\n\nFindings for G × D interaction on incident T2D\n\nInteraction of fiber and whole grain with genetic variants\n\nG × D interactions (Figure 2, Table S6) of TCF7L2 variants have been the most widely studied so far. In particular, the TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 is of interest as it is considered to be strongly associated with T2D risk and known to modify the effect of incretins on insulin secretion. Some publications reported interaction of TCF7L2 variants with fiber and whole‐grain intake on T2D incidence (Figure 2, Table S6). Increased cereal fiber intake in the Stockholm Diabetes Prevention Program (SDPP) and fiber intake in MDCS were associated with lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs7903146 CC‐genotype. Contrary, persons with the rs7903146 risk T‐allele showed a slight trend for increased T2D risk with increasing cereal fiber intake in SDPP and with increasing fiber intake in MDCS. An interaction of whole grain with TCF7L2 rs7903146 was also reported by SDPP and EPIC‐Potsdam. In line with the fiber findings, higher whole‐grain intake was in both studies associated with lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs7903146 CC‐genotype, but not among persons with the risk T‐allele. The TCF7L2 variant rs4506565 also showed interaction with cereal fiber and whole‐grain intake in SDPP and the TCF7L2 variant rs12255372 with fiber intake in MDCS. Contrary, in EPIC‐InterAct and NHS, no interactions of fiber intake with rs7903146 or rs12255372 were observed. \n\nIn MDCS, fiber intake also showed interactions with the variant rs10923931 in the NOTCH2 (involved in WNT activity) and rs4457053 in the ZBED3 (involved in WNT signaling pathway) gene but without replication in another study. Several further variants were investigated in MDCS and in EPIC‐InterAct but none showed an interaction with fiber (Figure 2).\n\nInteraction of carbohydrates and fat with genetic variants\n\nInteraction of carbohydrates and total fat was reported (Figure 2, Table S6) by MDCS with IRS1 rs2943641 (known to increase insulin sensitivity) and with GIPR rs10423928 (known to decrease insulin secretion). However, the IRS1 rs2943641 findings have not been validated in any other study so far, and the GIPR rs10423928 interaction findings could not be replicated in EPIC‐InterAct (12). In NHS, TCF7L2 rs12255372 showed no interaction with carbohydrates, but with glycemic load. A replication of this finding in EPIC‐InterAct failed as well. \n\nPotential interaction of fat with genetic variants was also reported by DESIR but without external replication. In DESIR, a trend for interaction (P = .05) was observed between fat intake and the PPARγ (receptor for fatty acid storage) variants rs1801282 and rs3856806. Furthermore, H‐allele carriers of the FFAR4 variant rs116454156 (involved in Gαq signaling) had a fourfold higher T2D incidence in DESIR than RR‐allele carriers but with low fat intake only. In EPIC‐Potsdam, the CAV2 variant rs2270188 showed an interaction with total fat and saturated fatty acids but a replicate of the CAV2 findings in EPIC‐InterAct failed (12). In addition, no evidence was found in EPIC‐InterAct, NHS, and HPFS for interactions of T2D‐GRSs and IR‐GRS with fat and carbohydrates.\n\nInteraction of alcohol with genetic variants\n\nAn interaction of alcohol with the ADH1C *1/*2 variant (Figure 2, Table S6) was reported by NHS. The ADH1C*2‐allele, which is related to a slower rate of ethanol oxidation, attenuated the lower diabetes risk among alcohol drinking US women. In contrast, such an interaction was not observed among US men. In addition, a T2D gene risk score (GRS) in NHS and HPFS and two HECTD4 variants in KoGES showed no interaction with alcohol.\n\nInteractions of micronutrients with genetic variants\n\nFindings (Figure 2, Table S6) indicate that the association of heme iron with T2D incidence is modified by a GRS of nine T2D associated loci and genetic variants of HFE (homeostatic iron regulator), SLC40A1 (iron‐regulated transporter), and TMPRSS6 gene (transmembrane serine proteinase). In HPFS, US men with high heme iron intake and high adherence to a T2D‐GRS had a higher T2D risk compared with other exposure strata. In NHS, higher heme iron intake was associated with increased T2D risk among women with the haemochromatosis‐associated HFE variants rs1799945 (H63D) or rs1800562 (C282Y). A similar trend was also observed in EPIC‐InterAct for women with the HFE rs1799945 variant, but the corresponding interaction was not significant. Contrary, for men in EPIC‐InterAct, this interaction was significant. In EPIC‐InterAct, heme iron intake showed also interaction with the SLC40A1 rs744653 variant in men and with borderline significance (P = .046) for the TMPRSS6 variant rs855791 in the total sample. In NHS and HPFS, rs855791 showed no interaction. \n\nFor zinc intake, DPP reported an interaction with the SLC30A8 (zinc transporter) variants rs16889462, 8_118252314, and 8_118252435, but without a clear trend for an association with T2D incidence in exposure strata. Investigations of potential interaction of some genetic variants with magnesium intake or vitamin A resulted in nonsignificant findings (Figure 2).\n\nInteractions of individual food with genetic variants\n\nSeveral individual foods have been investigated for potential G × D interaction including red meat, processed meat, olive oil, dairy, and coffee (Figure 2, Table S6). Interactions of red and processed meat with a T2D‐GRS were observed in HPFS. High intake of red and processed meat increased the risk to develop T2D among men with a high GRS, but not among men with a low GRS. Olive oil showed a marginally nonsignificant interaction (P = .05) with the GIPR variant rs10423928 in EPIC‐InterAct.24 \n\nThe association of dairy products with T2D incidence may be modified by the genetic variant rs4988235 near the lactase persistence LCT gene. In a large Danish study, carriers with the lactase persistence LCT rs4988235 T‐allele had higher T2D risk compared with persons with the lactose nonpersistence CC‐genotype when they did not consume milk. A contrasting reduced risk was observed among milk consumers. Coffee intake is hypothesized to reduce T2D risk, and findings from EPIC‐InterAct and KARE indicate that there exist interactions of coffee with some genetic variants. In EPIC‐InterAct, a stronger T2D risk lowering effect with higher coffee intake has been observed for persons with the risk T‐allele of the TCF7L2 variant rs12255372. In KARE, only coffee consumers with the rs4402960 T‐allele (IGF2BP2), rs7754840 G‐allele (CDKAL1), and rs5215 CC‐genotype (KCNJ11) had a reduced combined prediabetes and T2D risk compared with nonconsumer. Besides these findings, several other genetic variants showed no interaction with coffee, olive oil, or dairy products (Figure 2).\n\nInteractions of dietary patterns with genetic variants\n\nEvidence suggests that dietary patterns that reflect Western diet and enhance T2D incidence and those that reflect Mediterranean diet lower T2D incidence. In HPFS (Figure 2, Table S6), a Western dietary pattern was associated to higher T2D risk only among persons with a high T2D‐GRS, but not among persons with a low T2D‐GRS. In PREDIMED, a borderline significant interaction (P = .052) between the CLOCK variant rs4580704 and the Mediterranean diet was observed indicating lower T2D incidence among persons with the rs4580704 G‐allele compared with persons with the CC‐genotype. In EPIC‐InterAct, a Mediterranean‐diet score showed no interaction with a T2D‐GRS. \n\nFindings for G × PA interactions on T2D incidence\n\nSeveral findings indicate that the protective effect of PA on T2D risk is modified by genetic variants (Tables 3 and S7). From the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, it was reported that the association of PA with lower T2D incidence was weaker among persons with high adherence to a T2D‐GRS compared with persons with a low adherence to the T2D‐GRS. In the Swedish Malmö preventive program, the minor HNF1B rs4430796 A‐allele weakened and possibly reversed the protective effect of higher PA on T2D incidence which was observed in persons with the GG‐genotype. In NHS, women with the IRS1 rs1522813 A‐allele and low levels of PA had a higher risk to develop T2D compared with women with the GG‐genotype, but not if they were physically active. \n\nIn DPS, reduced leisure‐time physical activity (LTPA) (Table 3, S8), controlled for weight and diet changes, was associated with higher T2D incidence among persons with the PPARγ rs1801282 Ala‐ and rs17036314 C‐alleles compared with persons with the ProPro‐ and GG‐genotypes. Contrary, an increase of LTPA resulted in lower T2D incidence among persons with the ADRA2B Glu12‐allele, with the ABCC8 rs3758947 GG‐genotype and with the nonrisk haplotype of the four SLC2A2 variants rs5393, rs5394, rs5400, and rs5404, whereas persons with the risk allele seem to be unresponsive to change in LTPA. Several further investigated genetic variants showed no interaction with PA or change in LTPA (Table 3).\n\nFindings for G × L interactions on incident T2D\n\nFindings of DPP and DPS indicate that interaction between weight loss interventions to reduce diabetes risk and genetic variants may modify the risk to develop T2D (Tables 4 and S9). In both studies, participants with the TCF7L2 rs12255372 risk TT‐genotype showed lower T2D incidence in the intervention group than in the control group. Similar findings were reported for persons with the rs7903146 risk T‐allele by DPP and the Asti study. However, the corresponding interaction tests were not significant. \n\nOther genetic variants have been investigated only in one RCT study populations, respectively. In DPP, the weight loss intervention was associated with a reduced T2D incidence among persons with the diabetogenic variant of ENPP1 rs1044498, and a trend for interaction was found for MC4R rs17066829. Reported interaction findings from DPS indicate that the weight loss intervention resulted in a lower T2D incidence among persons with the PPARγ rs1152003 CC‐genotype, the TNFα rs1800629 GG‐genotype, the ADRA2B Glu9‐allele, and the LIPC rs2070895 A‐allele compared with the reference genotypes. Both studies investigated also several further genetic variants, but of them none showed an indication for interaction with weight loss intervention (Table 4)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nStudy samples\n\nClinical characteristics of the study samples are reported in Table 1. The case group in set 1 had more women than the control group. The mean age at enrollment for the T2D-ESRD group was higher (P < 0.05), but the age of onset of T2D in the case subjects was >7 years earlier than the age of enrollment for control subjects. Mean BMI was not significantly different between T2D-ESRD case and nondiabetic control subjects (P = 0.19). Set 2 case subjects also included a higher percentage of women. Mean age at enrollment for the T2D group was higher (P < 0.05); the mean BMI for T2D case subjects was higher than for control subjects (P < 0.05). Overall, the samples have characteristics that reflect the general population of African Americans in the southeast. The mean (SD) African ancestry proportions in the 1,502 T2D-ESRD case subjects, 1,150 T2D case subjects, and 1,393 combined control subjects were 0.79 ± 0.10, 0.78 ± 0.10, and 0.78 ± 0.09, respectively, as estimated by the frequentist estimation of individual ancestry proportion program.\n\nAnalysis of individual index variants\n\nRisk allele frequencies and individual SNP association results are reported in Table 2. When the 2,652 T2D case subjects and 1,393 control subjects were combined, frequencies of risk alleles ranged from 8.64 to 99.97%. Notably, we observed an association of rs7903146 in TCF7L2 (OR 1.38 [95% CI 1.23–1.54], P = 1.25 × 10−8). In addition, rs10010131 in WFS1 (OR 1.13, P = 0.029), rs10946398 in CDKAL1 (OR 1.14, P = 0.014), and rs864745 in JAZF1 (OR 1.20, P = 2.30 × 10−3) were associated with directions of association consistent with prior reports in European-derived samples. SNP rs4607103 in ADAMTS9 was also associated (P = 2.40 × 10−3); however, the direction of association was opposite that reported in a European sample (OR 0.84 in this analysis). Results of an additional analysis adjusting for BMI were comparable (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nSNPs were evaluated in case groups (sets 1 and 2) and subsequently combined in a meta-analysis to determine if associations differed between the overall and individual analyses (Supplementary Table 2). The TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 was associated in sets 1 and 2. In set 1, rs4607103 in ADAMTS9 was associated; however, the effect was in the opposite direction of that reported in a European sample. In set 2, rs10946398 in CDKAL1 was associated, as was rs864745 in JAZF1. In the meta-analysis, results were consistent with the combined analysis (described above) (Table 2); rs10010131 in WFS1, rs10946398 in CDKAL1, rs864745 in JAZF1, and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 replicated association with risk, whereas rs4607103 in ADAMTS9 replicated association in the opposite direction of effect of that previously reported in a European sample.\n\nCumulative risk score\n\nUnweighted and weighted cumulative risk scores were evaluated in the overall cohort. Figure 1A and B show the percentage of T2D case and nondiabetic control subjects plotted by the cumulative risk score of each individual; values were significantly different when scores were determined by both unweighted and weighted methods (P < 0.005 for both analyses). Figure 1C and D show binned distributions of cumulative risk scores determined by unweighted and weighted methods in T2D case and nondiabetic control subjects. Figure 1C shows that the nondiabetic control group had higher percentages of individuals carrying lower-risk allele loads (<21); whereas the T2D groups generally had greater percentages of individuals carrying higher-risk allele loads. Figure 1D highlights the more pronounced distribution differences in risk allele bins between the two groups. Differences in binned distributions for both unweighted and weighted analyses were significant (P < 0.005).\n\nCumulative risk assessment\n\nThe OR and 95% CI for each of the nine bins assessed by the full logistic regression model and the model with adjustment for rs7903146 are represented in Fig. 2A (unweighted) and Fig. 2B (weighted); results are summarized in Supplementary Table 3. There was an increase in the OR with an increase in risk allele category. There was no evidence of departure from a linear trend in the association of the number of risk alleles and disease (P = 0.71). In a model in which data were reanalyzed, treating the risk allele categories as a continuous variable, there was evidence of an association between cumulative risk allele load and disease status in the unweighted and weighted analyses (unweighted OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.01–1.08], P = 0.011; weighted 1.06 [1.03–1.10], P = 8.10 × 10−5). In both types of analysis (i.e., nominal and ordinal categories for the count of risk alleles), association was no longer significant after adjusting for the number of TCF7L2 risk variant rs7903146: nominal analysis results (Supplementary Table 3 and Fig. 2A and B); ordinal analysis results (unweighted 1.02 [0.98–1.05], P = 0.33; weighted 1.02 [0.98–1.06], P = 0.40).\n\nWe found no evidence for interaction with age (P = 0.20), sex (P = 0.59), BMI (P = 0.47), or degree of African Ancestry (P = 0.74). Recall that only individuals with >0.50 proportions of African ancestry are included in these analyses."

    "content": "Results\n\nCharacteristics of the EpiDREAM cohort\n\nThe baseline clinical characteristics of participants are reported in Table 1. Of the 17 394 participants, 42.8%, 42.5% and 14.7% displayed normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance (IFG/IGT) or T2D, respectively. The ethnic distribution of individuals was significantly different in the NGT, IFG/IGT and T2D groups. There was a decreasing percentage of IFG/IGT in subjects of East Asian (66.9%), African (62.8%), European (61.0%), Native North American (55.8%), Latino American (55.5%) and South Asian (43.5%) ancestry (Supplementary Table 3). There was a decreasing percentage of T2D in subjects of East Asian (22.7%), African (18.0%), South Asian (16.1%), European (14.4%), Latino American (12.9%) and Native North American (11.8%) ancestry (Supplementary Table 3). Overall, IFG/IGT and T2D subjects were on average 5.5–6.5 years older than the NGT subjects. The percentage of females was higher across all glycemic statuses (60.9%), but males were more likely to be IFG/IGT or T2D in comparison to NGT counterparts (Table 1).\n\nEffect of baseline glycemic status on BMI level and BMI change\n\nIFG/IGT and T2D status were positively associated with BMI at baseline when compared with the NGT group (IFG/IGT: β = 0.34 ± 0.02, P = 1.35 × 10−98; T2D: β = 0.44 ± 0.02, P = 5.25 × 10−80; Table 2). There was an association between IFG/IGT status at baseline and lower BMI change during the 3.3 year follow-up in comparison with NGT subjects (IFG/IGT: β = −0.13 ± 0.03, P = 3.65 × 10−7). A significant negative association between T2D status at baseline and BMI change was also observed in comparison with NGT subjects (β = −0.34 ± 0.04, P = 1.06 × 10−19; Table 2). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and two-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) at baseline were positively associated with BMI at baseline (FPG: β = 0.19 ± 0.01, P = 1.80 × 10−145; 2hPG: β = 0.20 ± 0.01, P = 4.26 × 10−159; Table 2) and were negatively associated with BMI change during the follow-up period (FPG: β = −0.09 ± 0.01, P = 8.47 × 10−14 and 2hPG: β = −0.10 ± 0.01, P = 1.28 × 10−19; Table 2).\n\nEffect of glycemic status transition on BMI level and BMI change\n\nThe transition from NGT to IFG/IGT was positively associated with BMI at baseline (β = 0.19 ± 0.04, P = 2.60 × 10−7; Table 3) and BMI change (β = 0.19 ± 0.04, P = 2.93 × 10−6). Compared to stable NGT, converting from NGT to T2D showed a positive association with BMI at baseline (β = 0.36 ± 0.08, P = 4.35 × 10−6) and BMI change (β = 0.38 ± 0.09, P = 2.25 × 10−5), with two fold higher baseline and delta beta values compared to that observed in IFG/IGT converters. Similarly, the transition from IFG/IGT to T2D was positively associated with BMI at baseline (β = 0.20 ± 0.03, P = 6.28 × 10−11), in comparison to stable IFG/IGT over the study period. However, this association was not significant for BMI change (β = 0.06 ± 0.04, P = 8.28 × 10−2). The change in FPG levels was significantly associated with a positive increase in BMI change (β = 0.16 ± 0.01, P = 1.1 × 10−52), but was not associated with baseline BMI (β = −0.01 ± 0.01, P = 0.52). An association between change in 2hPG levels, with BMI at baseline (β = −0.03 ± 0.01, P = 1.6 ×10−3) as well as with BMI change (β = 0.17 ± 0.01, P = 2.4 × 10−45; Table 3) was also observed.\n\nMain association and interaction between obesity predisposing SNPs, glycemic status on BMI level and BMI change\n\nAssociations between the 23 obesity SNPs, the genotype risk score (GRS) and BMI at baseline, and BMI change are reported in Table 4. Three of 23 SNPs reached a significant association with BMI at baseline with a direction of effect consistent with published GWAS data: rs9939609 in FTO, rs2984618 in TAL1, and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 (0.04 ≤ β ≤ 0.08; 1.4 × 10−14 ≤ P ≤ 1.8 × 10−5; Table 4). The GRS was also significantly associated with an increased BMI at baseline (β = 0.018 ± 0.002) per additional risk allele, P = 6.4 × 10−14, Table 4). The 23 SNPs and the GRS were not significantly associated with BMI change (Table 4).\n\nInteractions between obesity SNPs/GRS and traits related to glycemic status on BMI at baseline and BMI change are reported in Table 4. There was only one significant interaction between the rs1011527 SNP in LEPR and FPG on baseline BMI (P = 3.9 × 10−7). However, no significant main effect was observed for the rs1011527 SNP in LEPR on BMI with (β = −0.02 ± 0.02; P = 0.22) or without (β = −0.01 ± 0.02; P = 0.72) the interaction term in the model. Interactions between obesity SNPs, GRS and traits related to glycemic status transition on BMI at baseline and BMI change are reported in Table 5. Overall, there was no simultaneous significant main effect and interaction between glycemic status traits or transition and obesity SNPs or GRS, in relation to BMI level and BMI change."

    "content": "Results\n\nStudy Population\n\nThe study population had a male predominance (M:F ratio 2:1) that was slightly higher than expected, but it was otherwise representative of the ALL population seen at Texas Children's Hospital (Table I). Study participants were diagnosed between 1987 and 2001 and treated on various protocols, primarily Pediatric Oncology Group protocols (including POG 9005, POG 9006, POG 9405, POG 9605, POG 8698, and POG 8699). Early MTX-related neurotoxicity occurred in 7 patients (9.7%). Impairment on the DIVERGT battery was observed in 44.3% of the study population. Mean neurocognitive test scores in the overall population demonstrated mild deficits on PEGDH (p=0.02), PEGNDH (p<0.001) and CFL (p<0.001), when compared to the expected means of 100 (Table II). All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nGenotype and Impairment on the DIVERGT Battery\n\nImpairment on the battery was related to two polymorphisms: MTHFR 1298A>C (p=0.03) and MS 2756A>G (p=0.05). Survivors with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes had a 3.0-fold increased risk of impairment (95% CI 1.1-8.1), compared to those with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype. Similarly, those with the MS 2756 AA genotype were 3.8 times as likely to meet criteria for impairment on the battery as those with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes. MTHFR 677C>T, SHMT 1520C>T, MTRR 66A>G, and TSER polymorphisms were not significantly related to general impairment on the DIVERGT battery.\n\nGenotype and Individual Child Performance Measures\n\nSeveral genotypes were related to performance on TMTA (focused attention, processing speed) and TMTB (shifting attention, processing speed), as shown in Table III. Survivors with the MTHFR 1298AC/CC genotypes performed on average 7 points lower on TMTA (p=0.11) and 13 points lower on TMTB (p=0.001), compared to those with the MTHFR 1298AA genotype. Survivors with the MS 2756AA genotype scored on average 12.2 points lower on TMTA (p=0.01) and 5.3 points lower on TMTB (p=0.23), compared to survivors with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes. Finally, survivors with TSER 2R/3R and 3R/3R genotypes scored on average 10 points lower on TMTA (p=0.07) and 11.4 points lower on TMTB (p=0.03) than those with the TSER 2R/2R genotype. MTHFR 677C>T, SHMT 1420C>T, and MTRR 66A>G polymorphisms were not associated with performance on TMTA or TMTB. Complete analyses by genotypes for all six performance measures can be found in Supplemental Table I.\n\nThe remaining neurocognitive tests assessed fine motor skills (PEGDH and PEGNDH), working memory (DIG), and executive function (CFL). For survivors with the MS 2756AA genotype, the mean PEGNDH score was 11.7 points lower than that of individuals with the MS 2756AG/GG genotypes (p=0.02). Additionally, survivors with the MTRR 66AA genotype scored on average 10.7 points lower on PEGNDH than those with the MTRR 66AG/GG genotypes (p=0.05). Survivors with the MTRR 66AA genotype also scored 10.5 points lower on average on CFL, compared with survivors with the MTRR 66AG/GG genotypes (p=0.01). Performance on the PEGDH and DIG measures were not associated with any genotype.\n\nWe did not observe an association between any child performance measure and any of the following covariates: sex, ethnicity/race, age at diagnosis, leukemia subtype, number of intrathecal MTX doses, and cumulative IV MTX exposure. The associations between genotype and child performance measures that are described above did not change after adjustment for these covariates. Of the 7 survivors with a history of early MTX-related neurotoxicity, 6 (85%) met criteria for long-term neurocognitive impairment on the DIVERGT battery. While early MTX-related neurotoxicity was predictive of long-term neurocognitive impairment (p=0.03), 25 of 63 survivors (40%) without early MTX-related neurotoxicity also went on to develop long-term neurocognitive impairment as determined by the DIVERGT battery. The 7 survivors with a history of early MTX-related neurotoxicity scored on average 15.3 points lower on TMTB than survivors without early neurotoxicity (p=0.03). Early MTX-related neurotoxicity was not predictive of impairment on TMTA, PEGDH, PEGNDH, DIG, or CFL.\n\nComplete genotyping results for all six polymorphisms were available for computation of the GRS in 59 patients. In this group, the GRS ranged from 0 to 9, with a mean of 6.2 and a median of 6. On average, survivors with a GRS ≥ 6 scored 9.5 points lower on TMTA (p=0.06) and 14.5 points lower on TMTB (p=0.002) than survivors with a GRS < 6 (Table III). No difference was observed in mean scores on PEGDH, PEGNDH, or DIG between the GRS groups. The association between the GRS and TMTB performance remained significant after adjustment for sex, age at diagnosis, intrathecal MTX exposure, and cumulative IV MTX exposure. We did not observe an association between GRS and impairment on the DIVERGT battery. However, all of the patients who demonstrated impaired performance on TMTA or TMTB (score <80) had GRS ≥ 6. No association was observed between GRS and impairment on PEGDH, PEGNDH, DIG, or CFL."

    "content": "Results\n\nAt baseline, the C risk allele at SLC30A8 rs13266634 was significantly associated with higher fasting proinsulin levels in the DPP cohort. This association was in an allele dose-dependent fashion after adjustment for baseline fasting insulin (p=0.002; Table 1) and remained statistically significant after further adjustment for fasting glucose (p=0.001; Table 1).\n\nAfter 1 year of randomised DPP intervention, fasting proinsulin levels were significantly decreased (p<0.001) in all active intervention groups compared with placebo, even after adjustment for 1 year fasting insulin, age, sex and ethnicity (Fig. 1). While intervention groups had significantly lower proinsulin levels than placebo group at 1 year, the lifestyle intervention group had the largest decrease and was significantly lower than the metformin (p<0.001) or troglitazone (p=0.002) groups. The metformin and troglitazone intervention groups had similar proinsulin levels at 1 year (p=0.86). There was no genotype × treatment interaction (p=0.78), suggesting that the dosage of SLC30A8 risk alleles did not modify the effectiveness of any treatment. As there were no significant genotype × treatment interactions, the four groups were also analysed together. At 1 year after DPP interventions, fasting proinsulin levels were no longer associated significantly with genotype at the SLC30A8 locus when adjusted for 1 year fasting insulin, age, sex and ethnicity (p=0.86; Table 1)."

    "content": "3. Results\n\n3.1. High carbohydrate diet increases and lipid emulsion attenuates the expression of PNPLA3 in mouse liver\n\nWe first analyzed how a lipogenic diet affects the expression of PNPLA3 in liver of intact mice. Compared to the group fed a stock diet (normal chow, NC), PNPLA3 mRNA was increased 7-fold in the liver of mice fed HC diet (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the inclusion of LE in the HC diet, either as HC-4% LE diet or as HC-13.5% LE diet, prevented the induction of PNPLA3 mRNA dose-dependently (Fig. 1A). Results from western blotting showed that similar changes were evident for PNPLA3 protein (Fig. 1B). Liver total TG content was significantly correlated with PNPLA3 mRNA levels in mice fed HC diet, either with or without LE (Fig. 1C).\n\n3.2. PNPLA3 is correlated with SREBP1c and ACC-1 in mouse liver\n\nTo determine if a similar pattern existed for other genes that are important in the lipogenic pathway, we also examined expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1c), a key transcriptional factor that regulates many genes involved in lipid metabolism, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-1), which is responsible for formation of malonyl-CoA in the process of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Both SREBP1c (Fig. 2A) and ACC-1 (Fig. 2B) showed a similar expression pattern to that of PNPLA3. We observed a correlation between PNPLA3 mRNA and SREBP1c mRNA (Fig. 2C; R2 =0.62; P<0.0001) and ACC-1 mRNA (Fig. 2D; R2 =0.84; P<0.0001). SREBP1c mRNA was also correlated with ACC-1 mRNA (Fig. 2E; R2 =0.85; P<0.0001). By contrast, PNPLA2 (ATGL), which can break down TG, did not differ among diets (Supplementary Fig. 1A). We also measured PNPLA3 gene expression in mouse epididymal tissue. PNPLA3 was not different among diet groups in this tissue (Supplementary Fig. 1B), although, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1C, PNPLA3 expression is highly expressed in murine adipose tissue.\n\n3.3. Hepatic PNPLA3 expression is not elevated in the liver of mice fed HF diet but is suppressed by exercise\n\nNext, we studied how high-fat feeding and physical activity may affect the expression of PNPLA3. In study 2, mice fed HF diet developed fatty liver indicated by the increased level of hepatic TG (Fig. 3A). This increase was attenuated by exercise (Fig. 3A). PNPLA3 expression was not elevated in mice with HF-induced fatty liver, compared to mice fed LF diet (Fig. 3B). Strikingly, voluntary exercise reduced PNPLA3 mRNA levels by 10-fold compared to the LF and HF diet groups (Fig. 3B). The mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Fig. 3C) and SREPB1c (Fig. 3D) did not differ between LF and HF diet groups. By contrast, ACC-1 was lower in the HF compared to the LF diet group (Fig. 3E). Moreover, exercise significantly suppressed both SREBP1c and ACC-1 gene expression (Fig. 3D and E).\n\n3.4. PNPLA3 gene expression was regulated by glucose in HepG2 cells\n\nWe investigated PNPLA3 and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) gene expression in HepG2 cells exposed to “depletion-re-feeding conditions” in which cells were cycled between no glucose (depletion), low, and high glucose media. PNPLA3 gene expression was reduced after 8 h of depletion (P < 0.05), while the level returned to base line 8 h after high glucose refeeding (Fig. 4A). After this, reduction in glucose resulted in a moderate reduction in expression, while high glucose for 8 to 24 h increased the level of expression, which, subsequently, was again completely abrogated after 16 h of starvation. ChREBP exhibited a similar pattern of expression to that of PNPLA3 (Fig. 4B), and correlation analysis showed that PNPLA3 mRNA levels were highly significantly correlated with ChREBP mRNA levels (Fig. 4C).\n\n3.5. PNPLA3 gene expression varies in response to glycolytic intermediates in HepG2 cells\n\nA series of experiments were conducted to determine whether metabolism of glucose was essential for induction of PNPLA3, and whether a specific glycolytic intermediate could be responsible for regulating PNPLA3 expression. These results showed that treatment with the non-metabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, did not induce PNPLA3 expression (Fig. 5A). Similarly, SREBP1c gene expression was induced two-fold by high glucose compared to low glucose, but suppressed by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (Fig 5B). Oil Red O staining showed that high glucose resulted in increased lipid accumulation, whereas 2-deoxy-D-glucose led to reduction of lipid content in cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B). Incubation with citrate, a Krebs cycle intermediate downstream of glucose metabolism, increased PNPLA3 levels, whereas pyruvate and acetate were ineffective (Fig. 5C). Expression patterns of FAS and ACC-1 were similar to that of PNPLA3 (Fig. 5D and E). In order to examine the specificity of PNPLA3 to citrate, cells were treated with the isomer isocitrate. The result showed that PNPLA3 was not regulated by isocitrate.\n\n3.6. PNPLA3 gene does not response to insulin and glucagon in HepG2 cells\n\nStudies conducted with 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human adipose tissue have shown that PNPLA3 gene expression is regulated by insulin. In addition, one study showed that insulin increased promoter activity of PNPLA3 gene expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Therefore, we examined whether hepatic PNPLA3 is regulated by insulin in HepG2 cells, which express the insulin receptor protein. Incubation of HepG2 cells with 10 nM insulin for 24 h did not increase PNPLA3 mRNA compare to control cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A). By contrast, the same treatment induced the expression of FAS, a known target of insulin action, by 2-fold (Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). Taken together, these data suggest that hepatic PNPLA3 does not response to insulin stimulation in HepG2 human hepatocytes. Because our in vivo data showed that exercise suppressed PNPLA3 expression, we hypothesized that exercise may stimulate glucagon secretion, and thereby decrease PNPLA3 gene expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 100 nM glucagon in low (5.5 mM) glucose medium for 24 hours had no effect on PNPLA3 mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. 3C), whereas glucagon stimulated the expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), a known target of glucagon action (Supplementary Fig. 3D).\n\n3.7. PNPLA3 gene expression is reduced in HepG2 cells by several unsaturated fatty acids\n\nThe major fatty acid components of the LE we employed, Intralipid®, are linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA), and α-linolenic acid (ALA). Since the results of our studies demonstrated that Intralipid completely reversed the induction of PNPLA3 by HC-diet in mouse liver (Fig. 1), we investigated whether certain types of fatty acids affect PNPLA3 gene expression when added directly to HepG2 cells. Interestingly, treatment with either 400 μM OA (Fig. 6A) or LA (Fig. 6B) suppressed PNPLA3 gene expression in both low glucose and high glucose conditions. By contrast, ALA had no effect on PNPLA3 gene expression under either condition (Fig. 6C). We further explored the effects of two long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on PNPLA3 gene expression. Both EPA and DHA suppressed PNPLA3 gene expression under both low and high glucose conditions (Fig. 6D). Moreover, the combination of OA, LA, and ALA (ratio: 6:3:1) significantly suppressed gene expression of PNPLA3 (Fig. 6E), SREBP1c (Fig. 6F), and FAS (Fig. 6G) in both low glucose and high glucose conditions. All of these fatty acids resulted in lipid accumulation as measured by Oil Red O staining (Supplementary Fig. 2A and C).\n\n3.8. PNPLA3 knockdown did not prevent lipid accumulation but increased FAS expression\n\nSince PNPLA3 gene expression is regulated by nutritional signals and our data had implicated PNPLA3 as a lipogenic signal, we investigated whether the knockdown of PNPLA3 in HepG2 cells affects glucose or lipid metabolism. Cells transfected with scrambled siRNA as a non-targeting control were compared to cells transfected with PNPLA3-specific siRNA. Transfection with PNPLA3 siRNA decreased PNPLA3 mRNA and protein by ~65% and ~70%, respectively in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7A, B and C). However, Oil Red O staining showed no difference between cells with knocked down PNPLA3 and controls under either low or high glucose conditions (Fig. 7E). PNPLA3 knockdown also had no effect on lipid content when cells were incubated with exogenous fatty acid (OA) (Fig. 7E). Interestingly, we found that FAS mRNA was increased approximately 2 fold in PNPLA3 siRNA-treated cells compared to control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 7D). By contrast, knockdown of FAS using a strategy similar to that used for PNPLA3 had no effect on the level of PNPLA3 expression (data not shown)."

    "content": "Results\n\nTranscriptomic changes in the hippocampus of adult male rats following PNS\n\nOur first aim was to identify gene expression changes in the hippocampus of male adult rats (at PND 62) that had been exposed to PNS. We analyzed the entire transcriptome and we found a significant modulation of 916 genes in the comparison with control animals (using 1.4 < FC < −1.4, q-value <0.05). We have visualized the most significant genes in a hierarchical clustering in Fig. 1, and listed the 916 significant genes in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nWe then performed a pathway analysis on the significantly modulated genes, in order to identify the main biological processes involved. We identified 49 biological processes that were altered by the PNS exposure, including some involved in neurodevelopment (Axonal Guidance Signaling, Protein Kinase A Signaling, Glutamate Receptor Signaling, Wnt/β-catenin Signaling, CREB Signaling in Neurons, Synaptic Long Term Depression, Synaptic Long Term Potentiation, Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling) and inflammation (IL-8 Signaling, STAT3 Pathway, CDK5 Signaling, IL-1 Signaling, IL-6 Signaling, BMP signaling pathway and TGF-β Signaling). All the significant pathways are summarized by the pie-chart detailing the relevant functional areas (Fig. 2a), while the entire list of significant pathways is presented in Supplementary Table 2. We conducted the subsequent target prioritization steps using the full list of 916 differentially regulated genes.\n\nMiRNome changes in the hippocampus of PNS rats, and combined analyses with transcriptomic changes\n\nWe subsequently investigated whether exposure to PNS causes changes in miRNAs levels, and whether the identified miRNAs could target transcripts identified in the transcriptomics analysis. After the selection of the species (Rattus Norvegicus), we identified a total number of 1218 miRNAs (including pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs); out of these, 68 miRNAs (47 of them were mature miRNAs) were significantly modulated (all with q-value <0.05) in animals exposed to prenatal stress, with sixty-five downregulated and only 3 up-regulated (see Table 1).\n\nAs both transcriptomic and miRNome analyses were conducted in the hippocampus of the same animals, we then performed a mRNA-miRNAs combining analysis that allows the identification of a panel of top-hit genes that were both modulated by PNS exposure and targeted by the miRNAs that were modulated by PNS (see Methods). These analyses identified 528 significant genes, presented in Supplementary Table 3. The specific pathways analysis shows that these were genes involved in neurodevelopment (Axonal Guidance, Protein Kinase-A Signaling, Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling, TGF-β Signaling) and inflammation (STAT3 Pathway, PTEN Signaling, ILK Signaling, IL-8 signaling); the full list of the 42 pathways is presented in Supplementary Table 4.\n\nBlood mRNA transcriptomics of early life trauma in humans\n\nComparing subjects with and without exposure to early life trauma (see Methods for sociodemographic and clinical information), we identified 250 genes that were differentially modulated (FC > 1.2, FDR q-value <0.05) (see Supplementary Table 5), involved in the modulation of 41 significant pathways. Of note, these were, again, pathways involved in neurodevelopment (Wnt/Ca + pathway, cAMP signaling, CREB signaling) and inflammation (eNOS signaling, chemokine signaling, B cell activation), similar to what we found in the PNS model. All the significant pathways are summarized by the pie-chart detailing the relevant functional areas in Fig. 2b, and listed in Supplementary Table 6.\n\nIntegrating data from PNS in animals and from early life trauma in humans\n\nIn the next step, we integrated the 528 genes obtained by combined mRNA/miRNA analyses in the hippocampus of rats exposed to PNS with the 250 genes significantly modulated in the blood of adults exposed to early life trauma. We identified 22 common genes that were present in both lists; according to the hypergeometric distribution test, the probability that these genes were not overlapping due to random probability was p = 1.8 × 10–8.\n\nFinally, we validated all of the 22 genes by Real–Time PCR, both in the hippocampus of animals and in the blood of adults exposed to childhood trauma. In line with the microarray results, 16 genes were modulated in the same direction both in the rat hippocampus and in the human blood, and 6 were modulated in the opposite direction. Specifically, 15 were up-regulated in both: Alpha-2-Macroglobulin (A2M), AT-Rich Interaction Domain 5B (ARID5B), Arrestin Domain Containing 4 (ARRDC4), EPH Receptor A4 (EPHA4), F-Box Protein 32 (FBXO32), Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), Heat Shock Transcription Factor 2 (HSF2), Isochorismatase Domain Containing 1 (ISOC1), Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor Adapter Protein 1 (LDLRAP1), Leucine-rich repeat neuronal protein 3 (LRRN3), Myosin ID (MYO1D), Phosphatidylinositol-4-Phosphate 3-Kinase, Catalytic Subunit Type 2 Beta (PIK3C2B), Phosphatidic Acid Phosphatase Type 2A (PPAP2A), Sterile Alpha Motif Domain Containing 12 (SAMD12), and Serine Incorporator 5 (SERINC5); one was down-regulated in both: Transforming Growth Factor, Beta 1 (TGF-β1); one was up-regulated in rats and down-regulated in humans: Solute Carrier Family 24 (Sodium/Potassium/Calcium Exchanger) Member 3 (SLC24A3); and 5 were down-regulated in rats and up-regulated in humans: B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL2), B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 9 (BCL9), Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1 (LEF1), Lin-54 DREAM MuvB Core Complex Component (LIN54), and Post-GPI Attachment to Proteins 1 (PGAP1). These genes are presented in Supplementary Table 7, where we also present the FCs obtained from the microarray studies and the FCs from Real Time PCR analyses. For all the above-mentioned molecular and biochemical analyses, all data met the assumptions of normal distribution and equality of variance.\n\nGene network analysis and selection of candidates for GxE interaction\n\nWe focused on the 16 genes (A2M, ARID5B, ARRDC4, EPHA4, FBXO32, FoxO1, HSF2, ISOC1, LDLRAP1, LRRN3, MYO1D, PIK3C2B, PPAP2A, SAMD12, SERINC5, and TGF-β1) that were modulated in the same direction both in animals and in humans, and we applied a gene network analysis to identify possible interactions among these genes. Indeed, our main theoretical framework was based on the notion that depression is a complex disorder, where multiple genes interact with each other as belonging to common or overlapping signaling systems. Therefore, also to minimize any chance findings, we decided a priori to select, for the subsequent GxE interaction analyses, only those genes that interacted with each other through physical interaction, co-expression or involvement in common pathways.\n\nUsing IPA Software, we observed only one cluster of interacting genes, represented by A2M, FoxO1 and TGF-β1 (Fig. 3). Using a gene enrichment/pathway analysis, we then confirmed that this cluster is involved in cytokines signaling, TGF- β1 signaling and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. As we found that A2M, FoxO1, and TGF-β1 form a single individual cluster of genes interacting with each other, we focused on these three genes for the subsequent GxE studies.\n\nGene X environment interaction studies\n\nFor our main analyses, we focused on all the SNPs located in these three genes and available in both the Grady Trauma Project and Helsinki Birth cohort (FoxO1, n = 132 SNPs; A2M, n = 91 SNPs; and TGF-β1, n = 14 SNPs), and we tested their interaction with emotional stress in childhood in predicting depressive symptoms in adulthood (BDI scores) for both cohorts (Table 2). Then, we assessed the combined effect over both cohorts and performed a meta-analysis (See Supplementary Table 8). The meta-analyses indicated that 6 SNPs, all located within the FoxO1 gene, were significantly associated with emotional stress in predicting depressive symptoms, and also survived multiple testing correction for GxE interactions, with the SNP rs17592371 showing the strongest significance (p = 0.003, Bonferroni correction). For all the 6 SNPs, p-values for heterogeneity of effects were not significant, indicating that fixed-effects meta-analysis was justified. The GxE interaction effect for the SNP rs17592371 in both cohorts is presented in Fig. 4, where we can see that individuals with “at risk” genotypes (CC) developed more depressive symptoms in the presence of early separation as compared to individuals with the “low risk” genotypes (CT and TT).\n\nWe also conducted additional, secondary analyses on these three genes, in the Grady Trauma Project sample, because it has a wider range of abuse phenotypes. Specifically, we tested the interaction between childhood sexual, physical or emotional abuse, and depressive symptoms in adulthood (BDI scores). Within FoxO1, 6 SNPs showed significant GxE interactions with sexual abuse, 40 SNPs with physical abuse and 40 SNPS with emotional abuse (although with a large overlap between SNPs); within A2M, 7 SNPs showed significant GxE interactions with emotional abuse; and within TGF-β1, 4 SNPs showed significant GxE interactions with sexual abuse and 1 SNP with emotional abuse (See Supplementary Table 9).\n\nFoxO1 is activated in hippocampal progenitor stem cells following cortisol exposure, and it mediates the negative effect of stress on neurogenesis\n\nAs FoxO1 was up-regulated both in the hippocampus of animals exposed to PNS and in the blood of subjects exposed to childhood trauma, and it was also the most significant gene from our GxE analyses across the two clinical cohorts, we decided to test the functional relevance of this gene. Specifically, we wanted to test: 1) whether the stress-induced FoxO1 upregulation could be replicated in vitro upon treatment with the human stress hormone, cortisol, using our established model of ‘depression in a dish’, the immortalized, multipotent human fetal hippocampal progenitor cell line (HPC0A07/03C); and 2) whether FoxO1 is involved in the cortisol-induced reduction of neuronal proliferation that we had previously described in this model.\n\nConsistent with our hypothesis, FoxO1 mRNA levels were significantly increased following 24 h of treatment with 100 μM cortisol (FC = + 3.9, p < 0.0001, Fig. 5a). Moreover, the cell-permeable inhibitor of FoxO1, AS1842856 (100 nM), was able to completely inhibit the cortisol-induced upregulation of FoxO1 (Fig. 5a) and the cortisol-induced reduction in neuronal proliferation (BrdU + cells; one-way ANOVA, p = 0.01 versus cortisol, Fig. 5b, c). AS1842856 alone did not exert any effects on proliferation (p = 0.9), indicating that FoxO1 mediates the effect of stress, but it is not active under baseline conditions.\n\nFinally, in order to investigate the molecular pathways by which FoxO1 signaling regulates the effects of stress on neuronal proliferation, we measured also the mRNA levels of a stress- and cortisol-induced gene, the Serum Glucocorticoid Kinase 1 (SGK-1), again following cortisol with or without AS1842856. SGK1 is a stress responsive gene that mediates some of the glucocorticoid effects on brain function, including the negative effects of cortisol on neurogenesis, and we found that SGK1 is elevated in both the hippocampus of stressed rats and in the blood of depressed patients. We found that 24 h of cortisol (100 uM) treatment up-regulates SGK1 mRNA levels (FC = + 3.7, p < 0.0001, Fig. 5a), replicating again our previous findings, and that AS1842856 was able to counteract such changes (Fig. 5a)."

    "content": "Results\n\nThrough December 2018, 359 people were referred for suspected or confirmed GCK-MODY, with 217 probands testing positive for a GCK variant either by Sanger sequencing or MODY gene panel. Of these, 72% were tested either on a research or clinical basis through the University of Chicago. Seventy-four probands have yet to be tested. Clinical information was available for a subset of probands with GCK variants (Table 1). Overall, clinical findings were similar to those with previously described pathogenic GCK variants in the. Sequence analysis identified 134 GCK variants in 217 families from the year 2008 to 2018. Of these, 107 variants were previously reported in the literature as causal. The remaining 27 variants, present in 28 probands, were to the best of our knowledge not previously described or reported (Table 2). These included 17 missense, 1 nonsense, 2 splice sites, 1 in-frame deletion, 1 in-frame duplication, and 5 insertions/deletions. After interpretation using the ACMG guidelines, 26% (7/27) of the novel GCK variants were found to be pathogenic, 56% (15/27) were likely pathogenic and 18% (5/27) were of uncertain significance. All novel variants except for Met210dup were identified in a single family. Seven variants (p.Lys13X, p.Leu185Pro, p.Val207Leu, p.Glu227Hisfs*47, p.Cys252Trp, p.Arg275Leu, and p.Ser281Pro) were previously reported by our group [, Supplementary Table] but are not included in the professional version of HGMD and are therefore further described in Table 2. Parental or extended family DNA was available for 10 out of 28 probands and co-segregation with the diabetes phenotype was established in those cases. Four of the five VUS (p.Ser127Pro, p.His141Pro, c.579+4delA, and p.Leu307Phe) were predicted to be damaging by in-silico tools. However, due to the lack of segregation data and/or phenotypic data on family members, these variants did not satisfy classification requirements for pathogenic or likely pathogenic. The p.Leu307Phe sequence change was identified in one proband with no family history of diabetes. Targeted sequencing of the parents’ DNA did not detect this sequence change and was thus presumed to be de novo in the proband. Paternity testing was not performed. The p.His317Gln moderately conserved sequence change was predicted to be tolerated by in-silico tools. This variant was detected in one proband and her mother, both of whom had stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia levels of 5.8-6.1mmol/l and 6-6.3mmol/l respectively. However, the proband reported an HbA1c level of 5.2% which is below the expected range for GCK-MODY."

Further mutual adjustment for other lipids subtypes did not alter the findings. HbA1c concentration was lower with an increasing rMED. After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, each of the concentrations of TAG, HDL-C and HbA1c remained significantly associated with the rMED. \n\nEach two-point increment in the rMED was significantly inversely associated with TAG (β − 0·005, 95 % CI − 0·007, − 0·002), LDL-C (β − 0·001, 95 % CI − 0·003, 0·000), apoB:apoA-1 ratio (β − 0·002, 95 % CI − 0·005, 0·000) and HbA1c (β − 0·001, 95 % CI − 0·002, 0·000), while it was directly associated with HDL-C (β 0·004, 95 % CI 0·002, 0·005) and apoA-1 (β 0·006, 95 % CI 0·002, 0·009) (β coefficients for log-transformed variables). The rMED was inversely associated with hypertriacylglycerolaemia (TAG>1·7 mmol/l), with OR 0·89, 95 % CI 0·81, 0·98; model 3. Sensitivity analyses did not alter the main findings.\n\nAssociation between glucokinase regulatory protein SNP and metabolic markers\n\nBaseline characteristics according to the GCKR rs780094 SNP showed that no significant differences were observed in relation to age, sex, BMI, WC, social class and physical activity. Significant differences were found for educational level and lipid medication (see online Supplementary Table S1). The AA genotype (frequency 15·6 %) was associated with 0·16 mmol/l higher TAG concentrations compared with GG individuals in adjusted analyses (Table 3). The AA genotype was also significantly positively associated with TC and apoB, but no significant differences were found for other lipid parameters (HDL-C and apoA-1) by genotype (Table 3). We found a tendency towards lower HbA1c concentration for the A allele, but this was not statistically significant. Application of the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons did not alter these findings. Both GA and AA genotypes v. GG genotype were associated with a greater risk of hypertriacylglycerolaemia in adjusted analyses (GA: OR 1·23, 95 % CI 1·15, 1·33; AA: OR 1·47, 95 % CI 1·33, 1·62). \n\nJoint results of genotype and Mediterranean diet adherence on metabolic markers\n\n Table 4 demonstrates the joint results of genotype and MD adherence on metabolic parameters. Participants with the highest risk (AA genotype and with the lowest rMED) had 12·5 % higher TAG concentrations (mean 1·68 (95 % CI 1·63, 1·73) mmol/l) than those who had the lowest risk (mean 1·47 (95 % CI 1·45, 1·50) mmol/l; GG genotype with the highest rMED; Table 4). Similar results were found for TC concentrations (2·3 % higher) and apoB (3·1 % higher), respectively (Table 4). For HbA1c, the converse was the case with those who were GG homozygous with the lowest rMED having 3·3 % higher HbA1c concentration (Table 4). However, the association of MD adherence and metabolic markers did not differ significantly by genotype, with no significant gene–diet interactions for lipids or for HbA1c (TAG, P= 0·770; TC, P= 0·761; apoB, P= 0·860; HbA1c, P= 0·481). These findings were unchanged with correction for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. \n\nSimilar results were found when we analysed the rs1260326 SNP (in high linkage disequilibrium with the rs780094 SNP, r 2 0·94) in a small sample (n 7273; data not shown). Furthermore, we performed a subgroup analysis stratified by age ( < 59·1 years old v. >59·1 years old; cut-off points selected by median), physical activity (inactive or moderately inactive v. active or moderately active) and smoking status (smoker v. non-smoker) for the outcomes analysed in order to examine whether in any of these strata, a significant gene–diet interaction was obtained. We did not find any interaction, though there were differences by genotype in TAG levels in both strata for each of those three factors (data not shown)."

    "content": "Results\n\nA total of 65 patients (47 males and 18 females) with a diagnosis of CHI were included in the study. Age at diagnosis ranged from immediately following birth to seven years old. Twenty-three patients (35.4%) were macrosomic and their mean birth weight was 3,690 g. Sixty-two patients were born at term. The CHI symptoms were first noted during the neonatal period in 29 patients (44.6%), during the infancy period (1-12 months) in 26 patients (40%) and during childhood (>12 months) in 10 patients (15.4%).\n\nOf the 65 patients, 13 were diazoxide-unresponsive, 40 patients were diazoxide-responsive and 12 received dietary treatment only. Patients were divided into two groups based on diazoxide responsiveness; Group 1, diazoxide-unresponsive and Group 2, responsive to diazoxide or dietary treatment. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of the patients in the two groups are presented in Table 1. Age at onset of CHI was significantly different between these two groups. The neonatal form comprised 92.3% of Group 1, but only 32.7% of Group 2. There was a significantly higher incidence of epilepsy in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p<0.05). The time between symptom manifestation and diagnosis ranged from one day to six years, and the duration was again significantly longer in Group 2. A patient (Case 61) in Group 2 was six years old and was initially misdiagnosed as having a seizure disorder before the hypoglycemia was detected.\n\nIn our study, ABCC8 mutations were identified in 16 children (25% of the cohort), and no KCNJ11 mutations were identified on KATP channel gene mutation analysis. Five patients with persistent HA had mutations in GLUD1 (Figure 1). No variants were found in the GCK gene. Fifteen different ABCC8 mutations were discovered, five mutations were compound heterozygous, 11 were heterozygous and none were homozygous (Table 2). Among the children who carried compound heterozygous mutations, diazoxide treatment was effective in three children. Treatment was not effective in one child and one child was regulated with diet.\n\nThe most common mutation was a deletion/insertion mutation c.3224-3226delACC ins CAGCCAGGAACTG (p.Thr1042GlnfsX75) found in five unrelated patients, which possibly represents a relatively common mutation in southern China. Five novel ABCC8 mutations (p.Phe5SerfsX72, p.Gln273ArgfsX85, p.Leu724del, p.Asp1447Gly and IVS 25-1G>T) were identified. Of the novel mutations, two were frameshift mutations, one was a deletion mutation, one was a missense mutation and one was a splice site mutation. In accordance with the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), two variants were perceived as “pathogenic” and three variants were predicted as “likely pathogenic”. A novel heterozygous variant in ABCC8 gene was identified in case 22. The patient has now been on therapy with diazoxide for more than one year at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day with normal growth and development. In one case (patient 59), two novel mutations were identified. This girl was macrosomic at birth. Hypoglycemia was first detected on day three after birth at a local hospital, and improved with frequent feedings. However, her parents did not monitor her blood glucose. She was admitted to our hospital at age 14 months for brief generalized convulsive periods. Laboratory tests revealed hypoglycemia (blood glucose: 2.5 mmol/L) HI (plasma insulin level: 5.9 µIU/mL) when she had an episode. Four hourly daytime feeds (solids and cow’s milk) and four hourly uncooked cornstarch (1.6 g/kg) could maintain the blood glucose above 3.5 mmol/L. During six months follow-up, there was no episodes of hypoglycemia. However, she had sustained hypoglycaemic brain injury with global developmental delay.\n\nIn this study, 16 parents underwent genetic analysis. Five patients (patients 1, 5, 10, 14 and 18) had paternally inherited monoallelic mutations. Of the five patients, three were diazoxide-unresponsive and two were diazoxide-responsive. In the three diazoxide-unresponsive patients (patients 1, 5 and 10), diffuse pancreatic disease was confirmed following surgery. One patient (patient 3) had two heterozygous mutations: one missense mutation c.314A>C (p.His105Pro) in exon 3, inherited from his father and a nonsense mutation c.2800C>T (p.Gln934X) in exon 23 inherited from his mother. He was diazoxide-unresponsive, which had been previously reported. The 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan indicated a focal lesion in the head of the pancreas, whereas the histology of the resected pancreas showed atypical form. The enlargement of pancreatic β-cell nuclei were distributed mainly in the head but included the body and tail of the pancreas. The abnormal active endocrine cells were not restricted to a focal lesion nor were they present throughout the entire pancreas.\n\nThe GLUD1 gene was detected in patients with hypoglycaemia, HI and mild HA. Three different heterozygous mutations in the GLUD1 gene were identified in five patients. The p.Arg322 His mutation was found in patients 54, 55 and 56. Patients 55 and 56 were sisters. The mutation was autosomal and dominantly inherited from their father, who was an asymptomatic carrier. The p.Ser498Leu mutation was found in patient 52 and the p.Asn463Asp mutation in patient 53. All mutations have been previously reported in patients with HI/HA. The serum ammonia concentration of this group of patients was 85-184 µmol/l. After a confirmation of the diagnosis of HI/HA syndrome due to a GLUD1 genetic defect, the patients were started on a low-protein diet (1.5 g/kg/day of natural protein intake). Three patients (patients 54, 55 and 56) were successfully managed by diet alone. They have had no further hypoglycaemic episodes. The other two patients were responsive to diazoxide treatment.\n\nOf 65 patients, 40 (61.5%) achieved long-term stable glycaemic control by diazoxide alone. Octreotide was administered to three children who were not responsive to diazoxide. Among these three patients, two were unresponsive to octreotide, and one patient discontinued this drug due to severe diarrhoea. Side effects of the diazoxide treatment were observed in 32 (80%) patients. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, severe gastrointestinal upset and poor appetite occurred in 69%. Six patients were fed through a nasogastric tube because of severe gastrointestinal reactions and their blood glucose levels were kept relatively stable. Different degrees of hypertrichosis occurred in 55% (22/40) of patients during clinical follow-up. In one case (patient 43), effective diazoxide therapy had to be stopped because of thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nPancreatectomy was performed in 10 patients who were unresponsive to drugs. Nine patients were treated with subtotal pancreatectomy, and one patient underwent pancreatectomy twice. In patient 3, a second resection of the pancreas was required because of sustained hypoglycaemia. Histological examination of the resected pancreatic tissue confirmed diffuse disease in nine patients and atypical form in one patient. One patient (patient 7) who underwent surgery at two months of age developed diabetes mellitus at five years of age and was treated with insulin. Case 8 developed diabetes mellitus immediately after surgery and required insulin treatment. Two cases still had mild hypoglycaemia after surgery; one (patient 4) was successfully managed with regular daytime and overnight feedings and the other (patient 9) was treated with diazoxide. Only one case had symptoms of malabsorption.\n\nDiazoxide treatment was stopped in 14 of patients (35%), between the ages of six months and four years, and no recurrence of hypoglycaemia was observed. Eight patients with subtotal resection were able to maintain normal blood glucose and HbA1c levels during the duration of follow-up. There were three diazoxide-unresponsive patients: one patient died of multiorgan failure and two patients abandoned the treatment and died of severe hypoglycemia after three to seven days at home."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nLevels of KBs across the categories of glucose tolerance.\n\nWe evaluated the association of AcAc and BHB in nondiabetic individuals and individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG) categories (Fig. 1). FPG ≤5.4 mmol/L and 2hPG ≤5.9 mmol/L were set as the reference categories. In the FPG category, AcAc levels decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in individuals with IFG by −2% (95% CI −4 to −0) and increased significantly (P < 0.01) in individuals with newly detected diabetes by +64% (+16 to +109), as compared with the reference category. BHB level decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in subjects with IFG by −5% (−7 to −3) and increased significantly (P < 0.01) in the diabetic range by +99% (+6 to +186). In the 2hPG category, AcAc level increased significantly (P < 0.01) in subjects with IGT by +21% (+13 to +28) as well as in newly diagnosed diabetes by +29% (+16 to +42), as compared with the reference category. BHB level increased nominally in IGT (P < 0.05) by +12% (+4 to +20) and in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (P < 0.01) by +52% (+23 to +79), as compared with the reference category. Fasting AcAc and BHB levels correlated significantly with FPG (r = −0.051, P = 1.9 × 10−6, and r = −0.065, P = 1.4 × 10−9, respectively) and 2hPG levels (r = 0.079, P = 1.4 × 10−13, and r = 0.042, P = 9.2 × 10−5, respectively).\n\nKBs and the risk of hyperglycemia and incident diabetes.\n\nFollow-up data of 4,335 participants were available from the ongoing prospective METSIM 5-year follow-up study. A total of 276 participants developed incident diabetes between the baseline and follow-up studies (follow-up of 5 years). Most of the participants who developed new diabetes on the basis of FPG level (62 of 70 participants) had their FPG in the range of 7.0–7.5 mmol/L, and most of the participants who developed new diabetes on the basis of 2hPG had their 2hPG level (52 of 80 participants) in the range of 11.1–12.0 mmol/L. AcAc and BHB levels adjusted for confounding factors known to increase the risk of diabetes (age, BMI, smoking, and physical activity) predicted an increase in glucose AUC evaluated as a continuous variable at follow-up (P = 2.3 × 10−4 and P = 5.7 × 10−6, respectively), and quite similar results were obtained for the comparison of the highest quartile of glucose AUC versus the three lowest quartiles of glucose AUC (P = 7.9 × 10−8 and P = 3.4 × 10−6, respectively) (Table 1). After further adjustment for baseline glucose AUC, the associations lost their statistical significance. The highest quartile of AcAc adjusted for age, BMI, smoking, and physical activity predicted conversion to type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.32 [95% CI 1.00–1.74], P = 0.047) (Table 2), and also after further adjustment for FPG (OR 1.41 [1.06–1.89], P = 0.019). Adjustment for 2hPG, instead of FPG, abolished statistical significance (P = 0.423). When analyzed in glucose tolerance categories, AcAc predicted incident diabetes in individuals with IFG (OR 1.49 [1.12–1.99], P = 0.007) after the adjustment for confounding factors.\n\nAdditional adjustment for insulin sensitivity strengthened the association of KBs with development of hyperglycemia and conversion to type 2 diabetes, whereas insulin secretion weakened/abolished these associations (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nLevels of KBs across the quintiles of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.\n\nTo study the mechanisms by which KBs could be linked to hyperglycemia, we investigated their association with insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. The levels of AcAc and BHB increased significantly (P < 0.01) in the highest quintile of Matsuda ISI up to 29 and 41%, respectively (Fig. 2). AcAc and BHB levels decreased significantly (P < 0.01) by −23 and −29%, respectively, in the highest quintile of insulin secretion (adjusted for insulin sensitivity) compared with the lowest quintile. In a multivariate linear regression model including insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion as independent variables, insulin sensitivity remained inversely associated with AcAc (P < 1.0 × 10−19) and BHB levels (P < 1.0 × 10−22).\n\nAssociation of risk SNPs for type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia with the levels of KBs.\n\nAssociations of 62 risk SNPs for type 2 diabetes or hyperglycemia with KB levels are shown in Table 3. After correction for multiple testing (threshold of statistical significance, P < 4.0 × 10−4), the glucose-increasing C allele of rs780094 of GCKR showed a significant association with elevated levels of BHB (effect size +5.6% per the C allele, P = 3.7 × 10−6 after adjusting for age and BMI) and a nominally significant association with AcAc (+3.9%, P = 0.003). Additionally, there were nominally significant associations for SNPs of FADS1, ANK1, GIPR, HMGA2, and SLC2A2 with the levels of AcAc or BHB or both (Table 3).\n\nGene expression of genes involved in KB metabolism.\n\nCorrelations of adipose tissue mRNA expression with the most important genes regulating FFA oxidation, ketogenesis, and ketolysis are shown in Table 4. Pearson correlation of fasting FFAs with AcAc was 0.483 (P < 0.001) and with BHB was 0.443 (P < 0.001) in nondiabetic METSIM participants, and therefore genes regulating FFA metabolism were included in statistical analyses. Adipose tissue mRNA expression of the gene encoding CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) was positively correlated with glucose AUC and inversely with Matsuda ISI. This enzyme regulates the binding of carnitine to long-chain fatty acids, allowing them to be transported to the mitochondria for FFA oxidation. Expression of genes regulating ketogenesis, HMGCS1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1, soluble) and HMGCS2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2, mitochondrial), did not correlate significantly with glucose AUC, insulin sensitivity, or insulin secretion. In contrast, significant correlations were found with adipose tissue mRNA expression levels of several genes associated with ketolysis with glucose metabolism parameters. Of these genes, ACAT1 expression had the most significant correlations with glucose AUC (r = −0.314, P = 6.1 × 10−6), Matsuda ISI (r = 0.479, P = 7.1 × 10−13), and insulin secretion (r = −0.444, P = 7.0 × 10−11). ACAT1 encodes acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1, an enzyme responsible for the last step in KB breakdown where two molecules of acetyl-CoA are generated from acetoacetyl-CoA (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, expression of other genes regulating ketolysis, BDH1 (BHB dehydrogenase, type 1), OXCT1 (3-oxoacid CoA transferase 1), and ACSS2 (acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2), was inversely correlated with glucose AUC and insulin secretion and positively correlated with Matsuda ISI. Adipose tissue mRNA expression of ketolysis genes did not correlate with the levels of KBs (all correlations <0.10, P = NS)."

    "content": "Results\n\nCardiometabolic SNPs in CRP GWAS\n\nFirst, we used QQ-plots to evaluate whether the p-values for the associations of the 283 cardiometabolic SNPs with serum CRP are distributed differently from what is expected under the null hypothesis in each trait group. As depicted in Fig. 1, the leftward deviation of the dotted lines in the QQ-plots shows that the 283 SNPs known for cardiometabolic phenotypes to have p-values smaller than expected under the null hypothesis in the CRP GWAS (p-value: 7.2×10-306).\n\nA total of 19 SNPs out of 283 independent cardiometabolic SNPs (6.7%) were associated with CRP after correction for multiple testing (p-value threshold 1.1×10-04). These 19 SNPs were located within or close to 12 different genes APOC1, HNF1A, GCKR, IL6R, PPP1R3B, HNF4A, PABPC4, BCL7B, FTO, TMEM18, PLTP and MC4R. Table 2 shows the SNPs with the lowest p-values in the 12 pleiotropic loci based on the CRP GWAS, i.e. the lowest p-value in that genomic locus. The eight SNPs in Table 2 with the lowest p-value were already known to be associated with CRP based on the recent CRP GWAS. The next four SNPs were not identified in the genome-wide association study of CRP. The first novel association was rs1558902 with a p-value of 2.2×10-6. This SNP is located in the first intron of the FTO gene on chromosome 16. The second novel signal was the SNP rs2867125 which is located on chromosome 2, near 46kb downstream of TMEM18. This SNP had a p-value of 5.0×10-6 in the CRP meta-analysis. The third association was with rs6065906 which is located on chromosome 20, near the PLTP and PCIF1 gene (p-value = 6.7×10-6). The last finding was rs571312 which is located 2 Mb upstream of the MC4R gene on chromosome 18 (p-value = 3.8×10-5).\n\nAmong the associated SNPs, we observed many SNPs with different directions of effect on the cardiometabolic phenotypes and CRP than one would expect based on the association of CRP and these phenotypes in observational data. As an example, the A-allele of the SNP rs4420638 in the APOC1 locus increases serum CRP levels. However, this allele is associated with a decrease in the level of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. We also observed such effects for the G-allele of the SNP rs1183910 in the HNF1A locus. This allele increases serum CRP levels and is associated with a decline in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.\n\nOut of the 12 pleiotropic loci, 6 loci had the same lead SNP in both the CRP and one or more of the cardiometabolic GWAS. In the other 6 loci the lead SNPs were different between the CRP GWAS and the cardiometabolic GWAS. However, in the majority of these loci the lead SNPs of the cardiometabolic GWAS were in high LD (r 2 > 0.8) with the lead SNP in the CRP GWAS. In the IL6R locus we observed the lowest LD between the top hit in the CRP GWAS and the CAD GWAS (r 2 = 0.52).\n\nCRP SNPs in cardiometabolic GWAS\n\nWe used the same QQ-plots as described previously to evaluate whether the association p-values for the 18 CRP SNPs are distributed differently from what is expected under the null hypothesis in the different cardiometabolic GWAS. As depicted by the leftward deviation of the dotted lines in the QQ-plots for CAD (p = 1.4×10-09), the cholesterol phenotypes (HDL-cholesterol, p = 6.4×10-69; LDL-cholesterol, p = 2.9×10-166; total cholesterol, p = 3.6×10-169 and triglycerides, p = 2.5×10-196) and the glycemic phenotypes (fasting glucose, p = 2.4×10-12 and fasting insulin 5.5×10-04), the p-values for the association between the 18 CRP SNPs and these phenotypes are significantly smaller than expected under the null hypothesis (Fig. 2). We did not observe such a significant deviation in the QQ-plots of BMI (p = 0.18) and SBP (p = 0.06).\n\nResults of the association of the 18 genome-wide significant associations with CRP-level are depicted in Fig. 3 (S1 and S2 tables). We observed 9 associations with one or more of the 10 cardiometabolic phenotypes close to or within the genes APOC1, HNF1A, IL6R, GCKR, IL1F10, PPP1R3B, HNF4A, PABPC and BCL7B (p-value < 1.1×10-4). Only 1 gene (IL1F10) was not identified in the previous analysis where we tested the association between the cardiometabolic SNPs and CRP. Among all 9 associations, we found three associations that are not reported in the GWAS for that specific phenotype. The first was rs1183910 with CAD (p-value 5.6×10-6). This SNP is located in the first intron of the HNF1A gene on chromosome 12. The second was rs6734238 with total cholesterol (p-value 1.16×10-5). This SNP is located on chromosome 2, nearby the IL1F10 gene and other interleukin 1 family genes. The third was rs4420638 with T2D (p-value 4.0x10-6) nearby the APOC1 gene on chromosome 19.\n\nComparable with the previous associations results, we observed many different direction of effects. For instance, the A-allele of the SNP rs4420638 in the APOC1 locus increases serum CRP levels and is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the G-allele of the SNP rs1183910 in the HNF1A locus increases serum CRP levels and is associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease.\n\nExploring the type of pleiotropy\n\nWe observed a total number of 13 genetic regions with pleiotropic effects on CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes: 12 regions identified in the first step testing the cardiometabolic SNPs with CRP and 1 additional region identified in the second step testing the associations of the CRP SNPs with the cardiometabolic phenotypes. Table 3 shows the unadjusted and adjusted associations between the 13 overlapping SNPs and CRP-level using individual level data from the WGHS. There was no significant association in the WGHS between the SNPs located near PLTP and MC4R and CRP after correction for multiple testing. The effect sizes of the genetic loci in or near the genes APOC1, HNF1A, IL6R, PPP1R3B, HNF4A and IL1F10 did not diminish substantially after adjustment for BMI, cholesterol levels and HbA1C suggesting biological pleiotropy. For BCL7B, FTO and TMEM18 the effect sizes decreased considerably implying mediated pleiotropy. The estimate of the association between rs1260326 (GCKR) and CRP decreased substantially after adjustment but was still strongly associated. We observed the same scenario for the association between rs4660293 (PABPC4) and CRP. When we added the phenotypes in a stepwise manner to the model, we observed for the mediated pleiotropic loci FTO and TMEM18 that the effect was mainly mediated through BMI (S3 Table). For BCL7B and PABPC4, lipids appeared to be the most important mediators. Fig. 4 shows graphically the biological and mediated pleiotropic effects.\n\nThe results for the associations between the pleiotropic SNPs and the associated cardiometabolic phenotypes are presented in S4 Table. Eight SNPs were not significantly associated with the cardiometabolic phenotype in the WGHS after adjustment for multiple testing. The majority of the estimates in- or decreased slightly after adjustment for CRP. However, the estimates between APOC1 and HbA1C, PABPC4 and triglycerides and BCL7B and HDL-cholesterol decreased considerably after the adjustment for CRP.\n\nPathway analysis\n\nThe results from the pathway analysis including all 13 pleiotropic genes are listed in the S5 Table. A total number of 13 canonical pathways were significantly enriched using an FDR of five percent. The top pathways included the FXR/RXR activation (p = 7.4×10-09), LXR/RXR activation (p = 4.6×10-05), Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) signaling (p = 7.6×10-05), hepatic cholestasis (p = 1.1×10-04) and acute phase response signaling (p = 1.3×10-04)."

The clinical characteristics including sex, age of both groups, and the number of aneurysms in the cases enrolled in our study are shown in Table 1. The mean age of all subjects was almost identical. There were more females among the cases (63.4%) than those in the controls (51.9%). The genotype and allele frequencies distribution of both polymorphisms in the control group met the requirements of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genotype and allele frequencies of the two SNPs and the combined genotypes frequencies of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro are summarized in Tables 2, 3 and 4. The CC genotype of miR-34b/c rs4938723 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IA, compared with the TT genotype (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.11–0.73, P = 0.006). However, no association between TP53 Arg72Pro and the risk of IA was observed for genotypic or allelic association analysis. We also examined the combined effects of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro variants on IA risk. As shown in Table 3, the carriers with the combined genotypes of rs4938723CC and TP53 Arg72Pro CG/CC/GG had a 0.27-fold decreased risk of IA (OR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11–0.70, P = 0.004), compared with those carrying rs4938723CT/TT + TP53 Arg72Pro CG/CC/GG combined genotypes, while no other association between combined effects of miR-34b/c rs4938723 and TP53 Arg72Pro variants on IA risk was found. When stratification analysis was done by gender, no association was found (Tables 5 and 6). No significant association between the two SNPs and the number of aneurysms was observed (Table 7)."

    "content": "Results\n\nGWAS was performed on 815 children from 263 Hispanic families. Mean ± SD (range) was 25.2±7.5 (13.4 to 61.9) for the children’s BMI, 85.6±20.8 (4 to100) for BMI percentile and 1.52±1.01 (−3.0 to 4.5) for BMI z-score. Measured genotype analysis examined 129 obesity-related traits including BMI and adiposity as well as biological processes associated with the pathophysiology of childhood obesity; a description of the phenotypes is provided in Table S1. In our GWAS, population stratification was not significant and therefore did not confound our associations. A complete listing of all suggestive (p<1.0E-06) and genome-wide significant (p<1.0E-07) genetic variants and their associated traits are presented by chromosomal position in Table S2.\n\nAnthropometry and Body Composition\n\nBMI status, body composition and the growth process were assessed from repeated measurements of body weight, height, FFM and FM at baseline and after one-year ( Table 1 ). A nonsynonymous SNP (rs1056513; G1178S (NP_005790.2)) in INADL on chromosome 1 attained near genome-wide significance (p = 1.2E-07) for weight, and BMI, FFM, FM, trunk FM, and hip circumference (p = 8.3E-06 to 1.6E-07). SNP rs1056513 is common (MAF = 0.50) and accounted for 3% of the variance in body weight and body composition in this cohort. Weight z-score change was significantly associated with an intronic variant in COL4A1 on chromosome 13 (p = 4.7E-08) (Supporting Information Figure S1). Linear growth (height change) was associated with a variant in the 5′UTR region of TSEN34 on chromosome 19 (p = 4.5E-08).\n\nEndometabolic Traits\n\nGenome-wide significant variants were identified for several endometabolic traits ( Table 2 ). An intronic variant in MTNR1B on chromosome 11 was strongly associated with fasting glucose (p = 3.7E-08). Intronic and 3′UTR variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region on chromosome 11 were associated with triglycerides (p = 2.5-4.8E-08). An intronic variant in PCSK2 on chromosome 20 was associated with total antioxidants (p = 7.6E-08). Variants in the flanking 3′UTR regions of RNASE1 on chromosome 14 and ASS1P11 on chromosome 7 were associated with 24-h urinary nitrogen excretion and creatinine excretion, respectively (p = 8.2-8.4E-08). An intronic SNP in GCH1 on chromosome 14 was associated with 24-h urinary dopamine: creatinine ratio (p = 6.3E-08). A nonsynonymous SNP (rs3733402; S143T (NP_000883.2)) in KLKB1 on chromosome 4 was identified for serum free IGF-1. An intronic SNP in MPRIP on chromosome 17 was associated with serum IGFBP-3 (p = 7.2E-08). A block of twenty-three SNPs in the flanking 5′UTR region of XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) on chromosome 9 were highly associated with serum TSH (p = 5.5E-08 to 1.0E-09) and found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with one another (R = 0.91−1.00).\n\nInflammation Markers\n\nGenome-wide significant variants were identified for inflammation markers ( Table 3 ). Highly significant associations for a nonsynonymous SNP (rs12075; G42D (NP_002027.2) (p = 1.3E-21) and an intronic SNP (p = 3.6E-13) in DARC on chromosome 1 were identified for MCP-1. Coding variants in GREB1 on chromosome 2 (p = 6.5E-08) and DFNB31 on chromosome 9 (p = 2.0E-08) were also identified for MCP-1. A variants in the 3′UTR for CCR3 was highly associated with MCP1, as well as an intronic SNP in RASGEF1A (p = 4.6-9.6E-08). A variant in the intronic region of ABO was strongly associated with IL-6 (p = 2.0E-08).\n\nDiet, Energy Expenditure, Substrate Utilization and Physical Activity\n\nGenome-wide significant variants were associated with energy intake, energy expenditure and substrate utilization, and physical activity ( Table 4 ). An intronic variant in TMEM229B on chromosome 14 was associated with ad libitum energy intake at dinner (p = 5.1E-08). An intronic variant in ARHGAP11A on chromosome 15 was associated with sleep duration (p = 5.0E-08). A SNP in the intronic region of C21orf34 was detected for respiratory quotient (RQ) during sleep (p = 5.3E-08). A variant was identified for accelerometer-measured light activity in the 5′UTR region of RPL7P3 on chromosome 9 (p = 7.5E-08) and sedentary-light activity in 3′UTR of CTCFL on chromosome 20 (p = 3.6E-08). In addition, adjusting for body weight, highly significant variants were identified for total energy expenditure (p = 2.7E-08) for MATK on chromosome 19 and sleeping energy expenditure (p = 6.0E-08) for CHRNA3 on chromosome 15."

    "content": "Results\n\nAPOBR\n\nThe mutation screen of the coding region of the APOBR in 95 extremely obese children and adolescents revealed 13 sequence variants (rs74949322, rs151233, rs149271, rs3833080, rs368546180, rs180743, rs180744, rs151174, rs40831, rs61738759, rs200751685, rs40833, and rs142786317; S1 Table). Three of these affect the amino acid sequence (rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9, rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9, and rs180743: p.Pro428Ala; Table 2).\n\nThe common deletion rs3833080 (c.1036_1062del27; S1 Data) was present in each individual of the initial screen either hetero- or homozygously. The variant is located in the repeat region of APOBR with no predicted function and deletes one full repeat [GlyGlyGluGluAlaGluThrAlaSer] of the amino acid sequence. In silico prediction for rs3833080 implicated no functional effect (Table 2).\n\nThe non-synonymous, non-conservative SNP rs180743: p.Pro428Ala is located closely to the deletion rs3833080 which is in high LD with the variant (r2 = 0.98). Due to the high LD with rs2008514, both variants were carried, at least heterozygously, in all individuals of the initial screen. Functional in silico prediction for the risk allele is variable, although the SNP is located in a conserved position (conservation 66% among 29 species, ENSEMBL). SIFT and PolyPhen2 rated this SNP as deleterious, while PANTHER, SNAP and PMUT rated it as neutral (Table 2). Although the overall prediction is “Polymorphism”, Mutation Taster predicted the introduction of a new splice site, thereby disruption of a glutamate-rich region and potential loss of a phosphoserine domain (Table 2).\n\nThe deletion rs368546180 with a length of 27bp (c.933_934insdel27; p.Ala328_Gly329) results in an in frame shortened amino acid sequence of the repeat region of APOBR with no predicted function. The in silico prediction of the variant is ambiguous (Mutation Taster “Polymorphism”, SIFT “neutral”, PROVEAN “deleterious”; Table 2). It was identified once heterozygously in an extremely obese child. The female mutation carrier (height 147 cm, weight 49 kg, BMI 22.68 kg/m2, BMI SDS 1.44, age 10.5 years, 93rd age and sex specific BMI percentile) inherited the mutation from her obese mother (BMI 39.06 kg/m2) while the overweight (BMI 25.65 kg/m2) father did not harbor the deletion. The girl also homozygously carried the risk alleles (minor alleles) at rs180743: p.Pro428Ala and rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9.\n\nCase-control association analyses based on 1,873 extremely obese cases and 435 lean controls were performed for the two frequent, coding variants rs180743: p.Pro428Ala and rs3833080: p.Gly369_Asp370del9 and the second infrequent deletion rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9. The APOBR rs180743 G-allele was nominally associated with obesity (odds ratio (OR) per allele = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–1.47, p = 0.002, see Table 3). Similarly, the deletion allele of rs3833080 was nominally associated with obesity (OR = 1.25 per allele; 95%CI: 1.08–1.45, p = 0.003). Family-based association studies (based on 615 obesity trios) for rs3833080 and rs180743 confirmed these associations (Table 3). While genotyping rs3833080 we also observed the insertion allele (p.Gly369_Asp370insGluGluAlaGlyThrAlaSerGlyGly), with a much lower frequency and exclusively in (extremely) obese cases (minor allele frequency of 0.001 in 2,540 cases) but not in 481 lean or normal weight controls. The second deletion rs368546180: p.Thr321_Gly329del9 was only observed once in all screened individuals. Consequently, association analysis could not be performed (Table 3).\n\nThe remaining nine variants were located in the un-translated region (UTR) or intronic regions or were synonymous (rs74949322: c.57+50C>T, rs151233: p.Leu22 =, rs149271: p.Glu170 =, rs180744: p.Gln553 =, rs151174: p.Gly560 =, rs40831: p.Ala686 =, rs61738759: p.Pro1012 =, rs40833: c.*218C>G and rs142786317: c.*118_*119delCA; S1 Table). In silico analysis showed that the infrequent alleles at these variants caused changes of either transcription factor binding sites splicing enhancer and silencer binding sites, or both (S1 Table).\n\nSULT1A1\n\nOf the initially detected variants (7 non-synonymous, S2 Data) in the coding region of SULT1A1 in 95 extremely obese children and adolescents, none could be confirmed with an independent method. A high sequence similarity between the SULT1A gene family allowed for unspecific amplification of several SULT1A genes for individuals in the mutation screen resulting in artifacts. Hence, apart from SULT1A1 we also amplified one or more SULT1 gene family members. So that a variant that seemed to be located in SULT1A1 was in fact attributable to SULT1A2, where it represents the wild type allele (see S2 Data and S2 Table for more detail). For the variant Met1Val, which could not be explained by one of the other SULT1A family members, two independent genotyping methods could not replicate our initial uni-directional Sanger-resequencing finding. We hence deemed this variant an artifact.\n\nFor the synonymous variants in SULT1A1, in silico predictions varied. All variants were predicted to change splicing enhancer and silencers, or to directly affect splice sites or transcription factor binding sites (S1 Table). Particularly for the variant p.Pro200 = (rs3176926), both changes in the binding domains of splicing regulators as well for the transcription factor AML-1 were predicted.\n\nSULT1A2\n\nIn SULT1A2 seven non-synonymous SNPs were detected (rs4149403: p.Ile7Thr, rs10797300: p.Pro19Leu, rs145008170: p.Ser44Asn, rs4987024: p.Tyr62Phe, rs142241142: p.Ala164Val, rs1059491: p.Asn235Thr, rs75191166: p.Lys282Gly); two synonymous SNPs (rs1690407: p.Ser8 =, rs139896537: p.Ala164 =; S1 Table), and five non-coding variants (rs4149406, rs3743963, rs710410, rs762634, rs145790611; S1 Table) were also identified.\n\nFor the non-conservative, non-synonymous SNP rs1136703: p.Ile7Thr (c.20T/C), in silico analyses did not predict a functional effect (Table 2). For rs10797300: p.Pro19Leu (c.56C/T), in silico programs predicted a functional modification (PolyPhen2 and PANTHER, Table 2). The conservative non-synonymous polymorphism rs145008170: p.Ser44Asn (c.131G/A) is located close to Lys48, which is relevant for binding of the xenobiotic p-nitrophenol to the binding pocket of SULT1A2. In silico analyses predicted a “non-neutral” (SNAP) or “deleterious” (PANTHER; Table 2) functional change. The infrequent missense variants rs4987024: p.Tyr62Phe (c.185A/T) and rs142241142: p.Ala164Val (c.491C/T) are non-conservative amino acid exchanges which are not located close to the binding pocket of SULT1A2. In silico, a higher probability of functional changes was predicted for p.Tyr62Phe than for p.Ala164Val (Poly Phen 2 “probably damaging”), although the analyses revealed mixed results (Table 2). In silico prediction mostly interpreted the conservative SNP rs1059491: p.Asn235Thr (c.704A/C) as functionally relevant (“probably damaging” PolyPhen2, “non-neutral” SNAP and “deleterious” SIFT; Table 2). None of the analyzed non-synonymous SNPs in SULT1A2 showed association with obesity in 355 obesity trios (TDT; Table 3).\n\n In silico predictions vary for the two known synonymous SNPs (rs1690407: p.Ser8 =, rs139896537: p.Ala164 =) and the five non-coding variants (rs4149406: c.148+34T/C, rs3743963: c.500−19T/C, rs710410: c.*7T/C, rs762634: c.*14A>G, rs145790611: c.241+39G/A). For each variant, at least a change in either transcription factor binding sites or splicing enhancer or silencer sites was predicted (S1 Table).\n\nTUFM\n\nIn TUFM, the previously unknown variant c.3536C>G was detected in the 3’ untranslated region (previously unknown). In addition, non-coding intronic variants were detected (rs7187776: c.-55T>C, rs4788099: c.817+13T>C, rs8061877: c.248−18G>A, and rs61737565: c.922+29C>G). All five variants in TUFM are predicted to lead to altered splicing regulator or transcription factor binding sites (S1 Table). For rs8061877, the disruption of a transcription factor binding site was predicted (TFSearch and Consite), although for different transcription factors (SRY, HFH 2, HMG-IY; S1 Table). For the previously unknown variant g.28854194C/G, in silico prediction showed a change in splice enhancer binding sites and splicing silencer sites by three programs (S1 Table). Also, alterations in splice sites for this variant were predicted (Mutation Taster) despite the variant being in the non-coding 3’ UTR of TUFM."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nEstimation of ovarian cancer risks associated with minor alleles of SNPs in inflammation-related genes began with analysis of 162 successfully genotyped SNPs in approximately 900 epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 1,000 controls described in Supplemental Table 1. Twenty-one SNPs (in ALOX15, ALOX5, CCL2, CRP, IL18, IL1A, IL1B, IL6, NOS3, and PTGS1) were associated with risk of ovarian cancer with per-allele p’s < 0.10. Two SNPs were associated at p < 0.01: ALOX5 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) rs1864414 (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64–0.92, p=0.004) and NOS3 (nitric oxide synthase 3) rs743507 (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92, p=0.003). Analyses within ALOX12, CCL11, CCL3, CCR3, CXCL16, IL10, IL15RA, IL1RN, IL4R, IL6R, IL7R, IL8RA, IL8RB, IL9, PTGS2, TLR2, and TNF did not suggest associations between genotype and risk of ovarian cancer (p’s > 0.10). Complete results are provided in Supplemental Table 4.\n\nTwenty-one SNPs with p < 0.10 in discovery analysis were evaluated in an additional approximate 3,100 cases and 2,100 controls described in Supplemental Table 3, and, to enable combined analysis, discovery data were re-analyzed excluding self-reported non-whites and adjusted for only study site. These results and estimates of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r2) are shown in Table 1. Of 21 SNPs in 10 genes, those in IL1A (interleukin 1, alpha) and ALOX5 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) were associated at p-value < 0.01 in combined analysis.\n\nTwo highly-correlated SNPs in IL1A (rs17561 and rs4848300, r2=0.990) yielded essentially identical results, showing associations with decreased risk of ovarian cancer in combined analyses (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.97, p=0.005). Replication analysis yielded p’s < 0.05 (Table 1), and results were consistent between discovery and replication phases (heterogeneity p=0.30; Figure 1). IL1A rs17561 (MAF=0.31) is a missense change (A114S), and rs4848300 (MAF=0.32) resides 3,586 bp from the 3′ end of the gene. As other loosely-correlated IL1A SNPs (r2=0.300) were also associated with ovarian cancer risk (rs3783516 and rs2856838, r2=0.993, OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03–1.18, p=0.01), we attempted logistic regression including all four IL1A SNPs in the combined dataset. However, modeling was uninformative due to convergence issues and unstable parameter estimates.\n\nOf particular interest, analysis of IL1A rs17561 by histological subtype revealed evidence of heterogeneity (p=0.03, Figure 2). Specifically, an inverse association was present for risk of clear cell subtype (p=0.004), mucinous subtype (p=0.02), and endometrioid subtype (p=0.01), yet absent for risk of the more common (54%) serous subtype (p=0.26). Consistently, the risk estimate for tumors with mixed or unknown histology was intermediate to those for rarer subtypes and serous subtype (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75–1.01, Figure 2).\n\nIn combined analysis, the estimated ovarian cancer risk associated with minor alleles at ALOX5 rs1864414 (MAF=0.18, intron 1), one of the strongest initial discovery set signals, was 0.86 (95% CI 0.79–0.95, p=0.002). Results were consistent between discovery and replication datasets (heterogeneity p=0.71), and, with the exception of POL, risk estimates were less than 1.0 in each study (Figure 1). Because a correlated ALOX5 SNP was also associated with ovarian cancer risk (rs745986, r2=0.651, OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–0.97, p=0.01), we included both SNPs in regression modeling. Results suggested that rs1864414 was driving the association (rs1864414 OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75–1.03, p=0.009; rs745986 OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85–1.14, p=0.11). No heterogeneity by histological subtype was observed (p=0.74)\n\nAs shown in Table 1, combined analyses at IL1B (interleukin 1, beta) rs7596684 and PTGS1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1) rs2282169 suggested association with ovarian cancer risk (p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively). Results were null or inconsistent with study phases at SNPs in ALOX15, CCL2, CRP, IL18, and IL6. Among women with available age information, combined analyses adjusting additionally for age yielded similar results at all SNPs."

    "content": "Results\n\nThe population characteristics of childhood ALL cases included in our study were summarized in Table 2. There were 118 cases recruited from Texas Children’s Cancer Center from 2003 to 2010, including 65 males and 53 females. For the study period, the participation rate was 85%. Of the 118 families, 36% were complete triads, however, based on previous assessments this is unlikely to bias the results. The study included individuals of all racial/ethnic groups, 59 non-Hispanic whites, 6 non-Hispanic blacks, 46 Hispanics, and 7 belonging to other racial/ethnic groups. All the cases were under 14 years old when recruited.\n\nWe analyzed 128 tagging SNPs of 16 folate metabolic genes to identify SNPs associated with childhood ALL. The SNPs with posterior probability of inclusion greater than 0.2 in the initial screening within each chromosome proceeded to the final analysis. In the initial screening, 7 SNPs among the 128 tagging SNPs were identified, 2 SNPs in gene MTHFD2, 3 SNPs in gene BHMT2, 1 SNP in gene NOS3, and 1 SNP in gene SLC19A1 (Table 3).\n\nIn the final analysis of 7 selected SNPs from initial screening, NOS3 rs3918186 and SLC19A1 rs1051266 had Bayes factors greater than 1 (Table 4). In other words, the posterior odds of including the two SNPs in the model were greater than the prior odds of including the two SNPs, indicating that our data supported the association between the two SNPs and childhood ALL risk. Specifically, NOS3 rs3918186 had a Bayes Factor of 7.38, whereby for each copy of the minor allele, there was a 2.16 times risk of developing childhood ALL (OR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.51-3.15). We found less evidence in our data for SLC19A1 rs1051266 being associated with childhood ALL. For each copy of the minor allele of SLC19A1 rs1051266, there was a 2.07 times risk of developing childhood ALL (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.25-3.46)."

    "content": "Results\n\nBaseline Characteristics and Genotyping\n\nThe overall study consisted of 108 study participants after exclusions for lack of genotyping consent (n=9) and incomplete genotype data (n=3). Genotyping success rate of the 4 SNPs chosen to define the FADS1/2 haplotype as described in Methods, was between 96.7% and 98.3%. Minor allele frequencies were in the range of 25.0% to 32.9%. The genotype distribution for each SNP did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p >0.05).\n\nBaseline characteristics for the Healthy Eating diet group (n = 54) and the Mediterranean diet group (n = 54) were summarized in Table 1. No significant differences were found in minor allele frequency of any SNP, gender, race, age, or BMI between the two diet groups at baseline. Likewise, baseline measurements of AA, EPA, and long chain n-3 fatty acids (the sum of EPA and DHA) did not differ significantly in the serum or the colonic mucosa between the two diet groups (Table 1).\n\nBaseline measures\n\nLinear regression analysis indicated that the number of minor alleles was a significant predictor of baseline serum AA concentration (p < 0.001) and almost significant for colonic AA concentration (p = 0.058). A greater number of minor alleles was significantly associated with lower AA concentration in serum. Dietary AA intakes were not a significant predictor of either serum of colon concentrations. For long chain n-3 fatty acids, however, the situation was the reverse. Dietary intake of long chain n-3 fatty acids was a significant predictor of baseline serum long chain n-3 concentration (p < 0.001) and colonic long chain n-3 concentration (p = 0.044) while the number of minor alleles was not a significant predictor of either.\n\nSubsequent analyses were done categorizing subjects into two groups by presence or absence of any minor alleles in the FADS gene cluster. The only dietary or demographic factor to differ by genotype at baseline was BMI, which was lower in carriers of any minor alleles (mean of 27.8, SD 3.7, in all major allele carriers and mean of 26.1, SD 3.6, in carriers of any minor alleles, p=0.02 by the 2-sided t-test). Age was not significantly different (p=0.11) but was retained as a covariate. No significant difference was found for other demographic characteristics (race, gender, smoking, common medication use) between minor allele and all major allele carriers. Results were similar when using any one SNP individually versus all minor SNPS (not shown).\n\nSerum and colon fatty acid concentrations at baseline by genotype group are shown in Table 2. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate differences between genotype groups. The presence of any minor alleles was highly significantly associated with baseline serum 20:4, n-6 concentrations (p<0.0001) and 18:3, n-3 concentration (p=0.01), and marginally significant for colonic 20:4, n-6 concentration (p = 0.07), with adjustment for age, BMI, and dietary intakes of n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA and/or long chain n-3 PUFA as a percentage of energy. Specifically, mean serum 20:4, n-6 concentration (% of total fatty acids) for minor allele carriers were estimated to be 2% (95% CI = [1%, 3%]) lower, whereas mean serum 18:3, n-3 concentration for minor allele carriers were estimated to be 21% (95% CI = [4%, 41%]) higher, compared to those individuals with all major alleles in the four SNPs in FADS. There was no significant association of genotype with EPA nor with long chain n-3 fatty acids (the sum of EPA and DHA). Genotype group also had no significant effects on total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, insulin, glucose, and CRP with p>0.11 in each case (not shown).\n\nEffects of Dietary Intervention on Fatty Acid Intakes and Fatty Acid Concentrations in Serum and Colon\n\nWe first evaluated changes in fatty acids by diet group assignment alone without considering the genotype groups. Table 3 displays dietary intakes, serum, and colon fatty acid concentrations for the two diet arms at baseline and after 6 months of intervention. Based on data from food records and 24-hour recalls, dietary intakes of saturated fats (SFA) and monounsaturated fats (MUFA) were significantly reduced (p<0.0001) and long chain n-3 PUFA was significantly increased (p=0.004) in the Healthy Eating group after 6 months. The decrease in mean SFA resulted in an increased polyunsaturated fat: saturated fat ratio from 0.60 to 0.92 in the Healthy Eating group (p=0.008 from mixed linear regression models controlling for age). In the Mediterranean group, dietary intakes of SFA and n-6 PUFA both significantly decreased (p<0.0001), while MUFA and long chain n-3 PUFA significantly increased (p<0.0001), in accord with the counseling goals. The mean polyunsaturated fat: saturated fat ratio increased non-significantly from 0.72 to 0.77 in the Mediterranean group.\n\nSerum 18:2 n-6 significantly decreased (p=0.02), and both MUFA and n-3 PUFA significantly increased (p=0.0005 and p=0.01, respectively) in the Mediterranean arm only (Table 3). There was little change in colon fatty acid concentrations. The only significant change was for long chain n-3 PUFA that significantly increased in both Healthy Eating (p=0.01) and Mediterranean groups (p=0.01).\n\nInteractions of Genotype and Diet Intervention\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show the raw means in each group over time. Table 4 shows the linear mixed model results for the analysis of the genotype by diet interaction. There was a significant interaction of genotype by diet for 20:4, n-6 (AA) concentrations in the colon (p=0.004). No significant genotype-by-diet interactions were found for AA in serum nor for EPA. Among subjects with no minor alleles, mean colon AA concentrations were estimated to be 16% (95% CI = [5%, 26%]) lower for the Mediterranean arm than the Healthy Eating arm at 6 months. These results indicate that after adjusting for baseline AA concentrations, mean colon AA concentrations at 6 months were significantly different between diet arms only in persons with no minor alleles in the FADS1/2 gene cluster. This was mainly due to an increase in colon AA in the Healthy Eating diet arm while colon AA concentrations remained fairly constant in the Mediterranean group."

    "content": "Results\n\nSnoring prevalence and risk factors\n\nOur population-based discovery sample consisted of 408,317 individuals of white British ancestry from the UK Biobank. Participants in the sample were deemed as snoring ‘cases’ (37%) based on their report that a partner or housemate had complained to the participant about their snoring (see Methods and Table 1). Snoring was significantly associated with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.011 [per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.009–1.012]) and, to a greater extent, with sex (ORmales = 2.264 [2.212–2.316]). The prevalence of sleep apnoea was higher within the snorer group (Table 1). Furthermore, BMI, SES, smoking frequency and alcohol consumption frequency were also associated with snoring (Fig. 1a). Although snoring prevalence was higher in males, BMI was positively correlated with snoring prevalence in both males and females (Fig. 1b). A lower SES, as determined by both Townsend deprivation index and average household income, was associated with increased snoring in males only. Smoking frequency was positively correlated with snoring prevalence in females and, to a lesser extent, in males (Fig. 1a–c). In contrast, alcohol consumption frequency was correlated with snoring in males and, to a lesser extent, in females (Fig. 1a–d). We further identified other factors such as whole-body fat mass and sleep duration that are correlated with snoring (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nDiscovery GWAS and SNP heritability\n\nWe performed a GWAS study of snoring, taken as a dichotomous variable (n = 408,317; cases ~152,000; controls ~256,000). After quality control (QC; see Methods), 11,010,159 genetic variants remained in the analysis. This uncovered 127 independent genome-wide significant associations across 41 genomic risk loci (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Annotation for the top 15 risk loci is shown in Table 2 and a list of all genomic risk loci is given in Supplementary Data 1. The overall SNP heritability on the liability scale (h2SNP) was 9.9% (SE = 0.39%).\n\nGenetic correlations\n\nThe trait that showed the highest genetic correlation with habitual snoring was self-reported sleep apnoea (rG = 0.78, SE = 0.17, p-value = 3 × 10−05[ldsc χ2-test]; Supplementary Data 2). We also analysed the genetic correlation between snoring and three measures of overnight oxyhemoglobin saturation: average SpO2, minimum SpO2 saturation and percent of sleep with oxyhemoglobin saturation under 90% (Perc90). Minimum SpO2 and Perc90, which are known proxies for sleep-disordered breathing, but not average SpO2 (which reflects changes in ventilation not necessarily related to sleep apnoea), showed moderate significant genetic correlations with snoring (Fig. 3). Other traits genetically correlated to snoring included BMI, whole-body fat mass, sodium in urine, mood swings, coronary artery disease, alcohol intake frequency, pulse rate, current tobacco smoking, heart disease, lung cancer, the ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), neuroticism, subjective wellbeing and heart rate, among others. Traits showing a negative genetic correlation with snoring included schizophrenia, FVC, FEV1, fluid intelligence score, educational attainment, age at menarche, mean accumbens volume and anorexia nervosa. Overall, traits related to BMI, risk for psychiatric disease, lung function and heart disease were among those with the strongest evidence of association (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 2). Notably, pulse rate, whole-body fat mass and BMI were also phenotypically associated with snoring in this sample (see above and Supplementary Table 1).\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nWe performed two follow-up sensitivity GWAS to explore the effects of BMI, adiposity and nonlinear effects on associated variants. The first sensitivity GWAS included BMI as a covariate, whereas the second included BMI, BMI2, age × sex, age2 and whole-body fat mass. Both sensitivity analyses showed very similar results, with a genetic correlation of 0.9998 (SE = 0.0002). We therefore focus below on the simple model adjusting only for BMI and basic covariates (see Methods). The results revealed 97 genome-wide significant SNPs across 34 genomic risk loci (Fig. 2a) with overall SNP heritability on the liability scale (h2SNP) of 8.67% (SE = 0.39) (Table 3). Although most of the lead SNP effect sizes remained very similar, the signal in the FTO locus showed a strong change after BMI adjustment (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 1). Further, after adjusting for BMI, snoring was no longer genetically correlated with BMI and adiposity-related phenotypes, nor with heart attack, hypertension, alcohol and smoking habits. Traits that remained genetically correlated with snoring after adjusting for BMI included schizophrenia, educational attainment, sodium in urine and sleep-related traits such as daytime dozing, sleep apnoea and excessive daytime sleepiness. Notably, measures of nocturnal hypoxia such as minimum SpO2, average SpO2 and Perc90 showed small increases in their genetic correlation with snoring after adjusting for BMI (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 3). The genetic correlation between both the adjusted and unadjusted GWAS was high (rG = 0.923, SE = 0.003, p-value = 1 × 10−300), suggesting that a considerable amount of snoring predisposition is not fully explained by BMI.\n\nPositional, eQTL and gene-based test prioritization\n\nTo gain insights into the functional consequences of individual genome-wide significant variants, we used positional and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, as well as genome-wide gene-based association analyses. From positional and eQTL mapping, we identified 149 protein-coding genes mapping to a genome-wide significant SNP. The nearest genes to the top signals included DLEU7 on chromosome 13 and MSRB3 on chromosome 12. In addition to DLEU7 and MSRB3, other compelling genes (prioritized by positional or eQTL mapping) for snoring included BCL11B, FTO, SMG6, ROBO2, NSUN3, SNAP91 and BCL2, which have previously been associated with smoking; BLC11B, FTO, RNA5SP471 and SND1 and NSUN3, previously associated with alcohol consumption; FTO and SND1, associated with coffee consumption; LMO4 associated with insomnia; and RNA5SP471 with narcolepsy. In addition, ROBO2 was previously associated with chronotype and multiple genes (DLEU7, MSRB3, FTO, ANAPC4, SMG6, SND1, SIM1, KCNQ5, CEP120, MACF1, SNAP91 and BCL2) previously associated with musculoskeletal traits such as height and heel bone mineral density (Supplementary Data 1 and  2). Genome-wide gene-based association analysis identified 179 genes associated with snoring beyond genome-wide significance (p < 2.636e − 6; Bonferroni-corrected threshold for 18,971 tested genes) several of which were consistent with the mapped genes. After adjusting for BMI, 104 protein-coding genes were identified mapping to a genome-wide significant SNP from the positional and eQTL mapping, whereas 120 genes remained significantly associated with snoring, including both MSRB3 and DLEU7 (see Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2 and 3). eQTL data obtained from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and mapped with Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (FUMA) highlighted significant SNPs that were associated with the expression of genes in several tissues including the lungs, blood, oesophagus, breast mammary, tibial nerve, and several areas of the brain, such as the cerebellum and hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 2). In summary, many of the mapped genes for snoring have been previously associated with other traits and diseases, primarily grouped into cardiometabolic, cognitive/neurological, respiratory and psychiatric (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 1).\n\nTo further assess whether significant genes converged in functional gene sets and pathways, we conducted gene-set enrichment analyses of tissue expression data (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Genes expressed in blood vessel and tibial artery tissue were associated with snoring, even after adjusting for BMI (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Given these associations, and an observed genetic correlation between snoring and pulse rate (rG = 0.106, SE = 0.03, p-value = 0.001), we conducted a two-sample generalized summary-data-based MR (GSMR) to test for a possible causal relationship. The analysis suggested a one-way causal relationship in which snoring increased pulse rate (Supplementary Fig. 4). We further explored the association between snoring and BMI, whole-body fat mass, blood pressure, major coronary heart disease and heart attack. GSMR results suggested a bidirectional causal relationship, with snoring exerting a causal effect on BMI, but also BMI exerting a causal effect on snoring, and a similar pattern was observed for heart attack. In addition, one-way causal relationships were seen for whole-body fat mass causing snoring and for snoring causing an increase in blood pressure (Supplementary Fig. 4). To control for possible confounding due to sample overlap, we conducted GSMR analyses using sex-stratified GWAS results (see Methods). The results supported causal relationships between BMI (and whole-body fat mass) causing snoring, whereas all other associations did not reach statistical significance after controlling for multiple testing (Supplementary Table 2). We performed further sensitivity analyses using five different MR methods that test different assumptions (Fig. 5). The results of GSMR, inverse variance weighted (IVW-MR) and weighted median analyses supported a causal effect of BMI (and whole-body fat mass) on snoring. Notably, although the MR-Egger estimates did not reach statistical significance, the Egger intercept was not significantly different from zero.\n\nSex-stratified GWAS\n\nGiven the higher prevalence of snoring in males, we conducted GWAS analyses stratified by sex. These analyses identified 4 and 25 genome-wide significant SNPs for snoring in males and females, respectively. SNP heritability on the liability scale (h2SNP) was 8.77% (SE = 0.54%) and 12.42% (SE = 0.57%), respectively, for males and females (Table 3). In the sensitivity analyses, SNP heritability (h2SNP) was slightly lower after adjusting for BMI in both males 7.72% (SE = 0.56%) and females 10.85% (SE = 0.54%) (Table 3). We identified two loci (lead SNPs rs199797821 and rs200391180) with a significantly different effect size between sexes, although in the same direction. The cross-sex genetic correlation was high (rG = 0.914, SE = 0.033, p-value = 1.91 × 10−160), and effect sizes and directions for top hits were highly consistent in both the male and female samples (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Fig. 5).\n\nPGS and prediction on an independent sample\n\nWe used the discovery GWAS summary statistics to derive PGS in an independent target sample from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study (AGDS). The prevalence of self-reported recent snoring was 32%, with a higher prevalence in males than in females (43.2% and 28.1%, respectively). PGS for snoring were significantly associated with recent snoring for all but one (p < = 5e − 8) of the p-value inclusion thresholds (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Participants in the highest snoring PGS decile had around twice the odds of reporting recent snoring and choking or struggling for breath during sleep (i.e., probable OSA; sample prevalence = 8.2%) compared with those on the lowest decile (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, the PGS showed a stronger association with increasing frequency of snoring severity (Fig. 6b). Finally, we showed that the snoring PGS explained a significant amount of variance in recent snoring (Fig. 6c)."

Data and p values were adjusted for maternal height (cm), BMI pre-pregnancy (kg/m2), BMI terminal (kg/m2), UVB and weeks of gestation by one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Covariates appearing in the model are evaluated at the following values: BMI pre-pregnancy (kg/m2) = 25.09, BMI terminal (kg/m2) = 29.73 and weeks of gestation = 38.81. No significant difference was observed in any comparisons after adjustment.

    "content": "Results\n\nStudy Subjects\n\nThe biochemical and clinical characteristics of women with PCOS and control subjects are presented in Table 1. Comparable age, menarche, waist-hip ratio, along with lipid profile, total testosterone, LH and FSH levels at examination, were seen between women with PCOS and control women. Significant differences between cases and controls were noted for mean BMI (P <0.001), free testosterone (P = 0.009), bioactive testosterone (P = 0.004), free androgen index (FAI; P = 0.015), fasting insulin (P <0.001), and the insulin resistance index HOMA-IR (P <0.001). Significantly lower levels of SHBG (P <0.001), and higher levels of TSH (P = 0.006) (though within reference range) were noted between women with PCOS and controls. Accordingly, we controlled for these covariates in later analysis.\n\nVEGFA SNPs analysis\n\nA total of 12 VEGFA SNPs were selected for this analysis based on their established MAFs of >5% in Caucasians. MAFs of the 12 tested VEGFA SNPs between women with PCOS and control women are presented in Table 2. All the SNPs conformed to HWE (P <0.005). MAF of rs3025020 (-583T>C) was higher in women with PCOS than control women (0.34 vs. 0.29; P = 9.0 × 10−4). The MAF of other 11 SNPs were not significantly different between women with PCOS and control subjects.\n\nVEGFA Genotype distribution\n\nSignificant difference in rs3025020 (-583T>C), and to a lesser extent rs2010963 (-634C>G) genotype distribution was seen between PCOS cases and control women (Table 3). There was enrichment of homozygous minor allele carrying genotypes -583C/C in PCOS cases (0.14 vs. 0.09), and heterozygous -634C/G genotypes in control women (0.48 vs. 0.37) (Table 3). For the remaining variants, comparable distribution of genotypes was seen among women with PCOS and controls. Taking homozygous major allele genotype as reference, increased risk of PCOS was found to be associated with -583T/C [OR (95% CI) = 1.89 (1.09–3.26)], while reduced PCOS risk was seen with only -634C/G [OR (95% CI) = 0.65 (0.44–0.97)] genotypes, thus assigning PCOS susceptibility and protective nature to these genotypes, respectively.\n\nVEGF serum levels and PCOS features\n\nMean serum VEGF levels were significantly increased (P = 0.007), and reduced (P = 0.048) among rs3025020 and rs2010963 genotype carriers, respectively (Table 4). There was progressive increase in fasting insulin (P = 0.033) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.050), and bioactive testosterone (P = 0.042) in rs3025020 genotype carriers. On the other hand, significant reduction in fasting insulin (P = 0.012), free testosterone (P = 0.007) and bioactive testosterone (P = 0.001) in rs2010963 genotype carriers (Table 4).\n\nCorrelation studies\n\nCorrelation analysis were used to investigate the relationship between VEGFA rs30250202 and rs2010963 genotypes and PCOS-associated features; separate analyses were performed for each of the two VEGFA SNPs (Table 5). In the model including rs3025020, carriage of the minor (C) allele was positively associated with hs-CRP. On the other hand, in the model including rs2010963, there was a negative association between the presence of the minor allele (C) with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), but not with hs-CRP. There was no correlation between either rs3025020 or rs2010963 with the extent of obesity or hypertension, with oligomenorrhea, or with altered levels of (anti-inflammatory) IL-10 or (pro-inflammatory) IL-6 and TNFα."

    "content": "Results\n\nStudy 1\n\nGenotype groups did not differ on self-report measures (Table 1). Replicating prior studies in independent samples (e.g.,), participants successfully modulated their behavior according to reinforcement contingencies; for response bias, a main effect of Block emerged [F(2,344) = 4.16, p = .018] driven by higher response bias in Blocks 3 [mean±SD: 0.19±0.23; t(173) = 3.08, p = .002] and 2 [0.15±0.21; t(173) = 1.80, p = .073] compared to Block 1 (0.12±0.19). Critically, a main effect of Genotype was also found [F(1,172) = 4.77, p = .030, Cohen’s d = 0.38] due to higher response bias in val carriers (0.19±0.15) relative to iso homozygotes (0.14±0.15) (Figure 2). The main effect of Genotype was confirmed when considering Caucasian subjects only [F(1,118) = 4.47, p < .04, Cohen’s d = 0.45], suggesting that findings were not confounded by population stratification. For discriminability, only a trend emerged for Block [F(2,344) = 2.86, p = .064], due to higher discriminability in block 3 (0.85±0.28) and 2 (0.85±0.30) relative to block 1 (0.81±0.29), both ps < .06.\n\nStudy 2\n\nDemographic, self-report, and stress data (Table 2)\n\nGenotype groups did not differ on any demographic or self-report variables. An independent t-test revealed that group differences in shock intensity approached significance, [t(48) = 1.97, p = .055; Cohen’s d = 0.77]; relative to iso homozygotes (2.31±0.90 milliamperes), val carriers selected a lower level of shock intensity to be highly aversive (1.66±0.47 milliamperes). The ANOVA on STAI scores produced main effects of Condition [F(1,51) = 18.17, p < .001] and Time [F(1,51) = 38.28, p < .001]. These main effects were qualified by a Condition × Time interaction [F(1,51) = 12.90, p = .001; Figure 3A]. Post-hoc tests revealed that, as intended, participants reported significantly higher STAI scores during the stress (44.67±9.70) relative to no-stress (39.39±7.16) condition [t(52) = 4.44, p < .001], whereas no significant differences emerged for the pre-stress assessments [no-stress: 34.51±7.11, stress: 35.46±6.96; t(52) = 1.22, p = .23]. Additionally, for both the stress and no-stress condition, STAI scores significantly increased over the course of the experiment, both ts >5.66, both ps < .001. A Time × Condition × Genotype trend emerged [F(1,51) = 3.89, p = .054], but follow-up t-tests revealed no significant differences between genotypes, all ps > .26.\n\nFor PANAS NA, main effects of Condition [F(1,51) =25.13, p < .001] and Time [F(1,51) = 17.42, p < .001] emerged. A significant Condition × Time interaction qualified these main effects [F(1,51) = 17.11, p < .001; Figure 3B]. Participants reported elevated NA scores during the stress (14.63±4.06) relative to the no-stress (12.09±2.39) condition as well as elevated NA scores prior to the stress (11.81±1.77) relative to the no-stress (11.30±1.41) condition, both ts > 2.25, both ps < .03. Additionally, for both the stress and no-stress condition, NA scores significantly increased over the course of the experiment, both ts > 2.75, both ps < .01. In addition, trends for a Time × Condition × Genotype [F(1,51) = 3.65, p = .062] and Time × Genotype [F(1,51) = 2.95, p = .092] interaction emerged. Independent samples t-tests showed, however, no differences between genotype groups, all ps > .15. For PANAS positive affect, no significant effects emerged, all ps > .21.\n\nWhen considering non-specific SC responses, the expected main effect of Condition emerged [F(1,42) = 4.47, p = .04], due to significantly more responses in the stress (4.01±2.58) compared to no-stress (3.32±2.18) condition (Figure 3C). A trending effect for Genotype was observed [F(1,42) = 3.39, p = .07, Cohen’s d = 0.72]; as expected based on prior findings, val carriers (4.56±3.76) had more SC responses than iso homozygotes (2.77±1.91). Collectively, these findings indicate that the stress manipulation was successful; participants reported elevated anxiety and negative affect, and had more non-specific SC responses in the stress relative to no-stress condition. With the exception of a trend for higher skin conductance responses in val carriers, the effects of the stress manipulation were similar across genotypes.\n\nProbabilistic reward task\n\nReplicating prior findings, a significant main effect of Condition emerged for response bias [F(1,51) = 6.32, p = .015], due to reduced response bias toward the more frequently rewarded stimulus in the stress (0.02±0.16) relative to no-stress (0.14±0.16) condition (reported in more detail in). Most importantly, this effect was qualified by a Genotype × Condition interaction [F(1,51) = 5.12, p = .028; Figure 4). Relative to iso homozygotes, val carriers had significantly lower response bias in the stress condition [−0.05±0.16 vs. 0.08±0.15; t(51) = 2.27, p = .03, Cohen’s d = 0.89]. No differences emerged within the no-stress [val carrier: 0.18±0.22 vs. iso homozygote: 0.10±0.15; t(51) = 1.41, p = .16, Cohen’s d = 0.55] condition. In addition, within-group analyses indicated that val carriers tended to have lower response bias in the stress relative to no-stress condition [t(7) = 2.29, p = .056, Cohen’s d = 1.22], while iso homozygotes did not differ between conditions [t(44) = 0.33, p = .74]. Figure 4C displays the distribution of response bias in the stress and no-stress condition for iso homozygotes and val carriers; the correlation between stress and no-stress response bias was not significant in either group (iso homozygotes: r = −.27, p = .07; val carriers: r = −.10, p = .82).\n\nControl analyses\n\nFor discriminability, a main effect of Block emerged [F(2,102) = 3.80, p = .026], due to elevated discriminability in Blocks 3 (0.41±0.02) and 2 (0.40±0.02) relative to Block 1 (0.35±0.02), both ps < .02. Additionally, a Condition × Block × Genotype interaction emerged [F(2,102) = 3.76, p = .027]. Independent t-tests revealed, however, no differences between genotype groups in any block.\n\nFinally, three sets of hierarchical regressions were conducted to confirm that MR genotype differences in response bias were not confounded by differences in discriminability, shock intensity, skin conductance responses, or other genotypes. In all regressions, possible nuisance variables were entered in the first step, MR genotype was entered in the second step, and the difference in response bias between stress and no-stress was entered as the criterion variable. In the first model, discriminability in both conditions was entered in the first step. In the second, shock intensity and skin conductance responses were entered in the first step. Finally, in the third model, three CRHR1 SNPs (i.e. rs12938031, rs10445364, rs4076452) recently associated with stress-induced reward learning deficits were entered in the first step. Findings confirmed that the val allele still explained unique variance of stress-induced response bias reductions after accounting for (1) discriminability [ΔR2 = .09, ΔF(1,49) = 5.08, p = .03], (2) shock intensity and skin conductance responses in both conditions [ΔR2 = .23, ΔF(1,41) = 12.45, p = .001], and (3) CRHR1 SNPs [ΔR2 = .05, ΔF(1,44) = 3.24, p = .08]."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nA total of 2 446 724 SNPs common to both studies were tested for association with ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth at one year’. All analyses were adjusted for gestational age, sex and age, where appropriate (see Materials and Methods). Results from the two studies were combined using fixed effects inverse variance meta-analysis, where effect size estimates are weighted according to the inverse of their standard errors. Q–Q plots indicated little inflation of the test statistics in the individual cohorts and for the meta-analysis overall (‘Age at first tooth’ LAMBDA ALSPAC = 1.04; ‘Age at first tooth’LAMBDA NFBC1966 = 1.05; LAMBDA META = 1.07; ‘Number of teeth’: LAMBDA ALSPAC = 1.02; LAMBDA NFBC1966 = 1.04; LAMBDA META = 1.06) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). The genomic inflation factor λ is well known to increase with sample size; we, therefore, also calculated λ1000 values for the ‘Age at first tooth’ (λ1000 = 1.01) and ‘Number of teeth’ (λ1000 = 1.00) meta-analyses. Both values are consistent with little latent population stratification or other systematic biases affecting our results.\n\nWe identified 10 loci reaching genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) for ‘age at first tooth’ and a further 11 loci for ‘number of teeth’, giving a total of 15 independent loci (Fig. 1). The full GWAS results corresponding to Figure 1 are available from the Human Molecular Genetics website. Table 1 shows the top-ranking SNPs for each phenotype at each locus. Eight of these loci are novel associations; the top SNPs at these loci are rs17563 (BMP4), rs10740993 (CACNB2), rs4937076 (CDON), rs1799922 (CALU/OPN1SW), rs997154 (AJUBA/C14orf93), rs7924176 (ADK), rs412000 (TEX14/RAD51C) and rs9316505 (DLEU7). Four of the loci identified confirm previously reported genes/regions (KCNJ2, MSRB3, IGF2BP1 and EDA). Furthermore, we detected genome-wide significance for the variant rs17101923 in the HMGA2 region (‘number of teeth’ P = 1.1 × 10−10, Table 1), rs10932688 in the 2q35 region and the rs6568401 variant in the 6q21 region, which were identified at suggestive levels of significance in a previous study. We also note that SNPs at the RAD51L1 locus reported as genome-wide significant for association with ‘number of teeth’ in Pillas et al. did not meet the 5 × 10−8 threshold in this study, although there was still suggestive evidence for association at this locus [‘Age at first tooth’ (rs17105278): P = 2.1 × 10−6; ‘Number of teeth’(rs1956529): P = 6.4 × 10−7].  \n\nEach SNP that reached genome-wide significance explained only a small fraction of the overall phenotypic variation in ‘age at first tooth’ (0.05–1.14%, ALSPAC; 0.06–1.45%, NFBC1966) and ‘number of teeth’ (0.09–0.94%, ALSPAC; 0.03–0.92%, NFBC1966). Pooling together the effects of the top SNPs at the genome-wide significant loci (Table 1) into a single allelic score explained 6.06% of the overall phenotypic variation in ‘age at first tooth’ and 4.76% of the variation in ‘number of teeth’. We also report loci displaying suggestive levels of association (Supplementary Material, Tables S1 and S2), 5 × 10−6 > P > 5 × 10−8, which included SNPs in the TMEM9 region that were reported as genome-wide significant in the study of secondary dentition by Geller et al..\n\nSupplementary Material, Figures S2 and S3 show LocusZoom plots of regression analyses for ‘age at first tooth’ and ‘number of teeth’, respectively, at each genome-wide significant locus after meta-analysis. For most loci, there appeared to be evidence of secondary signals independent of the lead SNP at the locus. To quantify the evidence for independent secondary signals, we first calculated the effective number of statistical tests in each region using Nyholt's procedure. For each locus, we estimated the threshold for a family-wise error rate of 5% by dividing alpha = 0.05 by the corresponding number of effective tests in that region, and used this threshold for declaring a secondary signal as significant. These thresholds as well as the strongest P-value in each region after conditioning on the lead SNP are presented in Supplementary Material, Table S3. These analyses showed that there were likely to be independent secondary signals at rs11077486 (KCNJ2 KCNJ160), rs2520397 (FAM155E–EDA), rs1951867 (BMP4), rs1472259 (HMGA2) and rs8069452 (IGF2BP1) for ‘age at first tooth’ and rs9788982 (KCNJ2 KCNJ160), rs2804391 (FAM155E–EDA), rs1458991 (BMP4), rs9894411 (IGF2BP1), rs1976274 (MSRB3) and rs1472259 (HMGA2) for ‘number of teeth’ (Supplementary Material, Table S3).\n\nWe next investigated whether the SNPs at our top loci have pleiotropic effects, specifically whether they are associated with both primary tooth and craniofacial development. A recent GWAS investigated the genetic determinants of 54 measures of craniofacial shape and size recorded in ALSPAC (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). We used these data to test for association between the top SNPs at genome-wide significance and each of the 54 measures of craniofacial development. Because of the large number of correlated craniofacial phenotypes analysed, and consequently the large number of statistical tests performed, we calculated empirical P-values for each SNP permuting each genotype against the 54 phenotypes. This procedure is less conservative than a Bonferroni correction (which assumes that the phenotypes are independent) and ensures that the correlation between phenotypes is properly accounted for in the multiple testing correction. Empirical P-values were calculated for each SNP and those with P < 0.05 were declared significant (Table 2). Using this procedure, we identified three SNPs, which were associated with 10 of the 54 craniofacial measures. Specifically, the SNP rs17101923 (HMGA2) was associated with measurements indexing the width of the upper region of the face and nose (Table 2 and Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Alleles that were associated with increased face width were associated with increased number of teeth and earlier tooth eruption. The rs7924176 marker (ADK) was also associated with measures indexing the width of the nose. Alleles that predisposed to earlier tooth eruption were also associated with a wider nose. Furthermore, rs997154 (AJUBA) was associated with an increase in height and prominence of the mid-brow. \n\nWe also looked up the top SNP from each of the 15 genome-wide significant loci in a previous analysis of secondary dentition and found that 7 were at least nominally associated (P < 0.05) with the number of permanent teeth between 6 and 14 years old (Supplementary Material, Table S4). For the three loci (i.e. HMGA2, BMP4, MSRB3) associated with ‘age at first tooth’ at genome-wide significance, the allele associated with earlier primary tooth eruption was also associated with a greater number of permanent teeth. Furthermore at the four loci (ADK/VCL/AP3M1, 2q35, CACNB2, 6q21) associated with ‘number of primary teeth’, the allele associated with a greater number of teeth at 1 year was also the allele associated with greater number of permanent teeth (6–14 years).\n\nIn order to explore the connection between known height-associated SNPs and teeth phenotypes more deeply, we took 180 robustly associated height variants from the Lango Allen et al. Giant Consortium meta-analysis and examined the degree to which these SNPs were associated with tooth eruption (Supplementary Material, Table S5). Several height-associated SNPs showed strong evidence of association with tooth eruption in the expected direction (i.e. the height increaser allele was associated with faster tooth eruption/more teeth), including rs1351394 in HMGA2 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 5.3 × 10−7; ‘Number of teeth’: P = 1.0 × 10−9), rs12534093 in IGF2BP3 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 0.0026; ‘Number of teeth’: P = 2.7 × 10−5), rs1490384 near C6orf173 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 1.0 × 10−7; ‘Number of teeth’: P = 0.12) and rs1570106 in RAD51L1 (‘Age at first tooth’: P = 0.00012; ‘Number of teeth’: 2.3 × 10−6). Overall, however, the number of height-associated SNPs for which the height increaser allele had a positive effect on faster tooth eruption was not greater than expected by chance (‘Age at first tooth’: 89/180 SNPs in the expected direction P = 0.94; ‘Number of teeth’: 92/180 SNPs in the expected direction P = 0.71). Likewise, a weighted allelic score of height-associated SNPs did not significantly predict the age at first tooth or the number of teeth (‘Age at first tooth’: PMETA = 0.18; ‘Number of teeth’: PMETA = 0.44).\n\nWe also regressed height at 17 years in ALSPAC and at 31 years in NFBC1966 on an allelic score constructed from the genome-wide significant SNPs for ‘Age at first tooth’ and ‘Number of teeth’ listed in Table 1. Allelic scores for ‘Age at first tooth’ (PMETA = 0.0012) and ‘Number of teeth’ (PMETA = 9.8 × 10−4) showed moderate evidence of association with height; however, the associations appeared to be driven largely by variants in HMGA2 and BMP4. After these SNPS were removed from the construction of the scores, the evidence for association attenuated markedly (‘Age at first tooth’ PMETA = 0.11; ‘Number of teeth’ PMETA = 0.04).\n\nFinally, we conducted a pathway analysis using the ALLIGATOR software. In the pathway analyses, an SNP association P-value threshold of 0.005 gave the most significant over-representation of genes in pathways in the ‘age at first tooth’ GWAS (see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Material, Table S6a). The top 20 pathways (of the 2276 considered) from this analysis are shown in Table 3; 11 of these pathways had pathway association P-values <0.001 and the P-value associated with this degree of overrepresentation is 0.004 (Supplementary Material, Table S6A). However, none of the association P-value thresholds applied to the ‘number of teeth’ GWAS resulted in a significant over-representation of pathways (Supplementary Material, Table S6B). In Discussion, we focus on the results from the ‘age at first tooth’ GWAS."

Disease magnitude and quality were monitored through changes in body weight, colon histopathology, and colonic T cell and T cell subset (Th1, Th17, Foxp3+) infiltration (Supplementary Fig. 1). No differences were identified between recipients of WT and IL-10RαTdel T cells, indicating that IL-10 signaling into the transferred T cells does not modulate colitis severity in this T cell-dependent model.\n\nMϕ response to IL-10 restrains T cell-mediated colitis\n\nWe previously demonstrated that macrophage but not DC or T cell IL-10 signaling prominently alleviated inflammation in a distinct T cell-independent, toxin-induced model of acute colitis, DSS colitis. Recent data have also implicated myeloid cells as regulators of disease severity in T cell transfer colitis. To assess the impact of DC and Mϕ-selective deletion of IL-10Rα (IL-10RαDCdel, IL-10RαMdel) in T cell transfer colitis, we generated lineage-specific knock-outs on a Rag1−/− background and induced disease. Histologic and clinical disease did not differ between Rag1−/− and IL-10RαDCdelRag1−/− recipients (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). In contrast, disease was intensified in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Weight loss was elevated and accelerated, with a mean±s.e.m. decrement at 8 wk of 19.1±1.1% vs 9.3±1.1% for Rag1−/− controls (Fig. 1a). IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− colons were shorter than Rag1−/− controls (8.2±0.3 vs 7.1±0.2 cm, Fig. 1b). Histopathology in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− colons demonstrated increased inflammation, with more extensive cellular infiltrates, submucosal edema, and epithelial erosion (Fig. 1c). Total histologic score was 8.3±0.6 and 3.6±0.7 (scale 0–12) for IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− mice respectively. Moreover, fewer IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice survived with extended disease times (Fig. 1d), and these developed an elevated incidence of rectal prolapse (75% IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice vs 0% Rag1−/− controls at 12 wk).\n\nIn a recent study, mice deleting IL-10R using a CX3CR1-driven Cre that is expressed by a large proportion of LPMϕs developed spontaneous colitis. We did not observe overt spontaneous disease in our IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice during the time frame of our assays. To further assess this, cohorts of these and IL-10Rαfl/flRag1−/− controls (n=10 for each) were aged for 6 months. There was no difference in weight gain, or presence of clinical signs of colitis or other illness in either population (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Histologic analysis of 5 aged IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice failed to identify evidence for colitis. Similarly, spontaneous colitis was not observed in 6 month aged IL-10RαMdelRag1+/+ mice.\n\nIL-10’s protective role in colitis is well established. To determine whether the Mϕ-specific response to IL-10 can account for this, we also compared disease in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice with Rag1−/− mice harboring a germline deletion in IL-10Rα (IL-10Rα−/−Rag1−/−; Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). No difference in clinical disease or histopathology was evident in these two recipient lines, implying that IL-10-mediated immunoprotection can largely be accounted for by its Mϕ-specific effects.\n\nThe Lys-M-Cre transgene used to ablate IL-10Rα in the IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice is expressed in granulocytes as well as Mϕs. Neutrophils have a modest protective role in T cell transfer colitis, and loss of IL-10Rα signaling there, rather than in Mϕs, may have impacted disease. To isolate the Mϕ-specific effect, we depleted neutrophils with specific Ab beginning prior to T cell transfer. Neutrophils were undetectable in the peripheral blood from αLy6G Ab but not control Ab treated animals throughout the experimental interval. In Rag1−/− recipients, weight loss was mildly increased on some disease days in neutrophil-depleted mice, though no significant difference in histopathology was identified (Fig. 1e, f). No significant change in disease severity was apparent with neutrophil depletion in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice. Further, the prominent disease exacerbation in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− compared with Rag1−/− recipients persisted after neutrophil depletion, indicating that the intensified immunopathology in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice is primarily attributable to the Mϕ rather than granulocyte IL-10 response.\n\nIncreased numbers and activation of IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− LPMϕs\n\nTo identify causes of the enhanced IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− disease, we first analyzed lamina propria macrophages (LPMϕs). LPMϕs, typed as CD11bhiCD11c−/lo/modF4/80+Ly6G−/loSiglecF−, were significantly increased in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice with colitis compared with Rag1−/− controls (Fig. 2a). This population was uniformly CD64+ and predominantly CX3CR1+, further delineating them as LPMϕs (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The cells were further characterized by a uniformly elevated surface expression of activation markers, including CD40, CD80, and CD86 (Fig. 2b). Segregation of CD11b+CD64+CD103− and CD45+ cells based on Ly6C and class II MHC expression can distinguish pro-inflammatory (Ly6Chi) and anti-inflammatory (Ly6Clo) macrophage populations. Most LPMϕs analyzed using this alternative gating strategy were phenotypically pro-inflammatory, and the proportions of Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo macrophages did not differ between IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice and Rag1−/− controls (Supplementary Fig. 3b).\n\nThe increased IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− versus Rag1−/− LPMϕ numbers were further associated with an increased proliferation rate, as determined by incorporation of the nucleotide analog BrdU. Unlike for LPMϕs, no differences in BrdU incorporation were evident in colonic CD4 T cells, DCs, and neutrophils, or in Mϕs from other locations (Fig. 2c). Therefore, numbers, proliferation, and activation state of LPMϕs are increased in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice.\n\nUnimpaired IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− T regulatory response\n\nA subset of T cells transferred into Rag1−/− mice upregulate Foxp3, and IL-10 signaling into Mϕs could contribute to the generation and maintenance of these regulatory T cells. Indeed, recent findings with IL-10Rβ−/−Rag2−/− mice have identified defective iTreg formation and Treg function. Treg co-transferred with naïve T cells even at a 1:1 ratio were incapable of preventing disease. To assess Treg activity here, we quantified Foxp3+ iTreg forming in the LP, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and spleen of IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and control Rag1−/− colitic mice. No differences were observed (Fig. 3a). We next analyzed whether sorted Treg transferred into IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− mice with the induction of colitis could prevent disease. The transferred cells were able to fully suppress disease development in both IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− recipients, indicating that a macrophage-specific defect in IL-10 response does not overtly impact Treg suppressive activity in this setting (Fig. 3b). Treg transfers led to a >2-fold increase in Treg in the spleens, MLNs, and colons of recipient mice and Treg percentages did not differ between IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− recipients in any of the locations (Fig. 3c). These results indicate that Treg are able to suppress disease in the absence of a macrophage-specific response to IL-10, and that Treg-specific mechanisms independent of IL-10 actions on macrophages are employed in this system.\n\nAlternative regulatory T cell populations are demarcated by IL-10 production, and IL-10 itself may impact these directly or indirectly. To evaluate this, we induced colitis by transferring naïve T cells from IL-10-GFP knock-in reporter mice. Here too, no differences in population sizes were seen (Fig. 3d). To determine if T cell IL-10 production was itself functionally dispensable for the differential colitis in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice, we performed transfers using IL-10−/− or WT T cells. Disease severity, measured clinically and histologically, was exclusively associated with recipient type. IL-10 production by transferred T cells did not influence disease magnitude clinically or histologically (Fig. 3e, f). Therefore, the Mϕ IL-10 response does not identifiably impact regulatory T cell presence. Further, while Mϕ response to IL-10 is critical in attenuating disease, T cells are not a significant source of this IL-10 here.\n\nPro-inflammatory cytokine production by IL-10RαMdel LPMϕs\n\nTo further evaluate the heightened disease severity in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice, we measured in whole colons the levels of cytokines implicated in its pathogenesis, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-γ. With early disease (wk 4), IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1 were increased in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− colon compared with Rag1−/− controls (Fig. 4a). As disease progressed (wk 8), the quantity of cytokine produced was altered. Additional elevations in IL-17 and TNF-α were identified at this time. Differences in IL-10 and IFN-γ were not seen.\n\nT cell transfer colitis is associated with colonic infiltration by both Th1 and Th17 cells, and the Th17 response is required for disease development. Our identification of increased colonic IL-6 and IL-1β in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice, cytokines associated with Th17 induction, coupled with elevated IL-17 but not IFN-γ levels implied an intensification of the Th17 response. To test this, we enumerated IFN-γ and IL-17 producing T cells in the colonic infiltrate. Significantly increased percents and absolute numbers of CD4+IL-17A+ T cells were identified in IL-10RαMdel Rag1−/− compared with Rag1−/− colons (Fig. 4b). Likewise, after the induction of disease with CD4+CD25−CD45RBhi RORγT-GFP reporter T cells, increased GFP+ T cells were identified in the colon at 4 and 8 wk (Supplementary Fig. 4a). No differences in CD4+IFN-γ+ T cell quantities were evident (Fig. 4c).\n\nTo more specifically determine whether elevated production of Th17-promoting cytokines was specific to the Mϕ population, we sorted colonic CD11bhiCD11c−/lo/modF4/80+Ly6G−/loSiglecF− LPMϕs from colitic mice and assayed their cytokine expression profiles by qRT-PCR. A particularly prominent elevation in IL-1β production was apparent in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− compared with Rag1−/− LPMϕs (mRNA expression ratio: 7.5±1.2). Lesser elevations in IL-6 (3.4±0.5), IL-23 (2.9±0.3) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines were also identified (Fig. 4d, e). IL-10 itself was unchanged and a modest decline in arginase with a corresponding increase in iNOS further indicated enhanced pro-inflammatory function of the IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− LPMϕs. For IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23p19, and iNOS, relative expression was compared in sorted colonic LPMϕs, DCs, neutrophils, and epithelial cells (Fig. 4d). Elevated expression was specific to the Mϕs, indicating that Mϕs are the primary source for the increased Th17-associated cytokines and implying that IL-10 acts directly on these cells to suppress their production.\n\nAs an alternative gating strategy, we also sorted CD11b+CD64+CD103−CD45+Ly6Chi LPMϕs and assessed similarly for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23, IL-10, iNOS, and arginase. These were differentially expressed in a manner paralleling results above (Supplementary Fig. 4b). CD163 was additionally assessed as a marker for anti-inflammatory macrophages and found to be similar in the IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and control Rag1−/− populations.\n\nColitis in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice is Th17 dependent\n\nTh17 cells have been shown to be essential to T cell transfer colitis in Rag1−/− mice. The elevated colonic inflammation in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice was correlated with an increased Th17 response, but may also have been mediated by alternative pathologic pathways. To verify a role for Th17 cells, we transferred RORγT−/− T cells into Rag1−/− and IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients (Supplementary Fig. 5). RORγT, and hence Th17 cells, proved essential for colitis in both recipient types.\n\nColitis is IL-6 independent in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice\n\nThough IL-6 is well established as a key inducer of Th17 cells, its isolated role in fostering the Th17 response fundamental to T cell transfer colitis has not been addressed. The increased IL-6 in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice might have driven the increased immunopathology there. To assess this, we induced colitis by transfers of IL-6Rα−/− or WT naive T cells into IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− recipients. IL-6Rα−/− T cells were ineffective in inducing disease in Rag1−/− mice (Fig. 5a, b). Mice gained weight after T cell transfer and histologic lesions were mild. In contrast, IL-6Rα−/− and WT T cells proved equipotent in mediating severe clinical disease in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients. Although there was a trend toward modestly diminished histologic severity after IL-6Rα−/− transfer, this was not significant. Thus, the Mϕ response to IL-10 creates a dependency for IL-6 in disease pathogenesis.\n\nTo better understand this, we analyzed the T cell responses leading to colonic injury. Th17 cell percentages among CD4+TCR+ T cells were reduced in the MLNs of mice receiving IL-6Rα−/− T cells (Fig. 5c). This was true for both IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− mice. Thus IL-6Rα signaling supports but is not essential for Th17 formation in the MLNs of both of these recipient lines. In the colon, the representation of Th17 cells was significantly decreased in Rag1−/− but not IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients. This indicates a relative expansion of Th17 cells at the site of autoimmune inflammation specifically in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice.\n\nAbsolute numbers of Th17 cells in all organs sampled dramatically differed between Rag1−/− and IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients of IL-6Rα−/− T cells. Few Th17 cells were present in the spleens, MLNs, and colons of Rag1−/− recipients, whereas large numbers were present in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients (Fig. 5c). This difference reflected a pervasive decrease in total T cell number with the IL-6Rα−/−→Rag1−/− transfers (Fig. 5d). Therefore, IL-6 is broadly necessary for T cell expansion and colitis in Rag1−/− but dispensable in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice. IL-10’s actions on Mϕs generate an IL-6 requirement for autoinflammatory disease and robust T cell expansion.\n\nIn contrast to Th17 development, no differences were identified in the proportions of Th1 or Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells in any of the transfer combinations tested, indicating that T cell IL-6 and Mϕ IL-10 responses do not similarly skew these maturation pathways (Fig. 5e, f). However, absolute numbers of Th1 and Foxp3+ cells were diminished in the IL-6Rα−/− →Rag1−/− combination, again reflecting the impaired T cell expansion in the absence of disease development.\n\nIL-1 response is required for IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− colitis\n\nIL-1β plays an essential role in the steady-state development of intestinal Th17 cells in healthy mice and further promotes the Th17 response during colitis. Considering this, the lack of a requirement for IL-6 in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice (Fig. 5a, b), and the dramatically elevated IL-1β expression in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− LPMϕs (Fig. 4), we hypothesized that IL-1β plays a pathologic role in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice that is able to supersede the IL-6 requirement for colitis. To test IL-1’s impact, we induced colitis by transferring IL-1R−/− T cells into IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− recipients.\n\nIL-1R−/− T cell transfers into Rag1−/− mice did not lead to the virtually complete disease protection seen after IL-6Rα−/− T cell transfers. However IL-1R−/− →Rag1−/− transfers did show diminished clinical and histologic measures of colitis compared with control WT T cell transfers (Fig. 6a, b). IL-1R−/− T cells also provoked significantly milder disease than WT T cells In IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− recipients (Fig. 6a, b). This contrasts with IL-6Rα−/− T cells, which did not detectably alter disease severity. Therefore, while T cell IL-6 responsiveness is clinically important only in Rag1−/− colitis, T cell IL-1 response modulates both Rag1−/− and IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− disease.\n\nWe performed similar analyses of the impact on T cell responses after IL-1R−/− transfers as for the IL-6Rα−/− transfers above. Whereas a decreased percent and absolute number of Th17 cells was seen in the MLNs, a site of T cell priming, after IL-6Rα−/− transfers (Fig. 5c), no differences in the MLNs were seen for IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− or Rag1−/− recipients receiving IL-1R−/− compared with WT T cells (Fig. 6c). However, substantially diminished proportions and absolute numbers of Th17 cells were seen in the colons of mice receiving IL-1R−/− T cells. The actions of IL-1 were specific to Th17 effectors; no differences were identified in Th1 and Foxp3+ Treg populations (Fig. 6d, e). This indicates that there is a selective defect in the Th17 response in the colon. T cell IL-1 but not IL-6 response in IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice promotes colonic inflammation by supporting Th17 cells at the site of autoinflammatory disease. In Rag1−/− mice, where IL-10 suppresses LPMϕ IL-1β production, IL-6 plays a more critical role.\n\nIl-10 inhibits pro-IL-1β production and maturation\n\nOur data indicated that IL-1β, increased in the colon of IL-10RαMdel mice, supports the pathologic Th17 response mediating colitis. IL-10 inhibits this IL-1β production thereby attenuating disease. To determine whether IL-1β protein in the colon is primarily produced by LPMϕs, we used immunohistochemistry to colocalize IL-1β and CD11b in colon sections from diseased IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and Rag1−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 6a). This demonstrated that IL-1β is largely associated with the CD11b+ population.\n\nIL-1β is generated from an inactive cytosolic precursor (pro-IL-1β). Caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β, converting it into its active form which is then released from the cell. Caspase-1, in turn, is activated by inflammasome stimulation. To better evaluate the impact of IL-10 signaling on IL-1β production by LPMϕs, we first quantified pro-IL-1β levels by flow cytometry in gated CD11bhiCD11c−/lo/modF4/80+Ly6G−/loSiglecF− Mϕs. This demonstrated a 1.7-fold elevation in the percent of LPMϕs expressing pro-IL-1β in the colons of diseased IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− compared with Rag1−/− mice (mean±s.d.: 84.6±6.0% vs 48.6±8.4%; Fig. 7a). Further, the MFI of positive cells from IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice was nearly 2-fold greater than that from control mice (131.4±9.3 vs 76.6±5.7). In contrast to the colons of diseased mice, pro-IL-1β levels were low to undetectable in MLN and bone marrow macrophages, and levels did not differ between IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− mice and Rag1−/− controls. Differences in pro-IL-1β were also not apparent in mice in which disease was not induced (Supplementary Fig. 6b).\n\nWe verified that pro-IL-1β was directly regulated in Mϕ by IL-10, analyzing its production in cultured and LPS and ATP-stimulated Mϕ by Western analysis, and simultaneously assessing for mature IL-1β formation (Fig. 7b and Supplemenatary Fig. 7). Substantially lower amounts of both pro-IL-1β and IL-1β were present in cultures of Rag1−/− than IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− Mϕ. After treatment with IL-10, pro-IL-β was diminished and mature IL-1β undetectable in Rag1−/− cultures, while this manipulation had no effect on IL-10RαMdelRag1−/−-derived Mϕs. In contrast, treatment with blocking anti-IL-10R antibody elevated Rag1−/− pro-IL-1β and IL-1β levels to those seen with IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− Mϕs.\n\nThe complete suppression of IL-1β maturation by IL-10 suggested that Mϕ IL-10R signaling also suppressed caspase-1-activation. To test this we assessed for caspase-1 cleavage to its activated form. LPS and ATP stimulation of Rag1−/− Mϕs led to a modest increase in activated caspase-1 (p20, Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Pre-treatment of Rag1−/− Mϕs with IL-10, however, abrogated this induction. In contrast, pre-treatment with anti-IL-10Rα Ab markedly increased activated caspase-1, indicating that autocrine IL-10 normally restrains caspase-1 activation. In the IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− Mϕs, p20 formation was similarly increased regardless of IL-10 or anti-IL-10Rα Ab treatment.\n\nTo determine whether increased IL-1 and IL-6 from LPMϕs can also directly impact Th17 cell maturation, we sorted LPMϕs from diseased IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− and control Rag1−/− mice, and co-cultured them with naïve T cells in the presence of added TGFβ but not IL-6. Some Th17 formed in the presence of Rag1−/− LPMϕs, however, this was markedly elevated with IL-10RαMdelRag1−/− LPMϕs (Fig. 7c). Addition of αIL-6Rα blocking antibody largely abrogated Th17 formation with Rag1−/− LPMϕs. However, consistent with our in vivo findings after IL-6R−/− T cell transfer, this effect was modest with IL-10RαMdelRag1−/−-derived LPMϕs. Blocking IL-1 signaling led to more substantial inhibition of Th17 development in IL-10RαMdel Rag1−/−-derived LPMϕs and inhibition of signaling by both cytokines essentially abrogated Th17 formation. Therefore, IL-10 can act on LPMϕs to directly impair their support of Th17 production. This occurs through the downregulation of IL-1 and to a lesser extent IL-6."

    "content": "Results\n\nLandscape of microbiome composition across cohorts\n\nOur study included cohorts that were heterogeneous in terms of ethnic background, age, male/female ratio and microbiome analysis methodology. Twenty cohorts included samples of single ancestry, namely European (16 cohorts, N=13,266), Middle-Eastern (1 cohort, N=481), East Asian (1 cohort, N=811), American Hispanic/Latin (1 cohort N=1,097) and African American (1 cohort, N=114), whereas four cohorts were multi-ancestry (N=2,571) (see Supplementary Note, Supplementary Tables 1,2).\n\nTwenty-two cohorts comprised adult or adolescent individuals (N=16,632), and two cohorts consisted of children (N=1,708). The microbial composition was profiled by targeting three distinct variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene: V4 (10,413 samples, 13 cohorts), V3-V4 (4,211 samples, 6 cohorts) and V1-V2 (3,716 samples, 5 cohorts) (Fig. 1a). To account for differences in sequencing depth, all datasets were rarefied to 10,000 reads per sample. Next, we performed taxonomic classification using direct taxonomic binning instead of OTU clustering methods (see Online Methods).\n\nIn general, cohorts varied in their microbiome structure at multiple taxonomic levels (Fig. 1b–g). This variation may largely be driven by the heterogeneity between populations and differences in technical protocols (Supplementary Tables 1–3). Combining all samples (N=18,340) resulted in a total richness of 385 genus-level taxonomic groups that had a relative abundance higher than 0.1% in at least one cohort. This observed total richness appears to be below the estimated saturation level (Fig. 1b), suggesting that a further increase in sample size and a higher sequencing depth are needed to capture the total gut microbial diversity (Fig. 1d). As expected, the core microbiota (the number of bacterial taxa present in over 95% of individuals) decreased with the inclusion of additional cohorts (Fig. 1c, Online Methods). The core microbiota comprise nine genera, of which seven were previously identified as such, plus the genera Ruminococcus and Lachnoclostridium (Fig. 1e). Of these nine genera, the most abundant genus was Bacteroides (18.65% (SD:8.65)), followed by Faecalibacterium (6.19% (SD:2.35)), Blautia (3.36% (SD:2.84)) and Alistipes (3.05% (SD:1.47)). Among the European cohorts that compose the largest genetically and environmentally homogeneous cluster, the core microbiota also included Ruminiclostridium, Fusicatenibacter, Butyricicoccus and Eubacterium, genera which typically produce short-chain fatty acids.\n\nThe DNA extraction method was the principal contributor to heterogeneity, with a non-redundant effect size of 29% on the microbiome variation (measured as average genus abundance per cohort; stepwise distance-based redundancy analysis R2adjDNAext=0.27, Padj=7×10−4) (Supplementary Table 4). Richness and Shannon diversity also differed significantly across cohorts. The cohorts with the lowest richness (HCHS/SOL) and highest diversity (DanFund) used specific DNA extraction kits that were not used by other studies, possibly contributing to their outlying alpha diversities (Fig. 1f,g, Supplementary Table 3). Overall, the 16S rRNA domain sequenced and the DNA extraction methods used, together with cohort ethnicity, accounted for 32.74% of richness variance.\n\nGiven the high heterogeneity of microbial composition across cohorts, we applied both per-cohort and whole study–filters for taxa inclusion in GWAS (see Online Methods).\n\nHeritability of microbial taxa and alpha diversity\n\nWe performed estimation of heritability (H2) of gut microbiome composition based on the two twin cohorts included in our study (Supplementary Table 5). The TwinsUK cohort, composed of 1,176 samples, including 169 monozygotic (MZ) and 419 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, was used to estimate H2 using the ACE (additive genetic variance (A)/shared environmental factors (C)/non-shared factors plus error (E)) model. The Netherlands Twin Registry (NTR) cohort (only MZ twins, N=312, 156 pairs) was used to replicate the MZ intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). None of the alpha diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson and inverse Simpson) showed evidence for heritability (A<0.01, P=1). Among the 159 bacterial taxa that were present in more than 10% of twin pairs, 19 taxa showed evidence for heritability (Pnominal<0.05) (Fig. 2a). The ICC shows concordance between TwinsUK and NTR for these 19 bacterial taxa (R=0.25, P=0.0018, Fig. 2b).\n\nThe SNP-based heritability calculated from mbQTL summary statistics using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression showed two bacterial taxa, genus Ruminiclostridium 9 and family Peptostreptococcaeae, passing the significance threshold given the number of 211 taxa tested (Z<3.68, Supplementary Table 5). The results of the SNP-based heritability and twin-based heritability showed significant correlation across the tested taxa (R=0.244, P=7.2×10−4).\n\nThirty one loci associated with gut microbes through GWAS\n\nFirst, we studied the genetic background of the alpha diversity (Simpson, inverse Simpson and Shannon diversity indices). We identified no significant hits in the meta-GWAS (P>5×10−8; Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Fig. 1), which is in line with the observed lack of heritability for these indices.\n\nNext, we used two separate GWAS meta-analysis approaches to explore the effect of host genetics on the abundance levels (mbQTL) or presence/absence (mbBTL) of bacterial taxa in the gut microbiota (see Online Methods).\n\nIn total, 18,340 samples and 211 taxa were included in the mbQTL mapping analysis (Online Methods, Supplementary Table 3). We identified genetic variants that mapped to 20 distinct genetic loci associated with the abundance of 27 taxa (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. 2,3; Supplementary Table 7, 8). MbBTL mapping covered 177 taxa, and 10 loci were found to be associated with presence/absence of bacterial taxa (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 7, 9). For one taxon, family Peptococcaceae, two independent mbBTLs were detected (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 7). Two out of 30 mbTLs showed heterogeneity in mbTL effect-sizes (Supplementary Note).\n\nIn both the mbQTL and mbBTL mapping, only one out of 31 loci (LCT locus – Bifidobacterium, P=8.63×10−21) passed the strict correction for the number of taxa tested (P<1.95×10−10 for 257 taxa included in the analysis). However, the remaining loci include functionally relevant variants (i.e. the FUT2 gene suggested by earlier studies) and, overall, showed concordance with the heritability of microbial taxa. Seven out of the nine taxa that showed the strongest evidence for heritability in the TwinsUK cohort (P<0.01) also have genome-wide significant mbTLs (Fig. 2b). For the taxa with genome-wide significant mbTLs, the number of independent loci associated with a relaxed threshold of 1×10−5 strongly correlated with heritability significance (R=0.62, P=1.9×10−4, Fig. 2c), suggesting that more mbTLs would be identified for this group of bacteria using a larger sample size.\n\nLCT mbQTL effect shows age and ethnic heterogeneity\n\nThe strongest association signal was seen for variants located in a large block of about 1.5Mb at 2q21.3, which includes the LCT gene and 12 other protein-coding genes. This locus has previously been associated with the abundance of Bifidobacterium in Dutch, UK and US cohorts. Previous studies have also shown a positive correlation of Bifidobacterium abundance with the intake of milk products, but only in individuals homozygous for the low-function LCT haplotype, thereby indicating that gene–diet interaction regulates Bifidobacterium abundance. In our study, the strongest association was seen for rs182549 (P=1.28×10−20), which is a perfect proxy for the functional LCT variant rs4988235 (r2=0.996, D’=1 in European populations). This association showed evidence for heterogeneity across cohorts (I2=62.73%, Cochran’s Q P=1.4×10−4). A leave-one-out strategy showed that the COPSAC2010 cohort, which includes children 4–6 years of age range, contributed the most to the detected heterogeneity (Fig. 4a,b; Supplementary Table 2). When this study was excluded from the meta-analysis, the heterogeneity was reduced (I2=51.9%, Cochran’s Q P=0.004). A meta-regression analysis showed that linear effects of age and ethnicity accounted for 11.84% of this heterogeneity. Including quadratic and cubic terms of age in the model explained 39.22% of the heterogeneity, and the residual heterogeneity was low (Cochran’s Q P=0.01) (Fig. 4c).\n\nFollowing these observations, we decided to investigate the effect of age and ethnicity in the multi-ethnic GEM cohort, comprising 1,243 individuals with an age range between 6 and 35 years, of which nearly half of the participants are 16 years or younger. Our analysis showed a significant SNP–age interaction on the level of Bifidobacterium abundance (P<0.05, see Online Methods). Individuals homozygous for the NC_000002.11:g.136616754CC (rs182549) genotype showed a higher abundance of the genus Bifidobacterium in the adult group, but not in the younger group (Fig. 4d). The age–genotype interaction was significant in the GEM_v12 and GEM_ICHIP subcohorts, both comprising mostly European individuals, while the GEM_v24 cohort, mainly composed of individuals of different Israeli subethnicities (see Online Methods) who live in Israel, showed neither an mbQTL effect (Beta = −0.002 [95%CI: −0.21, 0.21]) nor an interaction with age (P>0.1). The lack of an LCT mbQTL effect in adults was also observed in another Israel cohort in the study (Personalized Nutrition Project (PNP), 481 adults, Beta = −0.20 [95%CI: −0.61, 0.20]). Altogether, the cohorts that reported the lowest LCT effect sizes were the two cohorts of Israeli ethnicity volunteered in Israel (GEM_v24, PNP) and a child cohort (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC), Beta = −0.18 [95%CI: −0.36, −0.01]).\n\nmbTLs are enriched for genes related to metabolism\n\nSeveral loci detected at genome-wide significance level were enriched for genes related to metabolism.\n\nIn the mbQTL analysis, the FUT2-FUT1 locus was associated to the abundance of the Ruminococcus torques genus group, a genus from the Lachnospiraceae family. The leading SNP (rs35866622 for R. torques group, P=2.21×10−8) is a proxy for the functional variant rs601338 (r2=0.8; D’=0.9 in European populations) that introduces a stop-codon in FUT2. Another proxy of the functional FUT2 SNP, rs281377, showed association to the Ruminococcus gnavus genus group in the binary analysis, however this signal was just above the genome-wide significance threshold (P=5.79×10−8) (Supplementary Table 9). FUT2 encodes the enzyme alpha-1,2-fucosyltransferase, which is responsible for the secretion of fucosylated mucus glycans in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Individuals homozygous for the stop-codon (rs601338*A/A, non-secretors) do not express ABO antigens on the intestinal mucosa. We observed that the tagging NC_000019.9:g.49218060C>T (rs35866622 non-secretor) allele was associated with a reduced abundance of the R. torques group and a decreased presence of the R. gnavus group. Ruminococcus sp. are specialized in the degradation of complex carbohydrates, thereby supporting a link between genetic variation in the FUT2 gene, levels of mucus glycans and the abundance of this taxa. When assessing the link between this variant and phenotypes in the LifeLines-DEEP (LLD; N=875) and Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP, N=2,259) cohorts (Online Methods), the strongest correlation for the R. torques group was seen with fruit intake (LLD: RSp=−0.19, Padj=3.1×10−5; FGFP: RSp=−0.10, Padj=1.4×10−4, Supplementary Table 10, 11), in line with the association of FUT2 with food preferences, as discussed in the results of the PheWAS (see below).\n\nSeveral other suggestive mbQTLs can be linked to genes potentially involved in host–microbiome crosstalk. One of them includes three SNPs in 9q21 (top-SNP rs602075, P=3.57×10−8) associated with abundance of Allisonella. The 9q21 locus includes the genes PCSK5, RFK and GCNT1, of which RFK encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and GCNT1 encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in biosynthesis of mucin. These products play major roles in the host–microbiota interactions within the intestine, where they are used by bacteria for their metabolism and involved in the regulation of the host immune defense. Another association signal 10p13 (rs61841503, P=9.8×10−9), which affects the abundance of the heritable family Peptostreptococcaceae, is located in the CUBN gene, the receptor for the complexes of cobalamin (vitamin B12) with gastric intrinsic factor (the complex required for absorption of cobalamin). CUBN is expressed in the kidneys and the intestinal epithelium and is associated with B12-deficient anemia and albuminuria. Cobalamin is required for host–microbial interactions, and supplementation with cobalamin induced a substantial shift in the microbiota composition of an in vitro colon model. These associations suggest that some members of the gut microbiome community might be affected by genetic variants that regulate the absorption and metabolism of vitamins B2 and B12.\n\nAmong mbBTLs, the strongest evidence for association was seen for a block of 10 SNPs (rs7574352, P=1.42×10−9) associated with the family Peptococcaceae, a taxon negatively associated with stool levels of the gut inflammation markers chromogranin A (LLD: RSp=−0.31, Padj=4.4×10−18, Table S10) and calprotectin (LLD: RSp=−0.11, Padj=0.058) and with ulcerative colitis (FGFP: RSp=−0.06, Padj=0.09, Table S11). The association block is located in the intergenic region in the proximity (220kb apart) of IRF1, which is involved in insulin resistance and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.\n\nOther highlights of identified mbTLs are given in the Supplementary Note.\n\nGSEA, FUMA and PheWAS analysis\n\nTo explore the potential functions of the identified mbTLs, we performed FUMA (Functional Mapping and Annotation of GWAS, see Online Methods), GSEA and PheWAS, followed by Bayesian colocalization analysis and genetic correlation of Bifidobacterium abundance to its PheWAS-related traits. FUMA of 20 mbQTL loci returned 139 positional and eQTL genes. GSEA on these genes suggested an enrichment for genes expressed in the small intestine (terminal ileum) and brain (substania nigra and putamen basal ganglia) (Supplementary Fig. 4). The positional candidates for mbBTLs did not show any enrichment in GSEA analysis.\n\nTo systematically assess the biological outcomes of the mbTLs, we looked up the 31 mbTLs in the summary statistics for 4,155 complex traits and diseases using the GWAS ATLAS. Five out of 31 leading SNPs were associated with one or more phenotypes at P<5×10−8 (Supplementary Table 12): rs182549 (LCT) and rs35866622 (FUT1/FUT2), followed by rs4428215 (FNDC3B), rs11647069 (PM FBP1) and rs9474033 (PKHD1).\n\nThe variant showing highest pleiotropy, rs182549 (LCT, Bifidobacterium), was associated with multiple dietary and metabolic phenotypes, and the causal involvement of the SNP across pairs of traits was confirmed by colocalization test (PP.H4.abf > 0.9) for 49 out of 51 tested phenotypes. The NC_000002.11:g.136616754=(rs182549) allele, which predisposes individuals to lactose intolerance, was negatively associated with obesity and positively associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosis (OR=1.057 [95%CI:1.031, 1.085], P=1.74×10−5), family history of T2DM (paternal: OR=1.054 [95%CI:1.035, 1.073], P=1.41×10−8; maternal: OR=1.035 [95%CI:1.016, 1.053], P=0.0002, siblings: OR=1.03 [95%CI:1.009, 1.052]), and several nutritional phenotypes in the UK Biobank cohort. Moreover, the functional LCT SNP rs4988235 variant is associated with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (P=4.23×10−28), an indicator of glycemic variability. There was a nominally significant correlation of Bifidobacterium with raw vegetable intake (rg=0.36, P=0.0016), but this correlation was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.\n\nNC_000019.9:g.49218060=(rs35866622, FUT1/FUT2 locus) was positively associated with fish intake and height. The secretor allele was negatively associated with the risks of cholelithiasis and Crohn’s disease, alcohol intake frequency, high cholesterol and waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted for body mass index (BMI), with PP.H4.abf > 0.9).\n\nConsistent with the single SNP analysis, gene-based PheWAS also showed a strong link of the LCT locus with metabolic traits (e.g. P=5.7×10−9 for BMI), whereas several nutritional (e.g. P=1.26×10−20 for oily fish intake), immune-related (e.g. P=1.73×10−12 for mean platelet volume), gastrointestinal (e.g. P=8.77×10−14 for cholelithiasis) and metabolic signals (e.g. P=1.13×10−13, high cholesterol) mapped to the FUT1/FUT2 locus (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 13).\n\nFinally, we performed a phenotype domain enrichment analysis (Online Methods). We observed that top loci were enriched with signals associated with the metabolic domain supported by 4 mbTLs, followed by nutritional, cellular, immunological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, respiratory and reproductive traits, and the activities domain (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 14).\n\nMendelian Randomization analysis\n\nTo identify the potential causal links between gut microbial taxa and phenotypes, we performed bi-directional two-sample MR analyses using the TwoSampleMR package. We focused on two groups of phenotypes: diseases (autoimmune, cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric) and nutritional phenotypes. The complexity of the mechanisms by which host genetics affect microbiome composition, and the limited impact of genetic variants on microbial taxa variability, require caution when performing and interpreting causality estimation using MR analysis. We therefore carried out several sensitivity analyses and excluded any results that showed evidence of being confounded by pleiotropy (Online Methods). Only pairs supported by three or more SNPs were considered. With these strict cut-offs, no evidence for causal relationships between microbiome taxa and dietary preferences was identified (Supplementary Tables 15, 16). However, our results suggest that a higher abundance of the class Actinobacteria and its genus Bifidobacterium may have a protective effect on ulcerative colitis (Actinobacteria: OR=0.56 [95%CI: 0.44–0.71] for each SD increase in bacterial abundance, PBHadj=8.8×10−4; Bifidobacterium: OR=0.51 [95%CI: 0.39–0.71], PBHadj=9.8×10−5) (Fig. 6a,b). We also observed that higher abundance of family Oxalobacteraceae has a protective effect on rheumatoid arthritis (OR=0.82, [95%CI: 0.74–0.91], PBHadj=0.028, Fig. 6c)."

    "content": "Results\n\nThe subcohort consisted of 12,722 participants with an average age of 52 (SD 9) years and 61.6% was female. In EPIC-InterAct, median milk intake was 162 (p25-p75 27-300) g/day and non-consumption of milk was rare (7.1%) (Table 1). Milk intake differed between countries, ranging from 15 (0-150) g/day in France to 200 (107-307) g/day in the United Kingdom. Non-consumption of milk ranged from 47.6% in France to 0% in Denmark (Supplemental Table 2-5).\n\nPrevalence of homozygous LP (rs4988235 T/T genotype) differed within Europe with a range from 7.4% in Italy to 53.9% in Sweden (Supplemental Table 6). LP SNP genotypes were in HWE in the total subcohort, but deviation from HWE at a p<0.05 significance level was observed in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark (Supplemental Table 6). Baseline characteristics of the subcohort by rs4988235 genotype showed that with increasing number of LP (T) alleles, participants were older, had a higher systolic blood pressure, were more physically active and highly educated (Supplemental Table 7). Also consumption of dairy products, potatoes, margarine, sugar, non-alcoholic beverages and coffee was higher, whereas intake of pasta/rice, cereal products, fruit, vegetables, legumes and vegetable oils was lower (Supplemental Table 8).\n\nrs4988235 and intake of dairy products and other foods\n\nAfter adjustment for sex, age, principal components, study centre and genotyping platform, one additional LP allele was associated with a higher intake of milk (β 17.1 g/day, 95%CI 10.6 to 23.6) and milk beverages (β 2.8 g/day, 95%CI 1.0 to 4.5), but not with intake of other dairy products (Table 2). F statistic of the model predicting milk intake was 74.0, and predicting a composite endpoint of milk and milk beverages intake decreased the F statistic to 64.5.\n\nrs4988235 was associated with higher plasma C15:0 (β 0.003 % of total fats, 95%CI 0.0005 to 0.005). A similar association was suggested for C17:0 levels (β 0.002 % of total fats, 95% CI -0.0007 to 0.005), but this was not statistically significant.\n\nrs4988235 and diabetes risk factors\n\nrs4988235 was associated with a modestly lower HDL cholesterol (β -0.017, 95%CI -0.029 to -0.004). After multivariable adjustment, dietary intakes associated with rs4988235 were potatoes (β 3.0, 95%CI 0.9 to 5.1), cereal (β -3.5, 95% CI -6.7 to -0.3), fruits (β -7.0, 95%CI -12.4 to -1.7), poultry (β -0.8, 95%CI -1.4 to -0.2), non-alcoholic beverages (β -18.0, 95%CI -34.4 to -1.6) and wine (β -4.8, 95%CI -9.1 to -0.6) (Table 2). rs4988235 was not associated with energy intake.\n\nrs4988235 and risk of diabetes and MR analysis\n\nrs4988235 was not associated with baseline HbA1c levels (β -0.07 %, 95%CI -0.22 to 0.07, n=12,519), nor with risk of developing diabetes (HRper additional LP allele 0.99, 95%CI 0.94,1.04). MR analysis suggested no association between milk intake and diabetes (HR 0.99per 15 g/day, 95%CI 0.93 to 1.05, I2 = 44%) (Table 4, Supplemental Figure 2).\n\nResults did not differ when repeating the IV analysis among 10,000 bootstrap samples (HRper 15 g/day 0.99, 95%CI 0.94 to 1.04) and assuming a dominant effect of LP did not alter conclusions (HRper 15 g/day 0.99, 95%CI 0.92-1.07). Restricting analysis to participants genotyped on the Illumina Human Quad 660 chip did not change conclusions, nor did excluding 73 participants with an HbA1c> 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or limiting analysis to countries in HWE (Supplemental Table 9)."

    "content": "Results\n\nSample Characteristics\n\nThe treatment and placebo arms did not differ in social class or maternal education, verbal and nonverbal intellectual competence, perceived stress, depression, or nutritional status (Table 1). About 30% of both groups were poorly nourished based on their dietary caloric intake, and more than 70% did not meet the AI for dietary choline intake. There were no group differences in alcohol consumption, which was very heavy for both groups at time of conception (≈10.0 standard drinks/occasion on an average of 2–3 days/week). Women in both arms continued to drink heavily across pregnancy (≈8–9 drinks/occasion) but reduced their frequency to about 1–2 days/week. Both groups smoked about ¼ pack/day on average, and cigarettes/day was only slightly higher among those in the choline group. Use of illicit drugs other than marijuana was rare; none of the women reported using cocaine, heroin, or methaqualone. Although women who used methamphetamine were excluded at time of recruitment, 4 reported using it later in pregnancy (2 choline, 2 placebo). There were no group differences in weeks gestation at time of booking, initial screening, or randomization or duration of choline supplementation. Weeks gestation at randomization ranged from 8.6–26.0 (Median=20.0); duration of choline supplementation ranged from 9–27 weeks (Median=18.6). The groups differed on sex of infant, with more girls in the choline and more boys in the placebo arm. There were no group differences in infant age at the 6.5- and 12-month assessments.\n\nEyeblink Conditioning\n\nAmong the 48 infants with usable EBC data, a larger proportion of the choline group met criterion for conditioning compared with the placebo group, although the effect fell short of conventional levels of statistical significance (Table 2). When the four infants whose mothers’ adherence was very poor (<20%) were excluded from the analysis, the effect was significant despite the smaller sample size; two-thirds of choline-treated infants met criterion for conditioning, compared with only one-third of the placebo group. When percent CRs in the two arms was examined across the three sessions, there was a main effect for session, F(2,60)=32.66, p<0.001, but not for treatment, F(1,30)=0.19, p>0.20 (Fig. 4). The infants in the choline arm showed a significantly greater increase in percent CRs across the three sessions than the placebo group (group by session interaction, F(2,60)=4.85, p<0.01.\n\nThe relation between protocol adherence and percent CRs in Session 3 for the choline treatment group is shown in Figure 5. An analysis of Mahalanobis distance identified one bivariate maternal outlier (p<0.007) with very poor adherence and high percent CRs. When that outlier was removed from the analysis, there was a clear linear relation between degree of adherence and conditioning by Session 3, r=0.63, p<0.01. By contrast, adherence was not related to percent CRs in the placebo group, r=−0.14, p>0.20.\n\nGestational Age and Somatic Growth\n\nThe majority of the women (93.7%) had full-term pregnancies, and GA did not differ between groups (Table 3). Although low birthweight (<2500 g) was common (26.1%), the incidence (choline 25.0%, placebo 32.3%) was similar between arms, χ2(1)=0.41, p=0.524. There were also no significant group differences in birth size. With the exception of length in the placebo group, birth percentile measures were markedly below the 50th percentile, likely due to the high levels of alcohol to which this cohort was exposed.\n\nAmong infants in the placebo arm, z-scores and percentiles for weight, length, and head circumference decreased from birth to 6.5 months (Table 3), which is consistent with our previous studies in Detroit and Cape Town that found worsening of fetal alcohol growth restriction in the 1st year of life. By contrast, infants in the choline arm demonstrated considerable catch-up growth in weight and head circumference by 6.5 months, which continued to be evident at 12 months. In repeated measures analyses examining the percentiles, the choline group showed significantly greater increases across this age period than the placebo group in weight, F(2,116)=4.85, p=0.009, and head circumference, F(2,116)=5.40, p=0.006. Group differences were not significant for the raw weight (kg), length (cm), and head circumference (cm) measures, presumably because the choline arm contained a higher proportion of females, who tend to be smaller than males.\n\nFagan Test of Infant Intelligence\n\nInfants in the choline treatment arm performed more optimally on the FTII than placebo infants at 12 months, with higher novelty preference scores, indicating better visual recognition memory function (Table 4). The Cohen’s d measure indicates a moderate-to-large effect size. The moderate effect size for the processing speed measure suggests that this effect might be significant in a larger sample.\n\nFASD Diagnosis\n\nWithin the choline arm, 8 infants met criteria for FAS and 2 for PFAS (32.3%), compared with 5 who met criteria for FAS and 2 for PFAS (22.6%) in the placebo arm, χ2(1)=0.73, p=0.393.\n\nImpact of Maternal Dietary Choline Status\n\nOnly 9.7% (3 choline-treated, 3 placebo) of the 62 infants assessed in this study were born to mothers whose dietary choline intake during pregnancy was adequate (>450 mg/day), and none exceeded the UL of 3.5 g/day. 21.6% of the infants (6 choline-treated, 5 placebo) were born to mothers who carry the rs12325817 variant of the enzyme PEMT, which reduces endogenous choline synthesis. The six outcomes on which the choline and placebo groups differed were examined. None of the choline group by maternal PEMT allele interactions were significant (all ps>0.20)."

The four groups did not significantly differ in terms of age and gender (P>0.05). However, waist circumference, BMI, SBP, DBP, FPG, and 2 h PG increased with the abnormal increase in blood glucose (IFG and IGT groups) and continued to increase with the blood sugar until it reached T2DM levels. The clinical parameters significantly differed between the four groups (all P<0.05).\n\n(CA)n polymorphism in rs10886471\n\nCA repeat sequences are abundant in the human genome. Numerous studies have revealed that intronic (CA)n repeats could play a novel and generally important role in the splicing of enhancers or repressors during gene expression. Therefore, we extended the rs10886471 SNP analysis to study the short tandem repeat (STR) function. Genomic DNA from 1164 subjects was amplified via PCR and sequenced using primers specific for the rs10886471 studied region (about 320 bp) as shown in  Figure 1  and  2 ).\n\n(CA)n allelic frequencies of rs10886471\n\nThe allelic frequencies are listed in  Figure 3  and  Table 2 , (CA)17 had the highest allelic frequency in each group, followed (CA)16. However, the allelic frequencies of (CA)16 and (CA)17 were lower in the NFG group than in the IFG, IGT, and T2DM groups. The allelic frequencies of (CA)15, (CA)18, and (CA)19 in the NFG group were higher than those in the IFG, IGT, and T2DM groups. The allelic frequency of (CA)16 was significantly lower than that of (CA)17, but significantly higher than those of (CA)18 and (CA)19 among the four groups (χ2 = 16.190, P = 0.001; χ2 = 10.221, P = 0.017; and χ2 = 8.265, P = 0.041, respectively). The allelic frequency distributions of (CA)15, (CA)17, (CA)18, and (CA)19 did not significant differ among the four groups [(CA)15 (χ2 = 0.570, P = 0.903); (CA)17 (χ2 = 6.096, P = 0.107); (CA)18 (χ2 = 1.368, P = 0.713); (CA)19 (χ2 = 3.889, P = 0.274), respectively]. By contrast, the frequency of (CA)16 increased with the abnormally increasing blood glucose (IFG and IGT groups) and continued to increase with blood sugar until it reached T2DM levels. The allelic frequencies of (CA)16 in the IFG, IGT, and T2DM groups were much higher than in the NFG group (χ2 = 12.300, P = 0.000; χ2 = 13.672, P = 0.000; χ2 = 14.476, P = 0.000, respectively).\n\nThe PIC values of the rs10886471 (CA)n alleles\n\nThe PIC values of the rs10886471 (CA)n alleles in the NFG, IFG, IGT, and T2DM groups were 0.6146, 0.6233, 0.6291, and 0.6327, respectively. The PICs of the four groups all exceeded 0.5, which indicates that the GRK5 (CA)n repeats exhibited genetic polymorphism. The PIC of each group did not significantly deviate from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nAssociation of GRK5 (CA)n polymorphisms with prediabetes and T2DM\n\nLogistic regression analysis was conducted on the alleles and the results are presented in  Table 2 . The NFG group was designated as the control group, whereas the three remaining groups were designated as the case groups and classified as dependent variables (NFG = 0, IFG = 1, IGT = 2, and T2DM = 3). Each allele was classified as an independent variable. The statistical significance of the inclusion criteria was set to P>0.05, whereas that for the exclusion criteria was set to P<0.10.  Table 2  shows the association of intronic (CA)n repeat polymorphisms with prediabetes and T2DM risk. Using the most common (CA)17 allele as a reference for estimating the strength of the association, allele (CA)16 was significantly associated with increased risk of prediabetes and T2DM [IFG, OR (95% CI) = 1.938 (1.289–2.915), P = 0.001; IGT, OR (95% CI) = 2.021(1.347–3.034), P = 0.001; T2DM, OR (95% CI)  = 2.012 (1.345–3.009), P = 0.001, respectively]. The other alleles were not significantly associated with abnormal blood glucose (P>0.05). The NFG group was designated as the control group, whereas the other three groups were designated as the case groups. All alleles without (CA)16 that included (CA)15, (CA)17, (CA)18, and (CA)19 were classified as one multiple allele. The (CA)16 allele was used as a reference. The multiple alleles were negatively correlated significantly with the IFG, IGT, and T2DM groups [IFG, OR (95% CI)  = 0.510 (0.347–0.750), P = 0.001; IGT, OR (95% CI)  = 0.492 (0.336–0.721), P = 0.001; T2DM, OR (95% CI)  = 0.484 (0.331–0.708), P = 0.000, respectively]."

Use of NSAIDs and selenium supplements was similar between cases and controls. Intakes of calcium and dietary fiber were lower in cases than controls. Most cases were diagnosed with cancer in the colon (81.1%). Given that our participants were recruited from 40 different WHI clinical centers across the United States, the range of serum selenium concentrations was wide (81.0-398.7 μg/L); however, the mean concentrations were relatively high (135.6 ± 21.1 μg/L in controls).\n\nSerum selenium concentration was not associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (p for trend = 0.10); the adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for colorectal cancer risk comparing the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th quintiles of serum selenium concentrations with the 1st quintile were 1.13 (0.82-1.56), 1.16 (0.84-1.59), 1.34 (0.98-1.84) and 1.26 (0.91-1.73), respectively (Table 2).

There were no statistically significant interactions of serum selenium with age (p for interaction = 0.41), smoking (p for interaction = 0.12), and postmenopausal hormone use (p for interaction = 0.29).\n\nOnly one SNP in GPX4 gene (rs8178974) was statistically significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk (p for trend = 0.02); however, the overall variation in GPX4 gene was not associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (global p = 0.20) (Supplementary Table and Supplementary Figure 1). All other SNPs, either tested individually or combined within a gene, were not associated with colorectal cancer risk. When stratified by White and African-Americans, results generally did not differ from the overall analyses. Genetic variants in selenoenzymes did not modify the association between serum selenium and colorectal cancer (global p for interaction = 0.09 to 0.87, Supplementary Figure 2).\n\nMeta-Analysis\n\nThe meta-analysis showed a statistically significant inverse association between selenium and colorectal tumor risk (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.71-0.92) (Figure 1); however, results were heterogeneous (I2 = 59.5%; p = 0.001). Similar results were obtained after excluding the two clinical trials (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.70-0.92, I2 = 60.4%, p = 0.001). When stratified by gender, selenium was significantly and inversely associated with colorectal tumor risk in men (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.57-0.82) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 16.7%; p = 0.29) (Figure 2). Among women, there was no association (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.79-1.18), but results remained heterogeneous (I2 = 49.5%; p = 0.045). The protective association was stronger for studies that measured selenium after colorectal tumor diagnosis compared with those that measured selenium before diagnosis (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.47-0.80, vs. OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.76-1.02); however, this did not explain the heterogeneity between studies (Supplementary Figure 3A). The inverse association between selenium and colorectal tumors was limited to studies measuring selenium in serum/plasma (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.68-0.90) and there was no association in studies measuring selenium in toenails, although only three studies were included (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.70-1.44) (Supplementary Figure 3B). The inverse association was stronger for colorectal adenoma (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.57-0.85) than cancer (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.76-1.06; Supplementary Figure 3C). Based on visual inspection of funnel plots, there was potential evidence for publication bias, with a slightly higher number of small studies reporting inverse associations (Supplementary Figures 4A-C), which is in the expected direction."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nCard9−/− mice are more susceptible to colitis\n\nRecovery is impaired in Card9−/− mice after dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, as compared to that in WT mice, with delayed weight gain and greater histopathologic alterations (Supplementary Fig. 1). Epithelial cell proliferation is reduced and apoptosis is increased, as shown by decreased staining for the proliferation marker Ki67 and increased staining for cleaved caspase 3, respectively, confirming impaired intestinal healing (Fig. 1a,b). To examine the mechanisms responsible for this defect, we compared the colon transcriptomes of wild-type (WT) and Card9−/− mice before and during DSS-induced colitis. The mouse transcriptomes clustered according to genotype (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The number of upregulated genes on day 7 was higher in Card9−/− mice than in WT mice. Pathway analyses of the induced transcripts showed a dominance of immune-related pathways, corresponding to a stronger signal in Card9−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b). During the recovery period (day 12), the pathways involved in cell proliferation and replication were more activated in WT mice than in Card9−/− mice, confirming the healing defect in Card9−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The most induced and differentially expressed genes between Card9−/− and WT mice on days 7 and 12 were regenerating islet-derived 3 gamma (Reg3g; encoding REGIII-γ), Reg3b (encoding REGIII-β) and interleukin 1beta (Il1b) (Fig. 1c). The expression of antimicrobial proteins, such as REGIII-γ and REGIII-β, by intestinal epithelial cells is induced by IL-22 (ref.). Moreover, IL-17A has a protective role in concert with IL-22 (ref.). As assessed by real-time qPCR, colonic expression of Il22, Reg3g, Reg3b, and Il17a was decreased on day 12 in Card9−/− mice (Fig. 1d). In the colon lamina propria, the percentage of IL-22+ cells was decreased in Card9−/− mice on days 0 and 12 (Fig. 1e). Among these cells, the CD3−CD4−NKp46− subset was reduced on day 12 in Card9−/− mice (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 3). These results highlight the role of CARD9 and its effector IL-22 in mediating recovery from DSS-induced colitis. The major role of IL-22 and its target genes Reg3g and Reg3b in the response to bacterial and fungal infections raises questions about the specific role of the microbiota in the hyper-susceptibility to colitis that is observed in Card9−/− mice.\n\nThe gut microbiota is altered in Card9−/− mice\n\nWe next explored the composition of the microbiota at the fungal and bacterial level at baseline and during colitis (Fig. 2). In Card9−/− and WT mice, the colonic fungal load reached a peak at day 7, but it was higher in Card9−/− mice (Fig. 2a). Little is known regarding the diversity of the gut fungal microbiota and how fungi contribute to colitis in mice. We therefore further analyzed the fungal microbiota in feces via high-throughput internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the basis of genus composition revealed major differences between WT and Card9−/− mice at days 0 and 7. The fungal composition in Card9−/− mice was altered at days 0, 7, and 12, whereas it changed only slightly with colitis in WT mice, showing more resilience to DSS-induced perturbation (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4a). Diversity measurements also suggested increased resilience of the fungal microbiota in WT mice than in Card9−/− mice (Fig. 2c). The fungal microbiota of WT and Card9−/− mice was dominated by members of the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) pipeline, we observed several differences in the baseline fecal fungal microbiota composition in Card9−/− mice, as compared to that in WT mice (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 4b). In line with the PCA results, the composition of the fungal microbiota was more altered at days 7 and 12 in Card9−/− mice than in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 5). In parallel, we explored the composition of the fecal bacterial microbiota by using 16S rDNA sequencing. Although the alterations were less marked than for the fungal microbiota, PCA revealed that the baseline bacterial microbiota was different in WT and Card9−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Moreover, the shift in the composition of the bacterial microbiota during colitis followed a similar pattern in WT and Card9−/− mice, but with decreased stability in Card9−/− mice (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Fig. 4c,d). No differences were observed regarding biodiversity between WT and Card9−/− mice at any of the time points (Fig. 2g). The LEfSe analysis revealed differences at baseline, including decreases in Adlercreutzia (genus), Actinobacteria (phylum), and Lactobacillus reuteri in the Card9−/− mouse microbiota (Fig. 2h). In WT mice, there was a negative correlation between bacterial and fungal biodiversity (Fig. 2i), suggesting an inter-kingdom relationship and possibly competition. In contrast, a positive correlation was observed in Card9−/− mice, suggesting abnormal interactions within the gut ecosystem between bacteria and fungi, with possible consequences on gut homeostasis (Fig. 2i). Overall, these data demonstrate that CARD9 has a role in shaping the bacterial and fungal gut microbiota and that it is required to control fungal microbiota expansion in colitis.\n\nThe Card9−/− microbiota has pro-inflammatory effects\n\nTo isolate the effect of the gut microbiota, we colonized WT germ-free (GF) mice with the microbiota of WT (WT→GF) or Card9−/− (Card9−/−→GF) mice and exposed them to DSS. The microbiota transfer was sufficient to recapitulate the phenotype observed in Card9−/− mice, as evidenced by increased susceptibility to colitis and impaired recovery, with decreased epithelial cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (Fig. 3a–d and Supplementary Fig. 6a). However, the fungal component of the microbiota did not seem to be involved in this effect, as fungal levels were similar in WT→GF and Card9−/−→GF mice, and antifungal treatment did not modify the phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 6b–d). To decipher the mechanisms leading to the defective recovery from DSS-induced injury in Card9−/−→GF mice, we assessed the colonic expression levels of 179 inflammation-associated genes using NanoString technology (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Il22 was one of the most highly downregulated genes in Card9−/−→GF mice, as compared to those in WT→GF mice (Fig. 3e), in addition to the chemokine-encoding genes Cxcl1 and Cxcl5 and the transcription-factor-encoding gene Fos, all of which are known IL-22 target genes in epithelial cells. IL-22 has been implicated in intestinal homeostasis, and it mediates innate antimicrobial resistance in mice. Furthermore, similar to Card9−/− and Card9−/−→GF mice, Il22−/− mice are more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis and show impaired healing during the recovery period. Therefore, we postulated that a deficient IL-22 response may underlie impaired recovery of Card9−/−→GF mice during DSS-induced epithelial injury. In agreement with the NanoString results, Il22 expression in the colon was decreased in Card9−/−→GF mice on days 0 and 12 (Fig. 3f). Moreover, the expression levels of Reg3g and Reg3b were reduced in Card9−/−→GF mice, as compared to those in WT→GF mice at days 0 and 7 (Fig. 3f). In contrast, no differences were detected in the expression of Il17a (Fig. 3f) or defensin beta 1 (Defb1), which is a target of IL-17A (Supplementary Fig. 7a). We next confirmed the IL-22 defect in Card9−/−→GF mice at the protein level in the colon and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) at baseline, day 7 and day 12 (Fig. 3g,h). We found no differences in the amounts of IL-17A, IL-6, IFN-γ, or IL-10 in the MLN or colon (Fig. 3g,h and Supplementary Fig. 7b,c), suggesting that the IL-22 axis is specifically impaired in Card9−/−→GF mice. No differences in IL-22 amounts were observed in splenocytes, suggesting a gut-limited defect in Card9−/−→GF mice (Supplementary Fig. 7d). Several sources of IL-22 have been identified in the gut, including innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), natural killer cells, T helper 17 (TH17) and TH22 cells, γδ T cells, and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. Following isolation of intraepithelial and lamina propria cells, we observed that IL-22 production by TH22, NKp46+ ILCs, LTi cells, and CD3−CD4−NKp46− cells was decreased in the colon lamina propria of Card9−/−→GF mice, as compared to that in the colon lamina propria of WT→GF mice on day 12 (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Fig. 8). In contrast, IL-17 production was not altered, and no difference was observed in IL-22 or IL-17 production by intraepithelial γδ T cells (Supplementary Figs. 8c and 9). Intestinal dendritic cells and macrophages, which are involved in the stimulation of IL-22-producing cells via IL-23 production, were also explored, but no differences were observed between Card9−/−→GF and WT→GF mice (Supplementary Fig. 10). These data indicate that the microbiota of Card9−/− mice is defective in inducing IL-22 production by T cells and ILCs in the colon, leading to impaired recovery from DSS-induced colitis.\n\nImpaired tryptophan metabolism in Card9−/−→GF mice\n\nOur results suggest that the gut microbiota of Card9−/− mice contributes to susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis by altering IL-22 production. One mechanism that could link these findings is the modulation of AHR activation by the microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract. Tryptophan can be metabolized either by the gut bacteria into indole derivatives, such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or by host cells into kynurenine (Kyn) via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1; Supplementary Fig. 11a). Indole derivatives are AHR ligands (Supplementary Fig. 11b) known to promote local IL-22 production. Therefore, by examining the levels of AHR ligands in the lumen of the colons of germ-free, Ido1−/−, Card9−/−, Card9−/−→GF, WT, and WT→GF mice, we were able to analyze tryptophan metabolism by the host and the gut bacteria. As expected, production of Kyn was impaired in Ido1−/− mice, whereas normal IAA levels were observed. Production of IAA was impaired in GF mice, and Kyn levels were also low, probably because of the underdevelopment of the gut immune system (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 11c,d). Most notably, the levels of IAA in Card9−/−→GF and Card9−/− mice were decreased, whereas the bacterial concentrations within the colons were not modified (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 11c–e), indicating that the change in the microbiota in Card9−/− mice was responsible for the low level of IAA. In line with these data, culture supernatants of L. reuteri and Allobaculum sp., two bacteria with decreased abundance in the Card9−/− mouse microbiota (Fig. 2h), strongly activate AHR (Supplementary Fig. 12a). These results suggest that impaired tryptophan metabolism by the microbiota of the Card9−/− mice could be associated with, or even be responsible for, the hypersusceptibility of Card9−/− mice to colitis.\n\nUsing an AHR reporter system, we found that feces from Card9−/− and Card9−/−→GF mice were defective in their ability to activate AHR, to a similar extent as that for feces from GF mice (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 12b). To assess the in vivo importance of this finding, we administered 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (Ficz), an AHR agonist, to DSS-exposed mice. The severity of colitis (body weight loss, histology score, and colon shortening) was reduced in Card9−/− and Card9−/−→GF mice that were treated with Ficz, as compared to their untreated counterparts during recovery, reaching the level of severity seen in WT or WT→GF mice (Fig. 4c–e and Supplementary Fig. 12c–e). Accordingly, defects in the colonic expression of Il22, Reg3g, and Reg3b in Card9−/− and Card9−/−→GF mice were rescued by Ficz administration (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 12f). This effect was also observed at the protein level for IL-22 in the colon (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 12g). Moreover, supplementation of Card9−/−→GF mice with three Lactobacillus strains, isolated from WT mice for their ability to activate AHR (Fig. 5a,b), rescued susceptibility of Card9−/−→GF mice to colitis, IL-22 expression, and AHR ligand production (Fig. 5c–j). These effects were mediated by AHR, as they were abrogated in the presence of an AHR antagonist (Fig. 5e–j).\n\nOne study showed that the microbiota of Il22−/− mice is altered, and its transfer increases susceptibility of WT mice to colitis. Therefore, we postulated that a deficient IL-22 response may also be involved in the decreased production of AHR ligands by the microbiota. Indeed, microbiota from Il22−/− mice had impaired AHR activity and decreased levels of IAA (Supplementary Fig. 13a,b). Moreover, administration of exogenous IL-22 was sufficient to normalize AHR ligand production and colitis susceptibility in Card9−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 13c–h). These results show that the gut microbiota of Card9−/− mice contributes to the susceptibility of the mice to colitis by altering the IL-22 signaling pathway via impaired tryptophan metabolism, leading to defective AHR activation. In addition, IL-22 is required for the production of AHR ligands by the microbiota (Supplementary Fig. 14). An AHR agonist can effectively counter these defects.\n\nReduced AHR activity and tryptophan metabolites in subjects with IBD\n\nWe explored whether these findings were relevant to human disease and analyzed fecal samples from individuals with IBD (Supplementary Table 1) and healthy subjects for their ability to activate AHR. The fecal samples from healthy subjects induced greater activation of AHR than those from patients with IBD (Fig. 6a). This defect was observed in both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (Supplementary Fig. 15a). This finding was associated with decreased levels of tryptophan and IAA, and increased levels of Kyn, in the fecal samples from patients with IBD (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 15b–d). Therefore, activated immune cells in the gut of individuals with IBD may use tryptophan to produce Kyn via IDO1, whereas the metabolism of tryptophan by the gut microbiota is impaired, leading to defective AHR activation. We next searched for a connection between CARD9 and the ability of the microbiota to produce AHR ligands in humans. We genotyped patients with IBD for an IBD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within CARD9 (rs10781499) and found that the risk allele was associated with reduced AHR activation by microbiota-derived metabolites extracted from fecal samples in our in vitro assay (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 15c,d). No association was observed among other major IBD-associated SNP-containing alleles of genes, including NOD2, autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1), and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) (Supplementary Fig. 15e). These results should be confirmed in an independent cohort but suggest a connection between IBD, CARD9, and the ability of the microbiota to produce AHR agonists in humans."

    "content": "Results\n\nBaseline characteristics:\n\nSummary demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample (mean age 49 years, 54% women) are shown in Table 1 according to β2M quartiles and in Table S1 for the overall study sample.\n\nCross-sectional analyses:\n\nBaseline β2M concentration was positively associated with prevalent hypertension after adjusting for clinical covariates with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.24, P=0.003) per standard deviation increase in log-transformed β2M, and an OR of 1.29 (95% CI 1.05–1.57, P=0.01) for the top versus bottom β2M quartile (Table 2).\n\nLongitudinal analyses:\n\nA total of 886 (21%) participants who were normotensive at baseline developed new-onset hypertension after a mean follow-up of six years. Results of the GEE model revealed a significant association between baseline β2M and risk of new-onset hypertension with an OR of 1.18 (95% CI 1.07–1.32, P=0.001) per standard deviation increase in log-transformed β2M (Table 3). Results of the quartile analysis showed that the top β2M quartile had a 1.59-fold risk (95% CI 1.20, 2.11, P=0.001) of incident hypertension versus those in the bottom quartile (Table 3). Excluding individuals with albuminuria and low eGFR at baseline did not materially change the results (Table S2).\n\nReclassification Analyses:\n\nReclassification metrics revealed that β2M improved the prediction of new-onset hypertension over the clinical model, which consisted of the following baseline covariates: age, sex, study cohort, BMI, diabetes, cigarette smoking, levels of total and HDL-cholesterol, statin-use, eGFR, and systolic and diastolic BP. Addition of β2M to the clinical model improved the discrimination for new onset hypertension in the overall sample (integrated discrimination improvement [IDI] 0.0021, P=0.03) and in those free of baseline albuminuria and CKD (IDI=0.0036, P=0.008; Table 4). The continuous net reclassification index (NRI) was statistically significant in participants free of baseline albuminuria and low eGFR (NRI 0.030, P=0.02) but not in the general sample (P>0.05; Table 4).\n\nMendelian randomization:\n\nAs the top genetic variant (rs3184504) associated with plasma β2M levels is also associated with SH2B3 expression, we postulated that the trans-effects (>1 megabase upstream or downstream of the transcription start site) of the rs3184504 polymorphism on β2M levels may be mediated through its cis-effects (within 1 megabase) on SH2B3 expression. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two-sample inverse-variance weighted MR using all independent cis variants (LD r2<0.1) for SH2B3 expression as instrumental variables, SH2B3 expression as the exposure, and circulating β2M levels as the outcome. Decreased SH2B3 expression was found to be causal for higher β2M levels (β=−16.8, P=8.7E-11; Fig. 1).\n\nSh2b3−/− mouse model:\n\nTo recapitulate the effects of cis genetic variation within SH2B3, we tested the effects of SH2B3 deficiency on β2M expression at baseline and in response to angiotensin II-induced hypertension. The rs3184504 polymorphism is associated with reduced SH2B3 function in humans, and we previously reported that Sh2b3−/− mice had a greater hypertensive response and more severe renal/vascular dysfunction in response to angiotensin II infusion. Analysis of RNA sequencing performed on whole blood from wild type and Sh2b3−/− mice revealed a significant induction of β2M expression in response to angiotensin II administration only in Sh2b3−/− mice (P=0.037; Fig. 2) suggesting that SH2B3 normally constrains β2M expression in response to hypertensive stimuli and that enhanced β2M expression may be causally related to the exaggerated hypertensive response and end-organ damage seen in Sh2b3−/− animals."

An interaction effect was observed for risk of NTDs in infants with the SHMT1 SNP rs12939757 AG genotype that were in the low folate intake group compared to infants with the AA genotype that were in the high folate intake group (OR[int AA vs. AG] = 2.01; 80% CI: 1.20, 3.37 (LRT P = 0.10)).\n\nTYMS\n\nThe gene-folate interaction was associated with a reduced risk of NTDs for mothers in the low folate intake group with TYMS SNP rs502396 or rs699517 heterozygous genotype compared to the high folate intake group with the common homozygous genotype (OR[int TT vs. CT] = 0.91, 80% CI: 0.53, 1.56 (LRT P = 0.12); OR[int CC vs. CT] = 0.70, 80% CI: 0.38, 1.29 (LRT P = 0.19), Table II).

The joint effect of these two factors was the same as the sum of their individual effects (SI=1.08, 95% CI: 0.70–1.67). There was no evidence for multiplicative interaction (Pinteraction=0.94).\n\nIn the subsample of women with stable diets, the odds for AMD associated with having both poor lifestyle score and the high-risk CFH genotype was 4.6 times greater compared to women with healthy lifestyle and low-risk genotype (OR=4.63, 95% CI: 1.85–11.60; Table 3b). The joint effect of these two factors in this subsample was more than the sum of their individual effects, implying synergy (SI=1.34, 95% CI: 1.05–1.70). The greatest increase in odds for AMD associated with poor lifestyle scores was among women with high genetic risk. In women with the high-risk CFH genotype (CC), the odds of AMD were 3 times higher for those with the lowest HLS (0–2) relative to those with highest HLS (4–6) (OR=4.63 vs. 1.56, Ptrend across HLS groups within genotype class=0.04; Table 3b). We explored whether better status for LZ among women with high versus low HLS explained the association between HLS and AMD in women with the high risk CC genotype. Indeed, the ORs for AMD comparing high versus low HLS in those with highest genetic risk were attenuated by 30, 9, and 15% when adjusting for LZ in the diet, serum and MPOD (respectively), suggesting that better status for LZ could partially explain these associations between HLS and AMD. The joint effects of CFH genotype and dietary LZ intake similarly suggest at least additive effects of these two risk factors for AMD (Tables 4a and 4b; available at http://aaojournal.org).\n\nWe also explored whether higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids explained the association between HLS and AMD in women with the high risk CC genotype. OR and interaction terms were not influenced at all by this adjustment (data not shown.)\n\nInteractions between ARMS2 Genotype and Healthy Lifestyle Score\n\nThe joint effect of poor lifestyle and ARMS2 risk alleles was difficult to discern due to low sample sizes after cross-classification, only 18 individuals had both two A69S risk alleles and HLS between 0–2. Individuals with one or two A69S risk alleles were combined for subsequent analyses. In the full sample, the odds for AMD was 2 times greater in women who had at least one ARMS2 risk allele and low HLS, relative to zero risk alleles and high HLS (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.29–3.02; Table 3a). The synergy index suggests non-significant, sub-additive joint effects of ARMS2 genetic risk and poor lifestyle (SI=0.9, 95% CI: 0.27–2.93). There was no evidence for a multiplicative interaction (Pinteraction=0.63). In the subsample of women with stable diets, the odds for AMD for women with both risk factors, relative to neither, was 1.75 (95% CI: 0.92–3.30; Table 3b). The synergy index was statistically significant for more than additive effects in this reduced sample (SI=1.65, 95% CI: 1.18–2.30). However, the SI is dependent on the reference group having the lowest odds for disease, which is not the case in this subsample (lowest odds was among women of low genetic risk and HLS=3, OR=0.67). Considering the totality of evidence presented here, there is no evidence to suggest deviations from either additive or multiplicative effects of ARMS2 genotype and healthy lifestyles.\n\nInteractions between Other AMD Risk Genotypes and Healthy Lifestyle Score\n\nJoint effects of lifestyle score and variants in additional complement pathway genes (CFB/C2, C3 rs2230199 and CFI rs10033900) were also explored (Tables 5a and 5b; available at http://aaojournal.org). Absent main effects for SNPs in C3 and CFI (Table 2), along with a variable combination of genotype and HLS lending towards the lowest odds for AMD, resulted in unreliable estimates of synergy for these genotypes and HLS."

    "content": "3. Results\n\n3.1. Baseline Characteristics\n\nOf the 4054 participants in the association analysis, a total of 480 (11.8%) and 2468 (60.9%) participants developed type 2 diabetes and prediabetes during the 12-year follow-up period, respectively. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study population according to habitual coffee consumption. Compared with non-coffee consumers, participants who consumed either black coffee or sugared coffee were more likely to be younger, smoke, drink alcohol, and have a higher BMI.\n\n3.2. Genetic Polymorphisms Associated with Coffee Consumption\n\nIn the GWAS of habitual coffee consumption, a total of 18 SNPs located in 12q24 achieved a suggestive significance (p < 1 × 10−5) (Table S2). When we additionally adjusted for baseline BMI, the same 18 significant SNPs were identified as well (Table S3). SNPs identified based on habitual coffee consumption were the same when we additionally conducted a GWAS for continuous caffeine intake.\n\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 show the Manhattan plot and regional association plot, respectively. Figure 3 shows the Q-Q plot, and the genomic inflation factor (λ) of the GWAS was 1.0103, suggesting that the study population structure was well-adjusted. Among the SNPs achieved suggestive significance at p < 1 × 10−5, we selected SNPs as follows, which were used later for calculating the genetic risk scores. First, pairwise correlations were examined and high correlation was declared when r2 > 0.8 (Figure 4). Then, we excluded all imputed SNPs having a high correlation with any genotyped SNP, and selected the SNPs among highly-correlated genotyped SNPs. As a result, three genotyped SNPs (rs2074356, rs11066015, and rs12229654) and two imputed SNPs (rs11065828 and rs79105258) were considered as coffee-related SNPs and used for calculating the genetic risk scores. Table 2 presents the information on these five SNPs related to coffee consumption. The SNPs were located in genes HECTD4, ACAD10, MYL2, and CUX2, and the minor allele frequency ranged from 0.143 to 0.172 in our population.\n\n3.3. Coffee Consumption and the Risk of Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Combined\n\nWe examined the association between black coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined (Table 3). Compared with non-black-coffee consumers, participants who consumed ≥2 cups/day of black coffee had a 39% lower risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined among men and women combined (95% CI = 0.38–0.95; p for trend = 0.023). When we separated men and women, compared with non-black-coffee consumers, participants who consumed ≥2 cups/day of black coffee had a 54% lower risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined among men (95% CI = 0.23–0.94; p for trend = 0.026). Although the association was not statistically significant among women, an inverse trend was observed (OR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.41–1.34).\n\nTable 4 presents the association between sugared coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined. The ORs (95% CIs) of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined comparing sugared-coffee consumers with non-sugared-coffee consumers were 0.73 (0.60–0.89; p for trend = 0.005) for men and women combined, 0.71 (0.52–0.97; p for trend = 0.015) for men, and 0.75 (0.57–0.99; p for trend = 0.080) for women.\n\n3.4. Associations Modified by Genetic Risk Scores\n\nWe analyzed whether the association between habitual coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined varied by genetic polymorphisms. For black-coffee consumers, we found that an inverse association was more pronounced among individuals with high genetic risk scores, but the interaction was not statistically significant (p for interaction = 0.261) (Table 5). The ORs (95% CIs) for ≥2 cups/day of black coffee vs. non-black-coffee consumers were 0.87 (0.46–1.66) for participants with 0 points, 0.49 (0.17–1.44) for those with 0.1 to <5 points, and 0.36 (0.15–0.88) for those with 5 to 10 points for their genetic risk scores. For sugared coffee consumption, the associations with the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined were similar across genetic risk scores (p for interaction = 0.608) (Table 6). When we conducted an interaction analysis for each coffee-related SNP for black coffee consumption, the association between black coffee consumption and the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes combined was inverse for the minor allele of each SNP (Table 7)."

    "content": "Results\n\nSENP1-deficient mice exhibit T1DM phenotype\n\nTo investigate possible function of SENP1 in inflammation and diabetes, we created genetically modified mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of SENP1 with three different deleter lines carrying the Cre recombinase driven by the Adiponectin, PdgfRα or aP2/Fabp4 gene promoter (named as SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 1A). While the PdgfRα-Cre is predominantly expressed in bipotent progenitor adipocytes (white and beige adipocytes), the Adipoq-Cre has high efficiency and specificity in mature adipocytes. The aP2-Cre has a moderate efficiency in adipocytes with variable degrees of target gene recombination in macrophages or capillary endothelium in a floxed gene locus-dependent manner.\n\nSENP1 expression (messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein) was diminished in isolated adipocytes from interscapular brown adipose tissue, perigonadal white adipose tissue and peri-pancreatic adipose tissue (PAT) of SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO (with less efficiency in brown adipose tissue) and SENP1-aP2KO mice compared with the control SENP1lox/lox (Ctrl). In contrast, SENP1 expression was intact in isolated macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) and pancreatic islets from these mice (Supplementary Fig. 1B–C). Moreover, enhanced green fluorescent protein was detected in PATs but not in pancreatic islets when aP2-Cre deleter mice mating with mT/mG reporter mice (Supplementary Fig. 1D).\n\nSENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice were viable after birth. However, these adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice all developed a diabetic phenotype (Fig. 1a–c). An age-dependent increase in glucose levels was observed in SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice compared with the control SENP1lox/lox mice with an early onset of diabetes in SENP1-PdgfRKO at the age of 6 weeks (blood glucose level >225 mg dl−1); this earlier onset of hyperglycaemia is consistent with the high efficiency of PdgfRα-Cre in adipocyte progenitors. We observed similar phenotypic changes in both male (Fig. 1a–c) and female with or without fasting, and we focused on male mice for further studies. We measured glucose levels in SENP1-smKO and SENP1-ecKO mice, in which the SENP1 gene was specifically deleted in smooth muscle cells/pericytes by SM22α-Cre (SENP1-smKO) and in vascular endothelial cells by VE-cadherin-Cre (SENP1-ecKO), respectively. Unlike SENP1-aP2KO mice, SENP1-smKO and SENP1-ecKO mice did not develop a high-glucose phenotype even at the age of 14 weeks (Fig. 1d).\n\nInsulin levels in plasma were measured at various ages, and insulin secretion in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice was significantly declined after the ages of 8 and 10 weeks, respectively (Fig. 1e,f). Glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed at the age of 14 weeks to evaluate diabetes and insulin resistance. The level of hyperglycaemia observed with the GTT was prolonged in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice compared with Ctrl mice (Fig. 1g–j). However, similar insulin responses were observed between SENP1-deficient mice and Ctrl in the ITT assays (Fig. 1k,l for aP2KO mice). We then performed glucose-stimulated insulin assay with isolated islets. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from SENP1-deficient islets was significantly reduced (Fig. 1m). These data suggest that the high glucose level in SENP1-deficient mice was due to reduced insulin secretion.\n\nThe body weight and body mass are associated with the development of diabetes and increases in glucose levels. All SENP1-deficient mice had lower body weights compared with the control mice after onset of diabetes (Fig. 2a–d). However, adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice exhibited normal lipid profiles up to the age of 14 weeks, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA). Cholesterol and TG, but not HDL or FFA, were slightly reduced in SENP1-aP2KO mice after the age of 18 weeks (Fig. 2e–g). Water consumption and food-intake monitoring showed that SENP1-aP2KO mice had increased water consumption with similar dairy food uptake compared with Ctrl mice (Fig. 2h–i). Taken together, the assays described above suggest that type-1-like diabetic phenotypes developed in the adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice.\n\nSENP1 deficient mice show autoimmune mediated damages\n\nInsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus results from T-cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet β cells. To determine the pathogenesis of diabetes in SENP1-deficient mice, we examined pancreatic development and pathology by haematoxylin and eosin stain and immunostaining for pancreatic β-cell number, mass and morphology changes, as well as immune cell invasion, indicative of insulitis. At early ages before the onset of hyperglycaemia, no significant differences were detected in pancreatic mass, β-cell number between the Ctrl and SENP1-deficient mice. However, the structures of pancreatic islets in SENP1-AdipoqKO, SENP1-PdgfRKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice were drastically disrupted with increased TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL)-positive apoptosis of β cells after onset of diabetes and more severe at late stages (Fig. 3a–c for SENP1-aP2KO; Supplementary Fig. 2 for SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-PdgfRKO). There was a sharp decline in insulin staining and CD31+ vascular area in the islets in SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 3d with quantifications in Fig. 3e), indicating a loss of function in the β cell with disrupted vasculatures. These data provide direct evidence in support of apoptosis as the mechanism of β-cell death in SENP1-deficient mice.\n\nImmune cell-specific effector T-cell invasion in the pancreatic tissue attacks the islets and induces cell death. We observed an accumulation of white blood cells invasion into the islets in SENP1-deficient mice. In T1DM, β cell and islets are attacked by activated cytotoxic T cells. The section staining in the pancreases demonstrated that CD8+ T cells were absent from the islets of Ctrl mice. No pancreatic infiltrations of immune cells were detected in the SENP1-aP2KO mice under the age of 7 weeks. However, CD8+ T cells infiltrated into the islets of SENP1-aP2KO mice by the age of 12 weeks (Fig. 3f,g). Similar results were observed for CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A–B). These data strongly suggest a T-cell dominant mechanism for β-cell destruction.\n\nThe pre-diabetic phase of the disease usually begins several years before the clinical onset of the disease. During this phase, autoantibodies, mainly insulin autoantibody (IAA), are directed against β cells. IAA levels, along with other clinical information, aid in the diagnosis of T1DM. CRP and β-hydroxybutyrate are important clinical parameters for the diagnosis of diabetes. Individuals who develop diabetes typically have higher CRP levels. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is classified as ketones that are produced in the body when the body loses its ability to absorb glucose properly. SENP1-aP2KO mice had increased levels of IAA in the blood as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with an IAA-specific antibody. Greater levels of CRP and β-hydroxybutyrate were also observed in the blood of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 3h–j). All of the above data support the appearance of typical T1DM in SENP1-aP2KO mice.\n\nWe then fully characterized the immune system in the SENP1-deficient mice. We transplanted skin from mice (BALB/C) to Ctrl SENP1lox/lox and SENP1-aP2KO mice (C57BL/6 background). Severe skin-rejection response appeared in both Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice at an equal level, indicating SENP1-aP2KO mice are not immunodeficient (Supplementary Fig. 3C). We examined the immune cell populations in pancreas, pancreatic lymph nodes and spleen of SENP1-deficient mice. The distribution of immune cells in the pancreases was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses with specific surface markers. MHCII+CD11b+CD11c− macrophages, CD3e+ T cells and CD19+ B cells were markedly increased in the pancreases of SENP1-aP2KO versus the Ctrl mice (Supplementary Fig. 3D for FACS and Fig. 3k for quantifications). Subset T cells play a key role in regulation of inflammation and immune tolerance. We observed that Th1 (IFN-γ+CD4+) and Th17 (IL-17+CD4+) effector T-cell subsets expanded concomitant with reduction of regulatory T-cell subset (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) in the pancreatic lymph nodes of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 3E–G for FACS and Fig. 3l for quantifications). We also observed an increase in activated dendritic cells in the lymph node of pancreases (Fig. 3m). Moreover, an autoantigen NRP-V7-positive CD8+ T cells, targeting a peptide from islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein, were detected in the pancreatic lymph nodes and the spleen of SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 12 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 3H for FACS and Fig. 3n,o for quantifications). All of the events suggest autoimmune responses occur in the pancreases of SENP1-deficient mice, consistent with that T1DM is an autoimmune disease in which insulin deficiency is a consequence of immunological destruction of the pancreatic β cells.\n\nPATs secret cytokines\n\nThe proinflammatory cytokines overproduction in early phase of disease could serve as a main reason for immunologic tolerance break and immune cell expansion in diabetes. We found that the circulating proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and IL-Iβ, but not IFN-γ, were significantly elevated in the SENP1-deficient mice before the onset of diabetes at the age of 7 weeks (Fig. 4a). However, the levels of circulating cytokines might be too low to induce systemic autoimmune responses. Consistently, SENP1-deficient mice had normal cardiac function and vascular reactivity. These mice exhibit increased systemic cytokines and cardiac myocarditis at the age of 14 weeks or older, indicating a prevalence of diabetic phenotype in the SENP1-deficient mice.\n\nAdipose tissue has been recognized as the largest endocrine organ and produces a large amount of cytokines. We reasoned that PATs might express high levels of cytokines to induce local (pancreas) inflammatory responses and diabetic phenotype in SENP1-deficient mice. Indeed, PATs from SENP1-aP2KO mice expressed high levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β at the age of 7 weeks (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 4A). We also compared cytokine transcripts expressed in the adipocytes from PATs, subcutaneous (inguinal) and gonadal and peri-renal adipose tissues at the age of 7 weeks. Ctrl mice expressed little basal cytokines in all adipose tissues. We did not observe significant differences for SENP1 deletion in different adipose depots. However, SENP1 deletion strongly enhanced gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the PATs compared with other adipose depots (Fig. 4c). To exclude the impact of macrophages or T cells affects the cytokine concentration, we examined immune cell numbers and cell-type-specific cytokine expression in the pancreas and PATs. We did not detect significant differences in cell numbers of macrophages and T cells in PATs (Fig. 4d) or pancreas of Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 7 weeks. Moreover, expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β by isolated pancreatic T cells and macrophages were >10-fold lower than isolated PAT adipocytes as measured by ELISA (Fig. 4e). Similar results were obtained from measuring intracellular cytokine levels in adipocytes, T cells and macrophages within PATs by FACS on intracellular staining of single cells (Supplementary Fig. 4B), suggesting that peri-pancreatic adipocytes primarily contribute to cytokine production in SENP1-aP2KO mice before the onset of diabetes. Of note, we detected macrophages infiltration into the pancreases of SENP1-aP2KO mice at later phases (14 weeks), and these macrophages expressed high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 4C–D).\n\nWe reasoned that the local high concentrations of cytokines might induce chemokine expression in adjacent pancreatic islets to recruit immune cells. It is known that CCL5 (RANTES, the CCR5 ligand) can direct recruitment of immune cells to inflammation sites or to autoimmune targets that may contribute to type-1 diabetic development. We analysed gene expression of chemokines that had been reported to be expressed in the pancreas. We found that CCL5 was strongly upregulated in the pancreatic islets of SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 7 weeks before disease the onset. CCL2, CCL21, CXCL19 and CXCL10 were weakly upregulated in pancreatic islets of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 4f). Expression of CCL5 in islet β cells was confirmed by co-staining of CCL5 with insulin (Fig. 4g). However, upregulation of CCL5 was not detected in other tissues of SENP1-aP2KO mice at the age of 7 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 4E), suggesting a specific effect of PAT-derived cytokines on adjacent islets. This is consistent with human protein expression database that CCL5 is only detected in pancreas but not in other tissues except blood and immune cells (GeneCards; http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CCL5). We then directly tested whether proinflammatory cytokines secreted from PATs could induce CCL5 expression in isolated islets. CCL5 mRNA in islets was significantly upregulated by conditional media of SENP1-aP2KO pancreatic adipocytes, and this upregulation was reduced by a neutralizing antibody to IL-6, TNF or IL-1β, and blunted by a combination of the three antibodies (Fig. 4h). These data suggest that high levels of local proinflammatory cytokines secreted from PATs induces CCL5 expression in islets, which in turn recruits immune cells into pancreas, causing damages of β cells.\n\nWe also tested a direct effect of adipocyte-derived cytokines on the pancreatic islets. To this end, isolated normal mouse pancreatic islets were incubated with culture supernatant of adipocytes from Ctrl or SENP1-aP2KO, and islet structure and apoptosis were monitored by Live/Dead viability/Cytotoxicity assays. We found that culture supernatant from adipocytes of SENP1-aP2KO strongly induced β-cell death and pancreatic disruption (Fig. 4i,j), suggesting that cytokines from peri-pancreatic adipocytes of SENP1-aP2KO mice have direct cytotoxic effects on pancreatic islet.\n\nTaken together, these results indicate that high local concentrations of cytokines derived from PATs not only upregulate CCL5 expression and CCL5-mediated infiltration of immune cells in pancreas but also directly induce cytotoxic damages on pancreatic islets.\n\nSENP1 deletion augments NF-κB dependent inflammation\n\nIt has been proposed that adipose tissue depots originate from distinct precursor cells are functionally diverse, and modulate disease processes in a depot-specific manner. We observed that peri-pancreatic adipocytes from SENP1-aP2KO exhibit 1.8-fold smaller cell sizes (Fig. 5a,b) with two- to three folds more cell numbers than the Ctrl adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5A–B). Moreover, peri-pancreatic adipocytes from SENP1-aP2KO mice expressed reduced differentiation markers including fatty acid synthase, adipose triglyceride lipase and lipoprotein lipase (Fig. 5c). In contrast, gonadal and subcutaneous inguinal adipocytes in SENP1-aP2KO mice exhibited a much weaker phenotype; they showed a smaller size at old ages (14 weeks) without significant increases in cell numbers; these phenotypes likely contribute to the reduced fat pad weight (Supplementary Fig. 5C–H) and total body weight of SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-PdgfRKO mice. These data are consistent with the notion that a reduced state of adipocyte differentiation correlates with enhanced proinflammatory phenotype in some adipose depots.\n\nPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) is not only the master regulator of adipogenesis but also plays a critical role in repressing inflammatory responses in a SUMOylation-dependent manner. Therefore, we first examined whether PPARγ was a SENP1 target in adipocytes. We found that expression of total PPARγ mRNA and protein levels were similar in Ctrl and SENP1-deficient adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5I,J). Although PPARγ was SUMOylated in both Ctrl and SENP1-null adipocytes, no significant difference was detected between Ctrl and SENP1-deficient cells (Supplementary Fig. 5K,L). These results suggest that SUMOylation of PPARγ may not contribute to the reduced adipogenesis and enhanced cytokine production in PATs of SENP1-deficient mice.\n\nNF-κB is a critical activator of genes for inflammation and immune regulation. We observed that phosphorylations of IKK, IκBα and NF-κB subunit p65/RelA were increased with concomitant reduction of total IκBα in the adipose tissues of SENP1-aP2KO mice. In contrast, phosphorylation and total levels of ERK1/2 in adipose tissues were not affected by SENP1 deletion (Fig. 5d). NF-κB was further determined by intracellular staining for phosphor-p65/RelA in PAT sections. We observed phosphor-p65/RelA positive staining in the PAT, but not in the pancreas (Fig. 5e). The phosphor-p65/RelA was much stronger in SENP1-aP2KO adipocytes, marked by adipocyte-specific marker FABP4 (Fig. 5f,g). However, phosphor-p65/RelA was not localized with a macrophage marker F4/80 (Fig. 5h). We further performed p65/RelA chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in Ctrl and SENP1-deficient cells isolated from Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice. We observed increased p65/RelA bindings to the IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α promoters in SENP1-aP2KO adipocytes (Fig. 5i,j). To directly test whether SENP1 deficiency regulates the NF-κB activation and cytokine production in adipocytes in vitro, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were first differentiated into the mature adipocytes and then transfected with a Ctrl or SENP1 short interfering RNA (siRNA). In the adipocytes with the SENP1 knockdown, phosphorylated IKK, IκBα and NF-κB p65/RelA levels were increased markedly (Fig. 5k). The gene expressions of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1 β, but not IFN-γ) from adipocytes were significantly higher in SENP1 knockdown cells (Fig. 5l), which concurs with our observations in SENP1-AdipoqKO and SENP1-aP2KO mice, as well as in adipocytes isolated from these mice. Conversely, overexpression of SENP1 into SENP1-deficient adipocytes markedly decreased phospho-p65/RelA and cytokine productions. Taken together, our results suggest that SENP1 directly regulates the activation of NF-κB and cytokine production in adipocytes.\n\nSENP1 deletion augments NEMO SUMOylation in adipocytes\n\nOf the NF-κB components, SUMOylation of IKK subunit NEMO and NF-κB p65/RelA are thought to be critical events for the activation of IKK-NF-κB signalling. SENP2 can efficiently deSUMOylate NEMO to blunt NF-κB activation in a 293T overexpression system and SENP1 was proposed to have a similar role. To determine the role of SENP1 in pancreatic proinflammatory phenotype and NF-κB regulation, we first examined expression of SENPs in PATs. The SENPs can be divided into three families. The first family members SENP1 and SENP2 have broad specificity for the three mammalian SUMOs (SUMO1–3), while the second family (SENP3 and SENP5) and the third family (SENP6 and SENP7) prefer SUMO2/3 as substrates. We found that SENP1, but not SENP2, was abundantly expressed in mouse adipose tissues. Deletion of SENP1 had no effects on expression of other SENPs (Supplementary Fig. 6). SUMOylations of NEMO and p65/RelA were determined by co-immunoprecipitation from the denaturing adipocyte extracts with specific antibodies followed by western blotting with anti-SUMO1. No difference in p65/RelA was detected between Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 6a). However, an extra band appeared ∼70 kDa in the SENP1-aP2KO adipocyte extracts for NEMO (Fig. 6b). Increased NEMO SUMOylation in SENP1-KO adipocyte was further confirmed by overexpression of Flag-NEMO (Fig. 6c). It is reported that NEMO SUMOylation and IKK activation are enhanced by stress responses such as oxidative stress, inflammatory stimuli and DNA damage in different cell types. We observed that DNA damage agent etoposide VP16 induced phosphorylation of IKK and p65/RelA in adipocytes, and SENP1 deletion enhanced both basal and stress-induced IKK and p65/RelA activation (Fig. 6d). SENP1 deletion also enhanced both basal and stress-induced NEMO SUMOylation in adipocytes as detected by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-NEMO followed by immunoblotting with anti-SUMO1 (Fig. 6e).\n\nIt has been reported that NEMO can be SUMOylated at K277 and K309 (ref.). To determine the functional importance of SUMO modifications in regulating NF-κB signalling in adipocytes, a single (K277R or K309R) and double lysine to arginine mutants (DM) were constructed as Flag-NEMO. Wild type (WT) or mutant Flag-NEMO was then was expressed in peri-pancreatic adipocytes isolated from SENP1-aP2KO mice, and the exogenous NEMO versus endogenous NEMO was about 1:1 ratio (Fig. 6f). While phosphorylation of NF-κB p65/RelA was slightly increased by NEMO-WT, it was mildly decreased by NEMO K277R and strongly decreased by NEMO K309R or the double mutant as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 6f) and intracellular staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated p-p65/RelA (Fig. 6g,h). These data suggest that SUMO-deficient NEMO mutants (NEMO K309R and NEMO-DM) function as dominant negative forms. NF-κB-dependent cytokine expression was then determined by ELISA in the NEMO-transfected cells. NEMO mutants had similar effects on the protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines in adipocytes (Fig. 6i), supporting that SUMOylated NEMO enhances cytokine expression.\n\nClinical relevance of adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice\n\nTo determine whether our studies from the adipocyte-specific SENP1-deficient mice have clinical relevance, we first investigated whether there is a correlation between SENP1 expression in adipocytes of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and human T1DM patients. The NOD mouse, a popularly used model for T1DM, developed diabetes with a late onset at the age of 14 weeks. Consistent with reports, we observed the incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the NOD mouse was 60–80% in females and 20–30% in males (Fig. 7a). Mouse strains with an adipocyte-specific deletion of SENP1 appeared more severe in hyperglycaemia and islet disruption compared with NOD mice at the same age (Fig. 7b versus Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 2). Importantly, we observed an age-dependent reduction of SENP1 expression in PATs of NOD mice (Fig. 7c), correlating with the T1DM progression in NOD mice.\n\nWe next investigated a correlation between SENP1 expression and proinflammatory cytokines in NOD model and human T1DM patients. To this end, venous blood was drawn from consenting volunteers (healthy and diabetic subjects; Supplementary Table 1). Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in T1DM patients compared with the normal cohorts (Fig. 7d). The levels of cytokines from SENP1-aP2KO at the age of 12 weeks are at similar ranges as human serum with T1DM. NOD develops diabetes as a result of Th1 dominant IFN-γ-induced insulitis and leukocyte infiltrations of the pancreatic islets. Consistently, NOD mice exhibit increased plasma IFN-γ with lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines compared with SENP1-aP2KO mice and serum from human T1DM patients (Fig. 7e versus Fig. 7d). We then tested whether serum could directly induce β-cell death and pancreatic disruption. To this end, isolated normal mouse pancreatic islets were cultured with serum collected from Ctrl, SENP1-aP2KO and NOD mice, or collected from normal human and T1DM patients. Islet structure and apoptosis was monitored by Live/Dead viability/Cytotoxicity assays. Serum from SENP1-aP2KO mice, NOD mice and human T1DM all induced disruption and pancreatic cell death (Fig. 7f,g). Taken together, our results support that SENP1-aP2KO mice is a clinically relevant model for human diabetes.\n\nWe also tested whether insulin could prevent or delay T1DM progression in SENP1-aP2KO mice. Since T1DM is an islet-reactive T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease and insulin and its precursor (pre)proinsulin are major targets of islet-reactive T cells, both in humans and in NOD mice. It has been hypothesized that that repeated subcutaneous insulin administration prevents disease by acting as a vaccination protocol potentially restoring immune tolerance. Recent data suggest that short-term subcutaneous insulin administration delays but does not prevent diabetes in NOD mice, likely by inducing a state of ‘β-cell rest' that would make β cells less vulnerable to metabolic stress, apoptosis and possibly to immune-mediated destruction. Our results indicated that prophylactic insulin therapy in SENP1-deficient mice at the age of 5 weeks for 9 weeks only partially ameliorates development of diabetes phenotypes including immune cell infiltration, β-cell apoptosis and islet disruptions (Supplementary Fig. 7A–F).\n\nNF-κB inhibitors ameliorate diabetes progression\n\nTo establish a causative link between SENP1-dependent NF-κB activation and type 1 diabetes, SENP1-aP2KO mice were treated at the age of 5 weeks with intraperitoneal injection of NF-κB activation inhibitor II JSH-23 (2 mg kg−1 in 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) diluted with PBS) twice a week for 6 weeks. JSH-23 had no effects on body weight, blood glucose and lipid profile in the Ctrl mice. However, administration of JSH-23 in SENP1-aP2KO mice diminished SENP1 deletion-induced elevation of blood glucose (Fig. 8a) and reduction of insulin levels in blood (Fig. 8b) concomitant with attenuated islet damages (Fig. 8c). These normalized phenotypes in JSH-23-treated SENP1-aP2KO mice correlated with basal levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the PATs of these mice (Fig. 8d). No CCL5 expression in islets (Fig. 8e,f) and apoptotic β-cells (Fig. 8g) were detected in the JSH-23-treated group. These results support a critical role of SENP1-dependent NF-κB activity in T1DM progression in SENP1-aP2KO mice.\n\nHFD augments diabetic phenotype in SENP1 deficient mice\n\nTo determine the role of the SENP1-NEMO-NF-κB-pathway in adipocyte inflammation and its link to both T1DM and T2DM, we have examined the phenotype of SENP1-aP2KO mice under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. HFD increased fat weight in all adipose depots including epididymal fat and PATs in Ctrl and SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 9a,b). PATs from SENP1-aP2KO exhibit 1.8-fold smaller cell sizes with 2–3-fold more cell numbers than the Ctrl adipocytes under normal chow and this phenotype was more marked under HFD (Fig. 9c), suggesting that HFD may stimulate adipogenesis in PATs of SENP1-aP2KO. PATs from SENP1-aP2KO mice expressed high levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β at the age of 7 weeks before the onset of diabetes, and these proinflammatory cytokines were higher in the PATs compared with other adipose depots (Fig. 4). HFD significantly augmented the cytokine production in PATs (Fig. 9d) and subsequent disruption of islet structures in SENP1-aP2KO (Fig. 9e). Consistently, HFD increased body weight (Fig. 9f) and accelerated hyperglycaemia with an onset at the age of 8 weeks (versus 12 weeks under chow) in SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 9g). Basal and glucose-stimulated insulin levels were significantly reduced in SENP1-aP2KO mice. Moreover, HFD caused further reduction of insulin levels in SENP1-aP2KO mice, but not in Ctrl mice (Fig. 9h–j). Although similar insulin responses were observed between SENP1-deficient mice and Ctrl under standard chow in the ITT assay, HFD significantly induced insulin resistance in Ctrl mice and more severe phenotype was observed in SENP1-aP2KO mice (Fig. 9k,l). Moreover, liver insulin resistance, a hallmark of obesity-linked T2DM development, was detected under basal but more pronounced under HFD conditions in SENP1 knockout (KO) mice (Fig. 9m,n). Taken together, our data demonstrate that HFD augments both T1DM and T2DM phenotypes in SENP1-aP2KO mice."

    "content": "Results\n\nCharacteristics of Selected Studies\n\n136 published reports before March, 2013 were identified in the database search. Of them, six studies met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis (Figure 1). Subgroup studies from three reports that contained more than one study subgroup were recognized as individual studies. Since the report by Lurie et al. had an overlapping population with another study, the subgroup with the smaller sample size was excluded from the analysis. A total of 4,107 cases and 6,661 controls from 11 subgroup studies that reported the association between the 5 common variants (ApaI, BsmI, Cdx-2, FokI and TaqI) and ovarian cancer risk were included in the meta-analysis. The characteristics of the identified studies are shown in Table 1.\n\nFokI (rs2228570 or rs10735810) and Ovarian Cancer Risk\n\nAs established from the literature search, all 11 subgroup studies, with 4,107 cases and 6,661 controls, evaluated the association between FokI and risk of ovarian cancer. None of the subgroup studies departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the allele T distribution in the controls. The meta-analysis indicated that FokI was significantly associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. As determined under the fixed-effect model, the pooled OR for CT carriers was 1.10 (95% CI = 1.00–1.20) and 1.16 (95% CI = 1.03–1.31) for the TT carriers relative to CC carriers (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The dominant genetic model also suggested that carriers of the T allele were associated with an 11% increased risk for ovarian cancer (pooled OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.02–1.21). The recessive genetic model indicated that carriers of homozygote TT showed a marginal 10% increased risk of ovarian cancer compared to those of TC or CC carriers (pooled OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.99–1.22). Similar results were found under the random-effects model as no significant heterogeneity between the studies was found for any meta-analysis of the variant (Table 2). Sensitivity analysis suggested that no single subgroup study significantly affected the overall estimates of the association between FokI and ovarian cancer. The funnel plot and the Egger’s test showed no significant publication bias for the identified subgroups. When we restricted the studies that were conducted in the Caucasians (3,959 cases and 6,410 controls), we found a significant association for the allele T carriers (pooled OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.02–1.22) when compared to the homozygotes CC carriers with no significant heterogeneity between the studies were identified.\n\nApaI (rs7975232) and Ovarian Cancer Risk\n\nSix subgroup studies from 3 reports, which included a total of 817 cases and 1,313 controls, evaluated the association for the variant ApaI (rs7975232) and risk for ovarian cancer (Table 1). None of the subgroup studies departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the allele G distribution in the controls. As determined with the fixed-effect model, there was no significant association for the variant and risk of ovarian cancer; relative to TT carriers, the pooled OR was 1.00 (95% CI = 0.81–1.24) for TG carriers and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.67–1.14) for GG carriers. Under the dominant genetic model, there was also no significant association for carriers of the G allele and the risk of ovarian cancer (pooled OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.79–1.18), as determined with the fixed-effect model. When we restricted to the Caucasians, no significant association for the variant and ovarian cancer risk was found (pooled OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.73–1.14; 630 cases and 991 controls). No significant heterogeneity between the studies was detected, and the Egger’s test indicated no significant publication bias for the subgroup studies (Table 2).\n\nBsmI (rs1544410) and Ovarian Cancer Risk\n\nNine subgroup studies from 5 publications, including a total of 2,332 cases and 3,301 controls, concerned the association of BsmI (rs1544410) and risk of ovarian cancer. Of these, the genotype distribution in the controls from four subgroup studies, including the Japanese subgroup by Lurie et al., Northern Sweden subgroup by Clendenen et al., the New England Case-Control (NECC) subgroup by Tworoger et al., and the African American subgroup by Grant et al., was departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<0.05) as indicated by Chi-square tests. The fixed-effect model suggested no significant association between the variant and ovarian cancer risk (GA vs. GG: pooled OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.99–1.25; AA vs. GG: pooled OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.86–1.20), as under the dominant genetic model (pooled OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.97–1.22; AA/GA vs. GG). After excluding the subgroup conducted in the African American population performed by Grant et al., which contributed most to the heterogeneity between the studies, the pooled estimate suggested that carriers of the A allele showed a significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer (pooled OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.01–1.28) relative to GG carriers. No significant publication bias was found for the meta-analysis (Table 2). When we restricted the studies to Caucasians, we also found no significant association for the variant with ovarian cancer risk (pooled OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.98–1.24; 2,183 cases and 3,052 controls) with no significant heterogeneity between the studies were identified (Q = 4.94, df = 6, P = 0.551; I2 = 0%).\n\nCdx-2 (rs11568820) and Ovarian Cancer Risk\n\nTwo reports with 4 subgroup studies and with a total of 1,567 cases and 2,226 controls evaluated the association of Cdx-2 and ovarian cancer risk. Of these, subgroup studies conducted with a Japanese subgroup by Lurie et al. and with the NECC subgroup by Tworoger et al., were departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<0.05). With the random-effects model, the meta-analysis suggested no significant association for the variant and the risk of ovarian cancer; the pooled OR was 1.02 (95% CI = 0.75–1.38) for GA and 1.00 (95% CI = 0.74–1.35) for AA carriers relative to the common GG carriers. The dominant genetic model also indicated that the variant was not associated with risk of ovarian cancer, and no significant heterogeneity between the studies was found (Table 2). The Egger’s test found no publication bias for the meta-analysis (Table 2). When we restricted the studies to Caucasians, we found that the variant was associated with the ovarian cancer risk (pooled OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.04–1.37; 1,475 cases and 2,055 controls) with no significant heterogeneity between the studies were identified (Q = 0.16, df = 2, P = 0.922; I2 = 0%).\n\nTaqI (rs731236) and Ovarian Cancer Risk\n\nFrom the literature search, 6 subgroup studies from 3 reports that considered 784 cases and 1,248 controls evaluated the association between TaqI and risk of ovarian cancer. The Northern Sweden subgroup, performed by Clendenen et al., departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<0.05). Our meta-analysis indicated that the variant had no significant effect on the risk of ovarian cancer. The pooled OR was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.90–1.35) for TC carriers and 1.09 (95% CI = 0.82–1.45) for CC carriers relative to TT carriers. The fixed-effect model and the random-effects model found a null association for the variant and risk of ovarian cancer under the dominant genetic model (pooled OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.91–1.33). There was no significant heterogeneity between studies included in the meta-analysis. However, there was a marginal publication bias under the dominant genetic model (P = 0.04, Table 2). Sensitivity tests showed that no single study greatly influenced the estimates of overall risk. When restricted the studies performed in the Caucasians, we also noticed no significant association between the variant and the ovarian cancer (pooled OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.91–1.39; 636 cases and 996 controls)."

    "content": "Results\n\nThe genotype frequencies of the four analyzed VDR variants did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the different subsets (P > 0.01), and their genotyping success rate was over 95%. The statistical power of this study is detailed in Table 1. The SNPs rs731236, rs7975232 and rs1544410 showed a relatively high LD in our study population (Fig. 1). Particularly, rs731236 and rs1544410 had an r2 value = 0.93. On the contrary, rs2228570 had an r2 value <0.10 with the other SNPs.\n\nFirst, to analyze the possible implication of the VDR polymorphisms in the susceptibility to infection by T. cruzi, the allelic and genotypic frequencies of seronegative and seropositive individuals were compared (Table 2). No statistical significance was observed for rs731236, rs7975232 and rs1544410, indicating that these variants may not influence the risk of infection by T. cruzi in the studied population. On the other hand, the allele frequencies of rs2228570 differed significantly between the seronegative and seropositive groups (P = 0.0287, OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.67−0.98). The minor allele rs2228570*A was overrepresented in the seronegative subset (45.41% vs. 39.94%), suggesting a possible protective effect of this variant against infection by T. cruzi. However, the statistical significance was lost after correction for multiple testing (P = 0.1147).\n\nNext, we evaluated the possible association between the VDR SNPs and the susceptibility to develop CCC. For that, we compared the allelic and genotypic frequencies of asymptomatic and CCC patients (Table 3). Similar to that observed in the previous analysis, no differences in the allele frequencies of both subgroups of patients were observed for the analyzed SNPs except for rs2228570 (P = 4.46E−03, OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.14−2.00). This association was maintained after controlling for multiple testing (P = 0.0178). In this case, the frequency of the rs2228570*A allele was reduced in the asymptomatic patients (34.41% vs. 42.47%), suggesting a putative protective role of this variant against CCC development.\n\nOn the other hand, a possible haplotypic effect of the studied VDR SNPs was also tested. Due to the high LD in this population (Fig. 1), only three haplotypes were observed in the studied individuals (rs731236|rs7975232|rs1544410: ACC, GAT and AAC). No evidence of association was observed for any haplotype in the different tests performed (seronegative vs. seropositive and asymptomatic vs. CCC, data not shown)."

After a further screening of full text, an additional 90 studies were excluded due to lack of relevance (n = 90), incomplete data (n = 5), and HWE deviation (n = 6) ( Figure 1). 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis: three studies for IL-1A (rs1800587), , ,  two studies for TNF-A (rs361525), ,  and nine studies for VDR (rs731236). , , -  The summary of studies included in the meta-analysis is presented in Table 1.\n\nDistribution of allele and genotype frequency of IL-1A -889C>T, TNF-A 238G>A and VDR TaqI \n\nOur data indicated that the TT genotype of IL-1A -889C>T was 1.37 more frequent in HNP patients than in controls, while the distribution of alleles and other genotypes were similar between patients and healthy controls.

    "content": "Results\n\nThe 10 variants included in the MR analysis of maternal serum B12 levels explained 5.24% of the variance in serum B12 concentrations in the original GWAS (3.82% without the FUT2 variant, rs602662). The four variants included in the MR analysis of maternal folate levels explained 1.3% of the total variation in serum folate concentration in the original GWAS. F statistics for individual SNPs ranged from 35 to 623 for B12 and from 48 to 203 for folate levels. The magnitude of the SNP effects on serum B12 and folate concentrations measured in pregnant women from the EFSOCH study were consistent with those from the original GWAS (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online), apart from the MMACHC variant, rs12272669, which appeared to have little effect in pregnant women at 28 weeks of gestation (heterogeneity P = 0.0002). However, we used a proxy for this variant in the EFSOCH study, rs11234541, which was in high LD with rs12272669 but had low imputation quality.\n\nThe causal effect estimates of maternal and fetal B12 and folate levels on birthweight from the IVW analysis and sensitivity analyses are shown in Table 1. We found no evidence for a causal effect of maternal B12 levels on offspring birthweight [0.009 SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher B12 (SEIVW = 0.012), PIVW = 0.469; Figure 1], or of fetal B12 levels on their own birthweight [−0.012 SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher B12 (SEIVW = 0.017), PIVW = 0.478; Supplementary Figure S3, available as Supplementary data at IJE online]. The effect estimates were similar when excluding the FUT2 variant, rs602662 (Supplementary Table S4, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).\n\nWe found evidence of a positive causal effect of maternal folate levels on offspring birthweight [0.146 SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher folate (SEIVW = 0.041), PIVW = 4x10-4; Figure 2]. Furthermore, we identified a negative effect of fetal folate levels on their own birthweight, although the effect size was nearly a third of the maternal folate causal effect estimate [−0.051 SD change in birthweight per 1 SD higher folate (SEIVW = 0.025), PIVW = 0.037; Supplementary Figure S4].\n\nThere was evidence of heterogeneity in the causal effect estimates of fetal B12 levels on their own birthweight across the individual SNPs (Q = 27.790, P = 0.001), but no strong evidence of heterogeneity in the causal effect estimates of maternal B12 levels on offspring birthweight (Q = 12.486, P = 0.162). To investigate the heterogeneity further, we performed leave-one-out analysis of fetal B12 levels on their own birthweight (Supplementary Table S5, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). As indicated by the heterogeneity test, there was some variability in the causal estimates, particularly when leaving the MMACHC SNP, rs12272669, or the FUT2 SNP, rs602662, out of the analysis. Even though there are no known pleiotropic pathways for the MMACHC gene, we a priori expected the FUT2 gene to have pleiotropic effects. The causal effect estimates of maternal folate levels on offspring birthweight across the individual SNPs also showed some heterogeneity (Q = 6.904, P = 0.075), but no evidence for the fetal folate levels (Q = 0.018, P = 0.999). To investigate the potential influence of the SNPs in LD in the MTHFR gene and potential heterogeneity identified for the maternal folate levels, we performed a leave-one-out analysis on both maternal and fetal folate levels on birthweight (Supplementary Table S6, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). When the MTHFR SNP rs1801133 was excluded from the analysis, the causal effect was attenuated for the effect of maternal folate levels (0.099, SE = 0.051, P = 0.051), but stayed the same and for fetal folate levels (−0.051, SE = 0.034, P = 0.132).\n\nThere was no evidence of directional pleiotropy from the MR Egger regression analysis for either B12 or folate levels on birthweight (Egger intercept for maternal B12 levels = 0.003, P = 0.500; Egger intercept for fetal B12 levels = −0.002, P = 0.662; Egger intercept for maternal folate levels = −0.028, P = 0.187; Egger intercept for fetal folate levels = 0.000, P = 0.988), although again highlighting that the MR Egger result from the folate analysis would be unreliable due to the small number of SNPs. This is further supported by the low I2GX of 0.83 for the folate analysis, which is below the suggested cut-off of 0.9, suggesting that the MR Egger results could be influenced by measurement error or weak instrument bias. Bowden's I2GX was 0.98 for B12, suggesting little influence in the MR Egger analyses from measurement error or weak instrument bias.\n\nWe were unable to detect evidence for a causal effect of B12 levels on folate levels in the two Danish cohorts (Supplementary Table S7, available as Supplementary data at IJE online), indicating that maternal folate levels are unlikely to mediate a relationship between maternal B12 levels and offspring birthweight. In the IVW analysis, we detected a small causal effect of folate levels on B12 levels in the two Danish cohorts (0.155 SD change in B12 per 1 SD higher folate (SEIVW = 0.077), PIVW = 0.043; Supplementary Table S8, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). However, given there is no evidence of a causal effect of maternal B12 levels on offspring birthweight, it is unlikely that B12 levels mediate the relationship between maternal folate levels and offspring birthweight.\n\nLast, we did not find any evidence of a causal effect of maternal or fetal B12 or folate levels on gestational duration (Table 2). There was no evidence of directional pleiotropy from the MR Egger regression analysis or of heterogeneity between the causal estimates at each SNP (Maternal: Directional Pleiotropy: PB12 = 0.28, PFolate = 0.87; Heterogeneity: PB12 = 0.08, PFolate = 0.63; Fetal: Directional pleiotropy: PB12 = 0.59, PFolate = 0.38; Heterogeneity: PB12 = 0.12, PFolate = 0.21)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nAfter the extensive literature search, 53 articles were found in PubMed and Embase databases that concern genetic variants in LV patients. By carefully reviewing the full texts of these 53 articles, 30 were enrolled that complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1). A total of 265 patients, of whom 78 were male (29.43%) and 187 were female (70.57%) giving a female to male ratio of 2.4:1, were tested for at least one out of the following six genetic variants, MTHFR C677T and A1298C, PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G and A844G, and Prothrombin G20210A and Factor V G1691A. The mean patient age was 35.74 years (range: 12–87 years). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Hind III restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), or sequencing. The ref SNP ID, location, and affected function are summarised in Table 2.\n\n SNPs \n\nMTHFR C677T\n\nThirteen articles presented LV patients that were examined for MTHFR C677T, although one article referred vaguely to its heterozygosity or homozygosity. A total of 129 patients were tested for MTHFR C677T, of which 46 had the heterozygous CT genotype (35.66%) and 25 had the homozygous TT genotype (19.38%). Thus, the total carrier rate of MTHFR C677T was 55.04% (71/129).\n\nMTHFR A1298C\n\nThere were only two studies and one case report concerning MTHFR A1298C in LV patients. In all, 82 LV patients were tested for MTHFR A1298C. Twenty‐nine patients had the AC genotype (a heterozygous carrier rate of 35.67%) and seven had the CC genotype (a homozygous carrier rate of 8.54%). The carrier rate of MTHFR A1298C was 43.90% (36/82).\n\nPAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G\n\nThree studies and two case reports presented assessment of PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G in a total of 95 LV patients. Twenty‐eight of 95 LV patients (29.47%) displayed the homozygous 4G/4G genotype, whereas 53 of 95 LV patients (55.79%) showed the heterozygous 4G/5G genotype. The total carrier rate of PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G was 85.26% (81/95), which was the highest carrier rate among the assessed SNPs.\n\nPAI‐1 A844G\n\nCompared to PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G, the variant PAI‐1 A844G has been rarely assessed in LV patients. Only two articles, including one study and one case report, have reported a total of 18 LV patients tested for PAI‐1 A844G. Fifty percent of tested LV patients (9/18) had the heterozygous AG genotype, while only one tested LV patient (5.56%) was homozygous for the GG genotype. The carrier rate of PAI‐1 A844G was 55.56% (10/18).\n\nProthrombin G20210A\n\nEighty‐five LV patients from 15 studies or case reports were evaluated for Prothrombin G20210A, while patients from another three studies were excluded because of vague descriptions of heterozygosity or homozygosity. The total carrier rate of Prothrombin G20210A was 10.59% (9/85), which was the lowest carrier rate of the six SNPs assessed. All the LV patients with Prothrombin G20210A displayed a heterozygous GA genotype (9/85); no homozygous AA carrier was identified (0/85).\n\nFactor V G1691A\n\nThe total carrier rate of Factor V G1691A (14.07%) in LV patients was the second lowest among the tested SNPs. From 23 articles, 135 LV patients were tested. In one study heterozygosity or homozygosity was not clearly stated; however, the remaining studies showed 19 patients to have the heterozygous GA genotype and no patients to have the homozygous AA genotype (0/135).\n\nRegional distribution\n\nMost articles did not refer in detail to the ethnicity or race of patients; therefore, we tried to determine the association between regions and genotypes in LV patients, which may provide clues for relationships between ethnicity and genotypes in LV. Patients were identified from 17 countries and 5 continents involving Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania (Table 3). The heterozygous, homozygous, and total carrier rates of each SNP are summarised in Table 4.\n\nAsia\n\nIn Asia, there were 11 studies or case reports from eight countries including China, Japan, Singapore, Lebanon, Turkey, India, South Korea, and Afghanistan. A total of 115 LV patients, of whom 36 were male (31.30%) and 79 were female (68.70%), with a mean age of 27.26 years were evaluated. The variant carriers were for 51.15% for MTHFR C677T, 43.86% for MTHFR A1298C, 82.9% for PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G, 1.67% for Prothrombin G20210A, and 6.45% in Factor V G1691A. The PAI‐1 A844G polymorphism has not yet been tested in Asian populations.\n\nEurope\n\nIn Europe, there were eight articles involving 49 LV patients from five countries, including Portugal, Spain, Britain, Germany, and France. The female to male ratio was 1.88:1, and the mean age of these LV patients was 40.43 years. The variant carrier rates were 64.28% for MTHFR C677T, 44% for MTHFR A1298C, 94.45% for PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G, 55.56% for PAI‐1 A844G, 15.79% for Prothrombin G20210A, and 21.74% for Factor V G1691A.\n\nNorth America\n\nIn North America, seven studies or case reports were enrolled; one article was partially excluded because of a lack of description of heterozygosity or homozygosity. Six out of the seven articles were conducted in America, the other was from Mexico. A total of 51 LV patients from North America, 13 males and 38 females with a mean age of 43 years, were tested for genetic variation. The total mutation carrier rates were 75% for Prothrombin G20210A and 28.57% for Factor V G1691A. There were only case reports for carriers of wild‐type MTHFR C677T and PAI‐1 ‐675 4G/5G. MTHFR A1298C and PAI‐1 A844G have not yet been tested in North America.\n\nSouth America\n\nThere were three studies conducted in South America, all in Brazil, and two of them only vaguely described mutations in MTHFR, Prothrombin G20210A, and Factor V G1691A, was and so were partially ignored. There were a total of 49 LV patients consisting of 12 males and 37 females, with a mean age of 33.17 years. The carrier rate of MTHFR C677T and Factor V G1691A was 64.29% and 17.14%, respectively.\n\nOceania\n\nIn Oceania, only one case report from Australia was identified. A 53‐year‐old female LV patient was tested for Prothrombin G20210A and Factor V G1691A and showed a heterozygous GA genotype for Prothrombin G20210A."

    "content": "Results\n\nGenotyping was performed for the 229 individuals. The results are summarized in Table 3. Not all of the samples were valid for all genotypes, because of that, the number of individuals can vary from one polymorphism to another.\n\nSerine Hidroximetil Transferase 1 gene (SHMT1)\n\nThis enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of serine to glycine, transferring methyl groups to tetrahydrofolate (THF), which is transformed into 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF). During cellular proliferation, this is the predominant pathway for pyrimidine synthesis (see Figure 1).\n\nFrom the four polymorphisms studied on the cytoplasmic SHMT1 in TMD patients, a significant increase was observed of the G allele of the polymorphism rs1979277 (Leu435Phe) when compared with controls (OR = 3.99; 95% CI 1.72, 9.25; p = 0,002). Regarding the polymorphism SHMT1 rs638416 of the promoter region (5'-UTR), a very significant increase was observed of the C allele and the CC genotype in TMD patients (OR = 2.80; 95% CI 1.51, 5.21; p = 0,013). Both polymorphisms are not linked, so their frequencies can be measured independently as a risk factor for TMD.\n\nMethylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 gene (MTHFD1)\n\nThe MTHFD1 gene encodes a protein that has three distinct enzyme activities: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate-synthetase. Each of these activities catalyzes one of three interconversion reactions of one-carbon derivatives of THF, which are substrates for the synthesis of methionine, thymidylate and purines. The trifunctional enzymatic activity is conferred by two larger domains: a terminal amino portion with dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities and a larger domain with synthetase activity.\n\nThe transition from G to A (rs2236225) in the MTHFD1 gene that results in an alteration of ARG-653-GLN is clinically associated with susceptibility to neural tube defects (NTDs) sensitive to folates. In our study, we found statistical differences in the alleles and genotypes frequencies between TMD patients and healthy controls. The T allele was more frequent in TMD patients (OR = 3.09; 95% CI 1.27, 7.50; p = 0,016).\n\nGlutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) gene\n\nThis gene encodes mu-class glutathione S-transferase. Its function is the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, drugs, toxins, and products of oxidative stress, by the conjugation with glutathione.\n\nThe GSTM1-null polymorphism is a deletion of the GSTM1 gene. The null variant of this gene has been associated with an increase of cancer and male infertility possibly due to greater susceptibility to environmental toxins and carcinogens as well as an alteration in the toxicity and efficiency of certain substances.\n\nOur study found a statistical increase (OR = 2.21; 95% CI 1.24, 4.36; p = 0.030) of the null variant in TMD patients compared to the control group.\n\nMethionine Synthase Reductase (MTRR) gene\n\nMTRR is responsible for the regeneration of Methionine Synthase (MTR) by reductive methylation using SAM as a methyl donor.\n\nThe substitution of A by G (rs1801394) in the encoding region is translated in Ile22Met. The G allele produces an enzyme with less affinity for the substrate. A statistical increase of the A allele (OR = 2.35; 95% CI 1.10, 5.00; p = 0.037) was observed in the TMD group.\n\nD4 receptor of Dopamine (DRD4) gene\n\nDRD4-48bptr is the 48-bp VNTR in exon 3 of the DRD4, which encodes the third intracellular receptor loop and presents between 2 to 11 repeats. According to the number of repetitions, we can characterize the polymorphism as the short allele S-DRD4 (2 to 5 repetitions) and the long allele L-DRD4 (6 or more repeats). It was observed statistical differences on genotype frequencies in both groups (p = 0,039), but no statistical increase (OR = 3.12; 95% IC 0.76, 17.26, p = 0.181) of the S-DRD4 allele was found in patient group. The LL genotype was not found in any of the individuals with TMD."

    "content": "Results\n\nComparison of serum folate measured by CDC MBA and CDC HPLC-MS/MS\n\nThe Pearson correlation between the 2 methods was very high (r = 0.999) for the 23 serum samples (Figure 1) and the agreement between the 2 methods was very good (Supplemental Table 1). On average (SD), the CDC MBA measured 0.46% (3.0%) higher than the CDC HPLC-MS/MS method. The CDC HPLC-MS/MS method showed lower imprecision for the 23 serum samples (1.2–4.0%) compared with the CDC MBA (7.0–15.0%).\n\nParticipating laboratories\n\nAll 8 laboratories reported results; 7 laboratories were international and 1 was from the US (Table 1). Two types of IH-CAL were used among laboratories, thus we separated the participants into group 1 (laboratories #2–#5) using 5-methylTHF and group 2 (laboratories #6–#9) using folic acid. Laboratory #3 used the wild-type strain of L. rhamnosus [ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) 7469], whereas the other laboratories used the chloramphenicol-resistant strain (NCIMB 10463); however, the source of their microorganism varied. All laboratories used a 96-well microplate format; some used manual pipetting, whereas others used a sample handler to dilute and pipette. Additional details on laboratory procedures were reported by the participants (Supplemental Table 2). All laboratories value-assigned their folate calibrators by spectrophotometry, at 290 nm for 5-methylTHF and 277–282 nm for folic acid. The culture medium is a critical reagent and was reported to be the same for all laboratories (Folic Acid Casei Medium). According to each procedure, samples were first diluted and then transferred into 96-well plates at 2 different concentrations. Three laboratories (#2, #3, and #9) used the CDC recommended sample dilutions of 1:100 for serum and 1:140 for whole-blood hemolysate, whereas other laboratories used their laboratory-specific dilutions. Most laboratories incubated assay plates at 37°C for 42–45 h, except for laboratory #3 which used only an 18-h incubation. Most laboratories used 590 nm to read plates and all laboratories reported that they carefully controlled the timing for plate reading to ensure consistency across all plates. Most laboratories used a polynomial regression (third-order) calibration curve fit, but other approaches were also reported.\n\nWithin-laboratory imprecision\n\nA smaller number of laboratories exceeded the 10% CV mark, an indicator for increased within-laboratory imprecision, when they used the CDC reagents (CDC-MO & CDC-CAL) compared with IH reagents (IH-MO & IH-CAL): 6 laboratories (#5 and #8 for S-FOL and #2, #3, #4, and #8 for WB-FOL) compared with 3 laboratories (#3, #4, and #8 for WB-FOL) (Table 2). Furthermore, the overall mean within-laboratory imprecision appeared to be smaller in the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition compared with the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition: 6.3% compared with 9.2% for S-FOL and 7.7% compared with 10.4% for WB-FOL. When only 1 of the 2 reagents was harmonized (conditions IH-MO & CDC-CAL and CDC-MO & IH-CAL), we observed intermediate imprecision estimates. The group mean within-laboratory imprecision was <10% regardless of condition and whether laboratories belonged to group 1 (5-methylTHF calibrator) or group 2 (folic acid calibrator), except for group 1 laboratories that used IH reagents (IH-MO & IH-CAL; 11.2% for S-FOL; 12.9% for WB-FOL) or their IH microorganism (IH-MO & CDC-CAL; 10.2% for S-FOL; 11.2% for WB-FOL).\n\nAgreement across laboratories\n\nWhen we grouped the raw results by laboratory and condition and displayed the distribution of concentrations, there was more variability among the laboratories (wider range of results and fluctuations in the median) under the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition and less variability under the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition, for both S-FOL (Supplemental Figure 2) and WB-FOL (Supplemental Figure 3). Similarly, the geometric mean concentrations spanned a wider range for the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition (23.2–37.6 nmol/L for S-FOL and 267–521 nmol/L for WB-FOL) compared with the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition (27.1–36.2 nmol/L for S-FOL and 315–498 nmol/L for WB-FOL) (Table 3). Larger apparent differences were observed between the means for group 1 (5-methylTHF calibrator) and group 2 (folic acid calibrator) laboratories under the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition (30.2 nmol/L compared with 35.3 nmol/L for S-FOL and 428 nmol/L compared with 469 nmol/L for WB-FOL) compared with the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition (29.8 nmol/L compared with 30.7 nmol/L for S-FOL and 393 nmol/L compared with 418 nmol/L for WB-FOL). The 2 mixed conditions, IH-MO & CDC-CAL and CDC-MO & IH-CAL, generally showed intermediate results. The mean laboratory results when laboratories used CDC reagents appeared to be closer to the CDC MBA target concentrations (27.0 nmol/L for S-FOL and 358 nmol/L for WB-FOL) than when they used IH reagents. We also noticed an improvement in the overall variance (SD) of the geometric means from the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition to the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition (5.38 nmol/L compared with 3.30 nmol/L for S-FOL and 67.5 nmol/L compared with 46.1 nmol/L for WB-FOL). Lastly, the log transformed results for the 23 serum and whole-blood samples sorted by increasing CDC MBA target concentration displayed the same pattern; the IH-MO & IH-CAL condition showed a separation between results from group 1 and group 2 laboratories, whereas the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition generated more comparable results (Supplemental Figure 4).\n\nEstimated effect size and variability due to differences in microorganism and calibrator\n\nWe estimated the magnitude of the pooled effects of each of the test conditions, such as the day, microorganism, and calibrator (Table 4). The model estimated a small day effect of ~5% for S-FOL and ~2% for WB-FOL, with day 1 results being lower than day 2 results. The overall microorganism effect (averaging across calibrators) was also small, but the large 95% CIs attested to the underlying variability within and among laboratories: S-FOL 2.28% (−11.4%, 18.1%) and WB-FOL 2.25% (−10.0%, 16.2%). The overall calibrator effect (averaging across microorganisms) was small when 5-methylTHF as IH-CAL was compared with CDC-CAL (also 5-methylTHF), but again showed large 95% CIs: S-FOL −2.33% (−20.7%, 20.3%) and WB-FOL −0.212% (−16.2%, 18.8%). The overall calibrator was large and also showed large 95% CIs when folic acid as IH-CAL was compared with 5-methylTHF calibrator: S-FOL 12.1% (−2.08%, 28.4%) and WB-FOL 14.7% (0.438%, 31.0%).\n\nThe among-laboratory variability was evaluated for 6 test conditions by separating the IH-CAL condition into either 5-methylTHF or folic acid (Table 5). The model estimated the lowest (~10%) variability for S-FOL and WB-FOL when laboratories used both CDC reagents. The condition with the highest variability was when IH-MO and 5-methylTHF as IH-CAL were used (21.9% for S-FOL; 17.9% for WB-FOL).\n\nDifference compared with CDC MBA target values\n\nThe model-estimated relative difference in S-FOL compared with the CDC MBA target value varied greatly by laboratory and in most cases also by condition (Figure 2A). However, laboratories #3 and to some extent #7 showed little variation by condition. On the other hand, laboratories #2, #4, and #8 showed a clear microorganism effect, whereas laboratories #5 and #9 showed a calibrator effect. We observed different patterns for the model-estimated relative difference in WB-FOL compared with the CDC MBA target value (Figure 3A). Laboratories #2, #4, and to some extent #7 showed little variation by condition. On the other hand, laboratory #3 showed a microorganism effect, whereas laboratories #8 and #9 showed a clear calibrator effect. When we grouped results by condition (Figure 2B for S-FOL; Figure 3B for WB-FOL), all laboratories under the CDC-MO & CDC-CAL condition were estimated to achieve on average results within ±20% of the CDC MBA target value except for laboratory #6 (34% higher for S-FOL and 38% higher for WB-FOL) (Supplemental Table 3). Laboratories #2, #4, #7, and #8 obtained, on average, results within 10% of the CDC MBA target, for both S-FOL and WB-FOL. For group 1 laboratories (5-methylTHF calibrator), the mean difference to the CDC MBA target value was estimated to be 21% for S-FOL and 18% for WB-FOL with the use of IH reagents. This decreased to an estimated 9.9% for S-FOL and 9.0% for WB-FOL with the use of CDC reagents. For group 2 laboratories (folic acid calibrator), the mean difference to the CDC MBA target value was 30% for S-FOL and 30% for WB-FOL with the use of IH reagents. This decreased to 13% for S-FOL and 16% for WB-FOL with the use of CDC reagents. Overall, when all laboratories used IH reagents, the mean ± SD difference to the CDC MBA target value decreased from 22% ± 20% for S-FOL and 25% ± 19% for WB-FOL to 12% ± 12% for S-FOL and 13% ± 13% for WB-FOL with the use of CDC reagents. When only 1 of the 2 reagents was harmonized, we observed an intermediate estimated mean difference to the CDC MBA target value as well as an intermediate SD.\n\nHarmonized condition\n\nThe limits of agreement indicate the range within which 95% of the results are expected to be when compared with the CDC MBA target value (Figure 4A) when the laboratories used CDC reagents. We found overall reasonable agreement among laboratories (limits of agreement including 1) under the harmonized condition when all laboratories used the same microorganism and calibrator provided in the CDC round-robin kit (CDC-MO & CDC-CAL) except for laboratories #6 and #9. For all other laboratories, 95% of the results were predicted to be between ~30% lower and ~50% higher than the CDC MBA target value, regardless of the matrix. Furthermore, with the harmonized condition it can be expected that the differences between 2 d of analysis would be approximately ±10–30% for S-FOL and approximately ±20–40% for WB-FOL (Figure 4B). Laboratory #8 results for WB-FOL showed a lack of agreement between day 1 and day 2."

    "content": "Results\n\n Genetic association outcomes \n\nFor, rs1695 polymorphism, our data from genotypes distribution showed no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in our study for both case and control groups. The distribution of alleles and genotypes of rs1695 polymorphism are summarized in Table 1. After analysis, we found that the frequency of genotypes AA, AG, and GG for controls is 50.00%, 44.00%, and 06.00%, respectively. While these ratios were calculated 37.00%, 49.00%, and 14.00%, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed that the homozygote genotype GG is associated with increased risk of breast cancer (OR= 3.1532, 95%CI= 1.1072 to 8.9798, p= 0.0315) but AG genotype was not associated with the risk of breast cancer (OR= 1.5049, 95%CI= 0.8354 to 2.7109, p= 0.1734). Although carriers of allele G had high frequency in the patient population, this difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, allele analysis revealed that the allele G is associated with the increased risk of breast cancer (OR= 1.6098, 95%CI= 1.0577 to 2.4500, p= 0.0263).\n\nFor, rs1138272 polymorphism, our data from genotypes distribution showed no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for both case and control groups. The distribution of alleles and genotypes of rs1138272 polymorphism are summarized in Table 2. After analysis, we found that the frequency of genotypes CC, CT, and TT for controls is 92.00%, 08.00%, and 00.00%, respectively. While these ratios for cases were calculated 88.00%, 11.00%, and 01.00%, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed that the homozygote TT (OR= 3.1356, 95%CI= 0.1260 to 78.0014, p= 0.4858) and heterozygote CT (OR= 1.4375, 95%CI= 0.5524 to 3.7411, p= 0.4571) genotype are not associated with risk of breast cancer. Also, the carriers of allele T had no high frequency in the patient population compared to controls. Moreover, allele analysis revealed that the allele T is not associated with the risk of breast cancer (OR= 1.6684, 95%CI= 0.6760 to 4.1180, p= 0.2668).\n\n In silico analysis  \n\nWe evaluated the effects of Ile105Val single nucleotide polymorphism on the GSTP1 function by SNPeffects online software. Our data revealed that based on the TANGO model, the Ile105Val SNP does not influence the aggregation tendency of our studied protein as well as LIMBO analysis, the mentioned SNP does not affect the chaperone binding tendency of GSTP1 protein. But, based on WALTZ output, we found that the Ile105Val polymorphism decreases the amyloid propensity of the GSTP1 enzyme. WALTZ algorithm specifically and accurately predicts amyloid-forming areas in the sequences of protein. The overall WALTZ value for CSTP1 estimated 906.54 and mutations/variations could elevate (dWALTZ >50), reduce (dWALTZ <-50) or not influence amyloid propensity (dWALTZ between -50 and 50). In our analysis, dWALTZ was calculated -228.00 which means that the polymorphism reduces the amyloid propensity of the GSTP1. In Figures 1 and 2, the location of the WALTZ stretches in the normal type and mutant enzyme are shown, demonstrate by correspondingly a bar or profile illustration. The short stretches are recorded for both mutant and wild type (Table 3). To compare the influence of the SNP to the wild type, we also display a Difference outline (Figure 3), that plans the difference between wild and mutant protein."

    "content": "3. Results\n\n3.1. Geographical Distribution of Three Prevalent Pathogenic Variants\n\nAmong 715 unrelated WD patients, p.R778L, p.P992L and p.T935M were the three most prevalent pathogenic variants. Their allelic frequency was 31.7, 15.7 and 6.6%, respectively, which was close to what we reported previously. Among 709 patients with geographical information, as shown in Figure 1a, the majority (579, 81.7%) were from southeastern China. Five regions accounted for the main proportion, in the order of Fujian province (261, 36.8%), Zhejiang (168, 23.7%), Jiangsu (71, 10.0%), Shanghai (56, 7.9%) and Jiangxi (43, 6.1%). Then, we compared the allelic frequency of three prevalent variants in these regions. There was no obvious difference in the allelic frequency of p.R778L among these regions (Figure 1b). For p.P992L, though its allelic frequency in Jiangxi (19/86, 22.1%) was significantly higher than that of Zhejiang (33/336, 9.8%) (p < 0.01), no other difference among the regions was seen (Figure 1c). However, as shown in Figure 1d, we found that the allelic frequency of p.T935M in Fujian (71/522, 13.6%) was significantly higher than that of Zhejiang (15/336, 4.5%), Jiangsu (1/142, 0.7%), Shanghai (0/112, 0.0%) or Jiangxi (2/86, 2.3%) (p < 0.01), impressively indicating the tendency for aggregation.\n\n3.2. Linkage Disequilibrium at Three Markers for Three Prevalent Pathogenic Variants\n\nAmong 102 WD patients with the three prevalent pathogenic variants, biallelic variants were identified in each of them and successfully segregated in the corresponding relatives. There were 74 patients with c.2333G > T (p.R778L), 27 with c.2975C > T (p.P992L) and 13 with c.2804C > T (p.T935M). Among them, 26 patients were with homozygous p.R778L, two with homozygous p.P992L, one with homozygous p.T935M, eight with p.R778L and p.P992L, and four with p.R778L and p.T935M. The rest were all compound heterozygotes with one of the three prevalent variants and other variants. \n\nTo clarify the association of each specific marker with the variants, we firstly observed the allele distribution of p.R778L, p.P992L and p.T935M at each marker. The allele size definition for the three microsatellite markers (D13S314, D13S301, D13S316) used was based on a previous study. In total, there were 100 chromosomes with p.R778L, 29 with p.P992L, 14 with p.T935M and 177 normal chromosomes in this study. As shown in Figure 2a, D13S314 exhibited significant linkage disequilibrium at allele 10 for chromosomes with p.R778L (98.0%) and p.P992L (82.8%) vs. control ones (26.0%, p < 0.01), while entirely linked at allele 12 for p.T935M (100 vs. 37.3%, p < 0.01). In terms of D13S301, we found the significant association of p.R778L with both allele 7 (65.0 vs. 36.7%, p < 0.01) and allele 8 (33.0 vs. 9.6%, p < 0.01), p.P992L with allele 9 (79.3 vs. 6.2%, p < 0.01) and p.T935M with allele 4 (78.6 vs. 20.3%, p < 0.01), respectively (Figure 2b). As shown in Figure 2c, D13S316 exhibited significant linkage distribution at allele 7 for p.R778L (89.0 vs. 7.9%, p < 0.01), allele 5 for p.P992L (86.2 vs. 43.5%, p < 0.01) and allele 8 for p.T935M (100.0 vs. 39.0%, p < 0.01). These results revealed that all three prevalent pathogenic variants had great linkage disequilibrium at each microsatellite marker, which might contribute to the haplotype association.\n\n3.3. Haplotype Association of Three Prevalent Pathogenic Variants\n\nWith the alleles acquired at three microsatellite markers, we constructed the haplotypes for three prevalent pathogenic variants in 102 patients and found haplotype–variant correlations (Table 1). In light of the possibility that the new allele could be obtained through slippage during DNA replication from generation to generation, haplotypes differing by no more than one repeat unit at a single marker were gathered to one group.\n\nThe most prevalent pathogenic variant in China, p.R778L, was found to associate with three haplogroups (A, B, C). Haplogroup A was overwhelmingly common on WD chromosomes (97/100, 97.0%) vs. control ones (17/177, 9.6%, p < 0.01). It could be subsequently subdivided into haplotype variants A1–A4 (10-7-7; 10-7-8; 10-8-7; 10-8-8) and variant A1 (10-7-7) accounted for the largest proportion (57.0%). Haplogroup B (10-7-9) and C (12-5-7; 12-6-7) were found to be relatively scarce (1.0 and 2.0%, respectively) when compared with haplogroup A, suggesting that haplogroup A could exactly represent almost all the genetic information of p.R778L. \n\nHowever, the haplotype spectrum of p.P992L was more complex, including six haplogroups (D, E, F, G, H, I). Among them, haplogroup E was more common on WD chromosomes (21/29, 72.4%) than control ones (6/177, 3.4%, p < 0.01). It contained two variants (E1, E2), among which variant E1 (10-9-5) occupied the main part (69.0%) and variant E2 (10-9-6) was only found on one WD chromosome (3.4%). Haplogroup D (9-7-5), F (10-9-8), G (10-11-5), H (12-4-5; 12-5-5) and I (12-5-8) appeared sporadically, accounting for 3.4, 6.9, 3.4, 10.3 and 3.4% on WD chromosomes, respectively. Contrary to p.P992L, p.T935M presented a uniform state. There was only one kind of haplogroup on WD chromosomes, haplogroup J, which consisted of two variants J1 (12-4-8) and J2 (12-5-8), showing great significance vs. control ones (100 vs. 15.3%, p < 0.01). Additionally, variant J1 (12-4-8) was more common (78.6%)."

    "content": "Results\n\nPatients with incomplete clinical or genotypic data required to run any of the algorithms were excluded. This resulted in 129 patients remaining in the analysis. Demographic, clinical, and genetic variables for all study participants in the validation cohort are summarized on Table 2. The mean therapeutic warfarin dose was 46.9 mg/week (SD±17.2) and more than half of our patients (59.7%) were started on warfarin due to DVT/PE. We combined rs1799853, rs1057910, rs28371686, rs7900194, rs28371685,(CYP2C9*2, *3, *5, *8, and *11) into a CYP2C9 star variant group due to low frequency of the individual SNPs, each of which reduces CYP2C9 activity. None of the SNPs showed deviations from HWE at P<0.001. The minor allele frequencies for rs1799853, rs1057910, and rs9923231 were low (0.02, 0.02, and 0.06 respectively), consistent with previous studies.\n\nWe tested the accuracy of the three algorithms in our AA validation cohort by comparing the predicted dose requirements with the actual maintenance dose for each patient. Comparisons of our novel AA algorithm to the IWPC algorithms are shown in Table 3. The mean predicted dose utilizing our novel AA algorithm was much closer to the actual mean therapeutic dose (47.6 and 46.9 mg/week, respectively) and the difference between the mean predicted dose and mean therapeutic dose was not significant (p = 0.76). The predicted mean doses for the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms were found to be significantly lower (p = 0.004 and p = 3.3× 10−22, respectively) than the mean therapeutic dose (Table 3). Furthermore, the MAE with the novel AA algorithm (10.9 [SE ±0.92]) was lower than the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms (12.2 [SE ±0.98], and 17.9 [SE ±1.2] mg/week, respectively). We found the correlation between the observed and the predicted dose was strongest for the novel AA algorithm (r = 0.51) and the proportion of variability in warfarin dosage explained by the variables included in the algorithm was the highest (R2 = 0.27). The correlation between predicted and observed doses for both the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms were similar (0.38 and 0.41, respectively) as well as the proportion of variability explained (R2 = 0.15 and 0.16, respectively), consistent with the findings by the IWPC in their AA cohort (R2 = 0.19).\n\nBoth of the IWPC algorithms tended to under-predict warfarin doses while the novel AA algorithm over-predicted doses (Figure 1). However, approximately 38% of warfarin doses that were over-predicted by the novel AA algorithm were below 10mg/week (Figure 1A). While the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm over or under-predicted warfarin doses by up to 10mg/week in approximately 53% of patients (Figure 1B). The IWPC clinical algorithm under-predicted warfarin doses for the majority of patients (86.8%), with 33% being under estimated by 10–20 mg/week (Figure 1C). Our novel AA algorithm was able to predict the exact therapeutic dose in 10.9% of patients compared to 2.3% (p = 0.02) and none for the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms, respectively (Table 3 and Figure 1). Previous warfarin algorithms have used the target prediction range of within 20% of the observed dose to assess algorithm performance. We found that nearly 60% of predicted doses from our novel AA algorithm were within this 20% range compared to 48.8% and 26.4% for the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms, respectively (Table 3).\n\nMost of the patients who are incorrectly dosed when using standard initiation doses require low or high warfarin doses, therefore it is important to analyze the performance of the algorithms in the extreme dose subgroups. Hence, we examined the predictive accuracy of the novel AA algorithm for patients requiring low (<40 mg/week), intermediate (40–50 mg/week), and high (>50 mg/week) dosing regimens (Figure 2). For patients requiring low doses, all three algorithms demonstrate similar predictive power. However, the MAE was lowest for the novel AA algorithm at 3.0 mg/week (SE ±0.48) compared to the IWPC pharmacogenomics (3.8 mg/week, SE ±0.58) and clinical algorithms (3.8 mg/week, SE ±0.45). Among patients in the intermediate dose group, the novel AA algorithm and the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm performed similarly with 82% and 84% of predicted doses within the 20% range respectively while the performance of the IWPC clinical algorithm begins to drop drastically with only 15.8% of warfarin doses predicted within the same range (Figure 2). For patients in the high dose group, the novel AA algorithm significantly out performs both of the IWPC algorithms (Figure 2). We found the novel AA algorithm was able to correctly detect the greatest percentage of high-dose patients (53%), whereas the IWPC pharmacogenomics and clinical algorithms correctly assigned 26% and 2%, respectively, of patients in this group. Overall, predicted doses derived from the novel AA algorithm were closer to the observed doses for more patients and the precision was higher as demonstrated by the consistently lower MAE. To determine the clinical benefit of incorporating our novel AA algorithm into practice versus using the IWPC clinical algorithm, we computed the NNG. In order to prevent one predicted dose from being outside of the 20% therapeutic dose range (event), it was estimated that approximately three patients would need to be genotyped (Table 4).\n\nSelf-reported race for AAs is not a strong proxy for genetic background and the availability of AIMs has made it possible to accurately measure admixture in AAs. Therefore, we examined how well our novel AA algorithm performs given the broad range of WAA among AAs. Overall among the doses predicted within a 20% range, mean percent WAA was not significantly different between the algorithms. For the IWPC pharmacogenomics algorithm, however, linear regression analysis revealed a strong inverse correlation between percent WAA and predicted dose within the 20% therapeutic dose range for patients requiring doses ≥60 mg/week (β = −2.04, p = 0.02) (Table 5). The correlation is also higher compared to our novel AA algorithm (r = 0.41 and r = 0.25, respectively). As expected, our novel AA algorithm did not show association because population-specific variables are incorporated and therefore may account for WAA."

    "content": "Results\n\nDescriptive characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. The mean (± sd) age of participants was 65.6 ± 8.5 years, with 68.3% of the participants being male and 93.3% white. The mean (± sd) concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D were 27.7 ± 11.4 ng/ml and 33.9 ± 11.3 pg/ml, respectively. A total of 519 (43.7%) individuals had a recurrent adenoma during study follow-up, and 28.6% of those had an advanced adenoma recurrence. Of adenoma recurrences, 28.1% were in the distal colorectum only; 45.9% were in the proximal colon, and 26.0% of those who had a recurrence had adenomas in both locations. Supplemental Table 1 presents the genomic location of SNPs, along with respective allele frequencies and genotype missing rates.\n\nTable 2 shows the mean concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D by each CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 SNP genotype. A suggestive relationship between the CYP24A1 SNP rs927650 and concentrations of 25(OH)D was observed, with levels of 26.9 ± 8.5, 27.5 ± 12.8, and 29.1 ± 11.3 for the CC, TC, and TT genotypes, respectively. The results for the association between SNPs, overall colorectal adenoma recurrence, and advanced adenoma recurrence are presented in Table 3. There was a nominally statistically significant association between the CYP24A1 SNP rs927650 and odds for any adenoma recurrence, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.30 (0.99–1.70) and 1.38 (1.01–1.89) for each additional copy of the T allele, as compared to wild-type homozygotes (p-trend=0.04). In addition, there was a statistically significant relationship between the CYP24A1 SNP rs35051736 and odds for advanced recurrence (p<0.0001); this association arose because the minor allele (A) was completely absent in individuals with advanced lesions (n=162).\n\nTable 4 shows the results for the associations between CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 SNPs and features of advanced colorectal adenoma recurrence. There was a nominally statistically significant association between increasing number of copies of the G allele in CYP24A1 rs2296241 and higher odds for recurrent adenomas with villous histology, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.19 (0.68–2.06) and 1.98 (1.12–3.50) for AG and GG genotypes, respectively, compared to AA (p-trend=0.02). Further, the minor allele for the CYP24A1 SNP rs35051736 was again absent among those presenting with a large or villous adenoma upon follow-up; however, these findings did not reach statistical significance.\n\nWe next sought to determine whether there were interactions between SNPs in CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 and vitamin D metabolite concentrations in relation to adenoma recurrence. Logistic regression analyses revealed nominally statistically significant interactions between CYP24A1 SNP rs2296241 and 25(OH)D (p-interaction=0.10), and rs2762939 in the same gene and 1,25(OH)2D (p-interaction=0.10). Further exploration of these interactions is presented in Table 5. The results suggest that increasing concentrations of 25(OH)D were significantly associated with reduced odds for adenoma recurrence only among those with at least one copy of the minor allele in rs2296241. Among individuals with the AA genotype, the ORs (95% CIs) for adenoma recurrence were 0.84 (0.27–2.61) for those with inadequate 25(OH)D concentrations (≥12 and <20 ng/ml) and 0.78 (0.27–2.30) for those with adequate levels (>20 ng/ml), respectively, compared to participants with vitamin D deficiency (<12 ng/ml). For heterozygotes, the ORs (95% CIs) were 0.23 (0.07–0.72) and 0.21 (0.07–0.62) for those who were inadequate and adequate, respectively, compared to deficient individuals. Finally, compared to those who were vitamin D deficient, participants who were homozygous for the minor allele and who had inadequate 25(OH)D concentrations had an OR (95% CI) of 0.13 (0.02–0.68) for adenoma recurrence; while those who were adequate had an OR (95% CI) of 0.18 (0.03–0.91). With regard to CYP24A1 rs2762939, the results suggest only a modestly reduced odds for adenoma recurrence among those with higher concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D and at least one copy of the minor allele."

    "content": "Results\n\nHRMA\n\nFor HRMA set up, available samples with known CYP24A1 status were used as positive and wild-type (wt) controls. In details, n = 2 samples with the c.428_430delAAG variant and n = 2 samples with the c.1186C > T variant (homozygous and heterozygous). Two samples with no CYP24A1 variants were used as wt controls. Furthermore, we also included n = 1 compound heterozygous sample, carrying both variants tested. As above mentioned, the two sets of primers have been designed ad hoc to amplify two different target sequences and, consequently, each amplicon are indicative of only one common mutant site in CYP24A1 gene. The Tm difference between the two wt amplicons was at least 6 °C and, consequently, the associated Tm profiles did not overlap (Fig. 1). Due to these melting characteristics and behavior, the two HRMA could be performed and analyzed at same time in a duplex assay.\n\nFor all samples, the genotype assignment obtained by dHRMA was concordant with results of single plex HRMA and Sanger sequencing. In fact, we were able to clearly genotype all samples by evaluating their specific melting profiles along with the Tm values. The different CYP24A1 genotypes exhibit a specific melting behavior, as observed in both Normalized and Temperature-shifted and Different Plot (Fig. 2). Because the Tms of the two amplicons were clearly different, in each sample we can observe two different genotyping curves, each related to one locus. In detail, the melting peaks of rs777676129 amplicons were: 85.14 °C, 84.68 °C and 85.35 °C for wt, heterozygous and homozygous genotypes, respectively. The rs114368325 amplicons showed Tm of 79.37 °C, 78.69 °C and 78.81 °C of wt, heterozygous and homozygous genotypes, respectively. Furthermore, we were also able to identify the compound heterozygosis by evaluating its specific melting profile (Fig. 3) as well as the Tm shift compared to the wt ones (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 4, all genotypes were clearly distinguishable from wt sample.\n\nMoreover, all genotypes obtained from the duplex HRMA were confirmed by sequencing.\n\nValidation and sensitivity of HRMA\n\nTo validate our protocol, duplex-PCR/HRMA was performed on further 10 DNA samples with the suspicion of IIH. Among of these, we found 1 heterozygous for the c.428_430delAAG and 1 heterozygous for the c.1186C > T variants. All HRMA results were verified by direct DNA sequencing, which confirmed all the genotypes, achieving 100% of concordance.\n\nWe evaluated the intra-assay precision analyzing 5 replicates of one single wild-type and homozygous/heterozygous samples, respectively. Furthermore, the inter-assay precision was assessed running the same wild-type, homozygous and heterozygous samples in triplicates on 3 different PCR/HRM experiments. We achieved a full superimposability and reproducibility of melting profiles and Tm.\n\nIn order to test the sensitivity of HRMA, we evaluated serial dilutions (1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16) of wt, homozygous and heterozygous DNAs, starting from 15 ng/μL. Melting curves of positive samples were still well differentiated as compared to wt ones, until the lowest variant allele frequency investigated (data not shown)."

A brain MRI at 20 months of age showed atrophy and delayed myelination (Fig. 1). Clinical neurophysiology studies were normal, showing median nerve compound motor action potentials of 6.5 mV at the L wrist and 5.5 mV at the L elbow (normal value for 1–2 yr old infants: ≥3.5 mV), and median nerve conduction velocity of 50 m/s (normal value for 1–2 yr old infants: ≥35 m/s). Median nerve sensory action potential was 36 μV (normal value for 1–2 yr old infants: ≥15 μV).\n\nBiochemical Findings\n\nTable I summarizes biochemical findings in the proband. His serum copper level was normal. Urine b2-microglobulin, a marker of renal tubular injury due to copper overload that is elevated in patients with Menkes disease, was also normal. Plasma catecholamine ratios, which reflect deficient activity of dopamine-b-hydroxylase, a copper-dependent enzyme, were not consistent with Menkes disease. In contrast, cerebrospinal fluid copper and catecholamine ratios fell within the ranges established for classical Menkes disease (Table I).\n\nMolecular Analyses\n\nWe confirmed mosaicism for the P1001L mutation in the proband’s genomic DNA (data not shown). The mutant allele was not detected in the mother. P1001L creates a novel BsmAI restriction site (Fig. 2A). PCR and BsmAI digestion indicated a different level of mosaicism in the patient’s blood compared to that in a primary fibroblast culture obtained from his skin biopsy. The wild type allele (294 bp fragment) was markedly less abundant in the latter tissue compared to the patient’s blood DNA and that from a normal control (Fig. 2B). We used densitometry to estimate the relative proportions of fragments associated with the wild type and mutant alleles in both tissues which indicated a wild type: mutant allele ratios of 77:23 in whole blood DNA and 12:88 in fibroblast DNA. We also used quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) experiments to compare mosaicism between tissues, which produced similar results, a wild type: mutant ratio of 69:31 in blood versus 12:88 in primary fibroblasts (Table I). The control for completeness of BsmA1 digestion (ATP7A exon 7) by Q-RT-PCR indicated 99% digestion in these experiments."

    "content": "Results\n\nCaco-2 cells do not express deiodinase at a level detectable by enzyme assay. Following transfection of Caco-2 cells with rat IDI coding sequences linked to the GPX4 3′UTR with either the T (IDI-T) or C (IDI-C) variant corresponding to rs713041, IDI transcripts were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time PCR using primers specific to rat IDI that did not detect human IDI sequences in untransfected Caco-2 cells (results not shown). For both variants there was an up to 10-fold range of expression of the transgene between the various clones. Since the two variants differ only in the 3′UTR, assessment of their relative effects was carried out in clones selected on the basis that they expressed IDI-T and IDI-C transcripts at comparable levels. In the first series of experiments two clones expressing IDI-T and two expressing IDI-C transcripts at similar levels were selected and the mean IDI transcript levels (as arbitrary units relative to GAPDH) in the clones studied were 0.51 ± 0.1 and 0.30 ± 0.1 for the IDI-T and IDI-C cells respectively.\n\nOverall cell viability of the cells was assessed after an oxidative challenge without distinguishing between necrotic and apoptotic cell death. In order to allow us to carry out such experiments without lengthening periods of altered Se supply, viability was measured within hours of the challenge. When grown in normal medium untransfected Caco-2 cells showed considerable resistance to tert-butylhydroperoxide and a concentration of 3 mM was chosen as the challenge since it led to approximately 50% cell viability under these conditions. In Se-depleted medium a lower concentration of tert-butylhydroperoxide was used as the challenge because of the additional sensitivity of the cells. Viability was measured in cells grown in normal culture medium 4 hours after challenge with tert-butylhydroperoxide. In unchallenged conditions, cells over-expressing either IDI-T or IDI-C transcripts showed lower cell viability compared with untransfected cells (data not shown). The transfected cells showed lower viability over a range of tert-butylhydroperoxide concentrations with 40–60% viability when challenged with 1–5 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide. The fall in cell viability after a challenge with 3 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide was significantly greater in cells expressing IDI-C compared with those expressing the IDI-T (p = 0.006, Fig. 1A). One explanation of this effect is that the T and C variant 3′UTRs compete for available Se and selenocysteine incorporation machinery to different extents and so divert Se from synthesis of antioxidant selenoproteins to synthesis of the IDI transgene (which has no antioxidant function) differentially. To test this, measurements of ROS and selenoprotein levels were carried out.\n\nIn order to measure ROS levels following tert-butylhydroperoxide treatment it was necessary to use a lower concentration of the oxidant. Challenge of the cells with 100 μM tert-butylhydroperoxide led to measurable increases in total reactive oxygen species (ROS) after 4 hours but retained cell viability. When IDI-C and IDI-T cells were grown in normal culture medium and challenged with tert-butylhydroperoxide there was a greater increase in levels of ROS in IDI-C cells compared with IDI-T cells (p = 0.053; Fig. 1B) and this difference suggested that the IDI-C cells were under greater oxidative stress. When grown in normal medium the IDI-C cells showed a significantly lower GPx activity compared with the IDI-T cells but levels of TR1 and GPx4 were similar (Fig. 2A). Real-time PCR showed mean levels of TR1, GPx1 and GPx4 mRNAs to be similar in the IDI-T and IDI-C cells but levels of selenoprotein H mRNA were significantly lower in IDI-C cells compared with IDI-T (Fig. 2B).\n\nTo assess the impact of the T/C variants on the selenoprotein hierarchy under conditions of different Se supply, measurements of selenoprotein expression were made in clones grown in Se-depleted and Se-supplemented media. As shown in Fig. 3, in both sets of transfected cells GPx activity, TR1 protein and GPx4 protein levels were 80–90% lower in Se-depleted compared with Se-supplemented cells. Notably the levels, particularly for GPx activity, were similar in cells grown in Se-depleted and cells grown in normal media (DMEM with 10% serum), and we speculate that since GPx1 activity is a sensitive marker of Se status the normal medium used in these experiments was low in Se. In Se-depleted conditions there was no significant difference in GPx activity, TR1 protein or GPx4 protein levels between ID1-C and IDI-T cells. When the cells were grown in Se-supplemented medium the IDI-C cells showed a higher content of GPx4 protein compared with the IDI-T cells (Fig. 3). This suggests that when sufficient Se is present there is a greater increase in GPx4 in IDI-C cells. Real-time PCR showed mean levels of TR1, GPx1 and GPx4 mRNAs to be similar in the IDI-T and IDI-C cells grown in either Se-depleted or supplemented medium but levels of selenoprotein H mRNA were significantly lower in IDI-C cells compared with IDI-T whether the cells were grown in either Se-depleted or supplemented medium (Fig. 3).\n\nSince selenoprotein expression appeared different in IDI-C and IDI-T cells depending on the Se supply, experiments were carried out to assess how the Se content of the medium affected cell viability following challenge with tert-butylhydroperoxide. In these experiments, where cells were grown under serum-free conditions to deplete Se, cells were more sensitive to the oxidant and so 0.5 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide was used as the challenge. As shown in Fig. 4 in Se-depleted medium IDI-C cells were less viable than the IDI-T cells and this was also the case when a very low concentration of Se (1 nM) was added to the medium. As the Se concentration was increased further there was no difference in viability at 5 nM Se and then at higher concentrations of Se (10–40 nM) the difference in viability was reversed and IDI-C cells showed greater viability than IDI-T after the tert-butylhydroperoxide challenge. These data suggest that when Se supply is low IDI-C cells are under greater oxidative stress than IDI-T cells after a challenge with tert-butylhydroperoxide but that this is not the case when cells are grown in Se supplemented medium when IDI-C cells show greater viability.\n\nFinally, to exclude the possibility that the observed differences in ROS and selenoprotein expression could have been due to differences in levels of expression of the transgene, effects on single clones were compared. First, ROS levels were measured in IDI-T and IDI-C clones expressing comparable mean IDI transcript levels (0.37 and 0.30, as arbitrary units relative to GAPDH) and exposed to 100 μM tert-butylhydroperoxide. As shown in Fig. 5, mean ROS levels showed a greater increase in the IDI-C clone (2.4-fold) than in IDI-T clones (1.4 fold) and the difference between clone T5 and C4 was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In contrast two IDI-T clones showing a 2-fold difference in IDI expression (0.37 and 0.64, as arbitrary units relative to GAPDH) showed no statistically significant difference in response to tert-butylhydroperoxide. Second, the two IDI-T clones showing differences in IDI expression showed no significant difference in GPx activity whereas the IDI-T and IDI-C clones expressing similar levels of the transgene showed marked difference in mean GPx activity, with the difference between clone C4 and T1 being statistically significant (p = 0.023). These data support those in Figs. 1–3 in indicating that expression of IDI-C has a greater impact on endogenous GPx activity and ROS levels in response to an oxidative challenge."

None of the mutations was detected in 200 to 400 alleles of unrelated control subjects. All mutated residues are conserved in dog, mouse, rat, and chicken. Four residues (Met202, Trp421, Thr553, and Ala557) are also conserved in Drosophila and C. elegans.\n\np.Val136Met was observed in three patients (2, 6, and 9) and p.Ala557Thr in five (3, 5, 8, 9, and 10). Patient 8 is homozygous for p.Ala557Thr. Patient 5 showed apparent homozygosity for p.Ala557Thr but the mutation was transmitted by the unaffected mother and not carried by the father (see Supp. Figure S1). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed the patient, her father and one brother are hemizygous for CHAT. One unaffected sibling inherited the wild-type allele from both parents; the other unaffected sibling inherited only the maternal wild-type allele (see Supp. Figure S2). p.Ala557Thr also determines the phenotype in patient 10 who carries a nonsense mutation on her second allele. Patient 11, born to consanguineous parents, is homozygous for p.Ile689Ser.\n\nExpression, Kinetic Properties, and Thermal Stability of Wild-Type and Mutant ChATs\n\nTo examine the expression of the missense mutants at the protein level, we genetically engineered mutant and wild-type CHAT cDNAs into Bosc 23 cells and analyzed immunoblots of cell lysates. The spinal cord (S-type) ChAT transcript has two alternative start sites that yield 70 kDa and 74 kDa proteins at a constant ratio. Eight mutants expressed at significantly lower levels than wild-type, and five of these (p.Trp421Ser, p.Ser498Pro, p.Thr553Asn, p.Ala557Thr, p.Ser572Trp) expressed at <50% of wild-type (Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2).\n\nTo evaluate the kinetic parameters and thermal stability of wild-type and mutant ChATs, we transformed E. coli with histidine-tagged CHAT cDNAs and purified the enzymes recovered from the bacterial cell lysates on a Ni-NTA column followed by fast protein liquid chromatography. Ten mutations alter one or more rate constants of ChAT activation and two mutations compromise the thermal stability of the mutant protein (Tables 1 and 2). The Discussion analyzes the effects of each mutation and interprets them in the context of the atomic structural model of ChAT."

In total, we observed 66 CpGs for which levels of methylation were associated with one or more oxidative markers at a-per-trait FDR of <0.05; 18 of these were also associated with at least one oxidative marker at a Bonferroni-corrected alpha threshold <0.05 (taking the number of CpGs into account; ﻿Additional file 2: Figure S2). Figure 1 shows the associations of CpGs with oxidative stress markers. \n\nGlutathione\n\nGlutathione is an important antioxidant and the balance between the reduced and oxidised form is indicative of the oxidative state of an individual. We investigated the association between genome-wide methylation patterns and TGSH, GSH and GSSG and found 18, 25 and one significant CpGs, respectively (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S1–S3). As should be expected, a large proportion of CpGs associated with TGSH and GSH was shared (14 CpGs; Fig. 1), including sites annotated to BCL2L11 (cg07547695; BCL2-like 11 [apoptosis facilitator]), NDUFS7 (cg19054833; NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] Fe-S protein 7, 20 kDa) and EIF3J (cg08637583; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit J). The ratio of GSSG to GSH can be used as a marker of oxidative stress. We found methylation at 21 CpGs to be significantly associated with GSSG/GSH ratio (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S4). Methylation in the promoter region of ZNF761 (cg02892660; zinc finger protein 761) and PSMG3 (cg23970891; proteasome assembly chaperone 3), showed the strongest associations with GSSG/GSH ratio.\n\nHomocysteine\n\nIn our analysis, methylation at nine CpGs were significantly associated with levels of the amino acid HCY (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S5), including sites annotated to genes with a role in signal transduction (ENTHD1 [cg00044729], LRIG1[cg25230917], RIPK3 [cg13796295], RPS6KC1 [cg10578681], ATP2B4 [cg17850539]) and lipid-related processes (RPS6KC1 [cg10578681]).\n\nLipid-related oxidative markers\n\nIn genome-wide methylation analysis, oxLDL was associated with methylation in the 5'-UTR of SEMA6A (cg06650664; sema domain, transmembrane domain [TM], and cytoplasmic domain, [semaphorin] 6A), a protein with anti-angiogenic function (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S6). Oxidation of LDL can also be monitored by markers CD and BCD-LDL which measure products of lipid peroxidation. In our analysis, CD was found to associate with higher methylation at a CpG site located in the 3'-UTR of TAPBP (cg09899712; TAP binding protein [tapasin]) and the promoter region (TSS1500) of RGL2 (cg09899712; ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator-like 2 (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S7). Methylation levels at six CpGs were associated with BCD-LDL (FDR < 0.05; Additional file 3: Table S8). These were annotated to CKAP5 (cg09822824; cytoskeleton associated protein 5), FOSL2 (cg11133114; FOS-like antigen 2), FAM20C (cg21913519, cg05969038; family with sequence similarity 20, member C) and FRMD6 (cg18894781; FERM Domain containing 6). We observed no overlap in significant CpGs between the three lipid-related oxidative markers. As CD (p-value = 0.00011) and BCD-LDL (p-value = 0.0091) were found to be associated with BMI in sex-adjusted models in our study, secondary models adjusted for BMI were also performed for these two phenotypes (Additional file 3: Tables S7–S8). None of the phenotype-associated CpGs showed a large change in the regression coefficient for the oxidative marker after adjustment with BMI, indicating that BMI did not confound the relationship between DNA methylation and these oxidative markers (Additional file 1: Figure S3).\n\nFunctional characterisation of methylation sites associated with oxidative stress\n\nWe explored the functional role of CpGs associated with oxidative markers through investigation of their genomic location with respect to genes, CpG islands and functional regulatory elements. Phenotype-associated CpGs were enriched in CpG island shores compared to all CpGs on the array (enrichment p-value = 0.04, Fig. 2). A larger proportion of phenotype-associated CpGs (as compared to all CpGs) were located in promoters of genes (45% vs. 36%; enrichment p-value = 0.06, Fig. 3); thus having the potential to affect transcription from adjacent genes. We assessed the overlap of associated CpGs with functional regulatory elements across cell types using RegulomeDB. Twenty-three percentages of sites showed strong evidence of being located in a functional regulatory region (RegulomeDB score 1a-2c; Additional file 3: Tables S1–S8). This was more than expected by chance (permutation p-value = 0.01).  \n\nTo assess whether genes annotated to phenotype-associated CpGs are likely to be regulated by a common set of TFs, we used PSCAN with the JASPAR database. We found significant enrichment of four TF binding sites (adjusted p-value <0.05; Additional file 1: Table S9), including binding sites of E2F1, a gene/protein with a potential role in atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\nTo further place our findings in biological context, we performed gene set enrichment analysis on the 64 genes annotated to CpGs associated with oxidative markers. Using the Functional Annotation Clustering Tool in DAVID, we found evidence of genes clustering into annotations (enrichment score > 1) relating to functional terms phosphorylation and phosphate/phosphorous metabolic processes and pleckstrin domains (Additional file 1: Table S11).\n\nGenetic associations of oxidative stress-associated DNA methylation\n\nGenetic sequence variants have been shown to contribute to DNA methylation variation, so called meQTLs. We examined the presence of such loci for the 66 CpGs associated with oxidative markers, and found 28 (41.8%) of phenotype-CpGs with a significant cis-meQTL (FDR < 0.05, nominal p-value <2.07E-4, Additional file 1: Table S12). To assess whether genetic associations with markers of oxidative stress may be mediated by epigenetics, we examined whether genotype-phenotype, genotype-CpG and CpG-phenotype associations overlapped (an overview of the analysis are available in Additional file 4: Figure S4). Overall, we investigated whether cis-meQTL SNPs associated with the oxidative markers and found modest suggestive evidence of association (p-value <0.001) for 171 SNPs (0.56%) with at least one of the oxidative markers. We found two instances (at cg07547695 in the 5'-UTR of BCL2L11, associated with both TGSH and GSH) for which associations of genotype-phenotype (p-value <0.001), cis-meQTL (FDR < 0.05) and CpG-phenotype (FDR < 0.05) overlapped (Additional file 1: Table S13; Additional file 4: Figure S4). A proxy of rs6750142 (rs726430, r 2 = 1) associated with methylation at cg07547695 was nominally associated (p-value <0.05) with both CHD and T2D in GWAS.\n\nWe investigated the behaviour of 1599 significant meQTL SNPs (FDR < 0.05) in GWAS data from the CARDIoGRAM consortium for CHD and the DIAGRAM consortium for T2D. We found no evidence of overrepresentation of nominally significant associations (p-value <0.05) for CHD (one-sided Fisher exact p-value = 0.99) or T2D (one-sided Fisher exact p-value = 0.93) among significant meQTL SNPs. One or more significant meQTL SNPs of nine CpG sites were nominally associated with CHD in GWAS data from the CARDIoGRAM consortium (p-value < 0.05). These were annotated to AMDHD1 (cg15351688: rs10777751, rs7955450, rs7486703), BCL2L11 (cg07547695: rs726430), FAM20C (cg05969038: rs7786461; cg21913519: rs7786461), HSP90AB1 (cg26241416: rs6905285, rs7758726, rs666462), SEMA6A (cg06650664: rs10077506, rs17139825), WNK2 (cg14396800: rs2991377,rs10992689, rs10821105) and intergenic sites on chr. 5 (cg15609272: rs17057846) and chr. 12 (cg17173663: rs1354156) (Additional file 5). In analogous analysis on GWAS data from the DIAGRAM consortium, we found nominal associations for SNPs associated with methylation at CpG sites annotated to BCL2L11 (cg07547695: rs726430), CEP55 (cg24371383: rs12782691), CPB1 (cg04072156: rs16861015) and an intergenic site on chr. 4 (cg14532755: rs1665364, rs2236786, rs3752749, rs732754, rs744658, rs798719, rs798726, rs798727, rs798741, rs798744, rs798751, rs798754, rs798755, rs798756, rs798766, rs811316, rs8389) (p-value < 0.05; Additional file 5).\n\nThe relationship between oxidative stress-associated CpGs and disease incidence\n\nAs markers of oxidative stress have been associated with both CVD and T2D, we sought to assess the role of epigenetics in this process. Methylation levels at the 66 CpGs associated with oxidative markers were tested for association with incident CVD (n = 180) and T2D (n = 71) events during a 10-year follow-up using logistic regression models to examine their potential role in disease. Epigenetic variation in the 3'-UTR of HIST1H4D (cg08170869; histone cluster 1, H4d) and in the body of DVL1 (cg03465880; dishevelled-1) were associated with incident T2D (permutation p-value <0.01; Table 2). For every SD decrease in methylation β value at cg08170869, the risk of T2D was 39% higher (nominal p-value = 0.0034; permutation p-value = 0.0044; odds ratio [OR] per SD decrement = 1.39 [95% CI, 1.15–1.57]). Similarly, hypomethylation in DVL1 was associated with higher risk of T2D (nominal p-value = 0.0073; permutation p-value = 0.0080; OR per SD decrement = 1.31 [95% CI, 1.10–1.47]). \n\nAnalogous analysis of CVD revealed no significant association of methylation levels at the phenotype-associated CpGs with incident CVD events (permutation p-value <0.01). The strongest association was to methylation levels at cg11842944 in the body of ZNF341 (nominal p-value = 0.013; permutation p-value = 0.016; OR per SD decrement = 1.23 [95% CI, 1.05–1.42]). Analysing myocardial infarction (n = 55), heart failure (n = 76) and ischaemic stroke (n = 47) separately, methylation at this CpG showed the strongest association to heart failure (nominal p-value = 0.0087; permutation p-value = 0.0126; OR per SD decrement = 1.28 [95% CI, 1.06–1.50]). This gene lies in a region previously associated with height in GWAS and encodes a gene product involved in transcriptional regulation."

    "content": "3. Results\n\nExome enrichment and sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 was performed on CMH000067 and her two healthy parents (CMH000068 & CMH000069). The exome sequencing of CMH000067 generated a total of 7.7 gigabases of sequence resulting in a mean nuclear exome coverage of 59.6× and 86.0% of exome targets were covered at 16× or greater (Table 1), a suitable value for accurate heterozygous variant genotyping. Sequencing reads were aligned using GSNAP and only unambiguous, uniquely aligned reads which aligned best to a single location in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome were evaluated for variant calls. Despite nuclear exome enrichment, the mitochondrial genome remained present and was sequenced concomitantly to an average depth of 25.5× resulting in 99.06% covered at 10× or greater (Table 1). The parental exomes were sequenced to >6 gigabases and had 88.05% and 88.52% of nuclear exome targets and 81.6% and 95.69% mtDNA covered at 10× or greater respectively (Table 1). A total of 105,487 variants including 10 mtDNA variants were discovered in CMH000069. Analysis revealed an apparently homoplasmic de novo mutation in mtDNA 8993T>G (c.467T>G, p.Leu156Arg) in the ATP synthase 6 gene (MT-ATP6, OMIM #516060; Fig. 2A). The variant was seen in 21 of 21 sequencing reads covering the base. This is a known disease causing variant responsible for 10–20% of Leigh syndrome (OMIM #256000) cases due to deficient activity of complex V (ATP synthase) in the electron transport chain, however previous clinical sequencing of mtDNA in this patient did not include MT-ATP6. A clinically validated restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay as well as capillary sequencing was used to confirm these findings on DNA from both blood and urine from the child (Fig. 2B). The 8993T>G mutation was not seen in maternal DNA from blood by next-generation exome sequencing, but coverage (15×) was likely insufficient for the detection of low levels of heteroplasmy. Although the 8993 mutation is usually well-represented in blood, we tested DNA isolated from both maternal urine and blood using capillary sequencing and PCR/RFLP analysis. Although the mutation was undetectable, these methods may fail to detect heteroplasmy of less than 10%. Consequently, as most cases of Leigh syndrome due to the 8993 mutation are maternally inherited, we cannot rule out that the mother may have a low level of heteroplasmy.\n\nExome sequencing was conducted on the proband (CMH000254), her deceased sibling (CMH000255), and both parents. All samples were sequenced to a depth of at least 8 gigabases resulting in greater than 87% of the targeted regions receiving 10× or greater coverage (Table 1). Less than 4% of the exome received 0× coverage. A total of ~3500 variants for each sample were characterized as category 1–3 by RUNES (Supplement Table 2,). Briefly, category 1 variants are those previously described as disease causing, category 2 are those variants of the type likely to disrupt protein function and be disease causing if they are in a gene associated with disease and category 3 are variants of unknown significance that may or may not cause disease. Filtering variants to exclude those present at an allele frequency of > 1% in the Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine internal database, which includes all variants ever detected from samples sequenced at the center and the corresponding frequency, resulted in nearly an 8-fold reduction in the number of variants (Table 2). Using a recessive inheritance model, variants were filtered to only include homozygous variants or genes in which there were two or more variants inherited on different alleles. Further filtering of variants was accomplished by limiting variants to those that were shared by both affected siblings and resulted in a total number of 29 variants to investigate in 18 genes (Table 3). Of the 18 genes only six were associated with disease in OMIM, with NDUFV1 being the only gene associated with metabolism. Both infants were found to be compound heterozygotes for two missense variants in the NDUFV1 gene c.736G>A, p.Glu246Lys (Fig. 3A) and c.349G>A, p.Ala117Thr (Fig. 3B). The parents each carry one variant, confirming they are present on opposite alleles. While neither variant has been previously reported, both affect highly conserved codons and are predicted to be damaging by in silico analysis. Furthermore, the Ala117Thr variant has been found by clinical testing in addition to a second novel missense mutation in a patient with confirmed mitochondrial disease (personal communication—Renkui Bai). This genotype was interpreted as being likely pathogenic and confirmed clinically by capillary sequencing (Figs. 3A & B). NDUFV1 encodes a 464 amino acid long protein that functions to release electrons from NADH via complex 1 of the electron transport chain, with resultant movement of the electrons to ubiquinone. The protein contains NADH, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and iron–sulfur cluster binding sites that are predicted to be necessary for proper functioning of complex I. The Glu246Lys mutation occurs in the FMN binding site and could potentially be involved in binding of NADH.\n\nDNA isolated from peripheral blood cells from CMH000036 was enriched for the nuclear exome and sequenced to 8.7 gigabases, producing mean target nuclear exome coverage of 71.9× and mtDNA coverage of 30.1× (Table 1). A total of 150,740 nuclear and 32 mtDNA variants were found. Of these variants 3242 were classified as category 1–3 by RUNES (Table 2). Applying a variant filter of less than 1% frequency in our internal database reduced the number of variants to 790. Due to lack of parental samples all genes with homozygous variants and genes with two or more variants were considered to be consistent with a recessive inheritance pattern, which limited the total variants to 141 in 67 genes. Of these variants, three were categorized 1 (Table 3) as previously reported disease causing mutations including c.437G>A (Ser146Asn) in coenzyme Q2 homolog, prenyltransferase (COQ2). The c.437G>A mutation was seen in 41 of 63 reads covering the position (Fig. 4A). Mutations in COQ2 have been reported to cause coenzyme Q10 deficiency (OMIM #609825). Further analysis of variants in COQ2 revealed a second variant c.1159C>T present in 14 of 30 sequencing reads (Fig. 4B), which causes an arginine to change to a premature stop codon at amino acid position 387 (Arg387X). Taken together, these variants in combination with the clinical phenotype are consistent with a diagnosis of coenzyme Q10 deficiency. In addition, we found a novel variant (3754C>A) in the mitochondrial genome-encoded NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, MT-ND1 gene (Supplement Fig. 1). This variant was found in 8 of 36 sequence reads aligned to this nucleotide in the mitochondrial genome, implying ~22% heteroplasmy in peripheral blood. The variant was not found in more than 1400 other samples sequenced at CMH and was not reported in MitoMap, suggesting it to be a novel variant. Unfortunately, a sample from the mother could not be obtained. Subunit 1 is one of seven mtDNA encoded subunits included among the approximately 41 polypeptides of respiratory complex I. Mutations in MT-ND1 cause a wide range of disorders, including Leber optic atrophy (OMIM #535000), mitochondrial complex I deficiency (OMIM #252010) and MELAS (OMIM #540000). Subsequent capillary sequencing of DNA isolated from the blood, lung, and heart confirmed the 3754C>A mutation and was estimated to be ~25% heteroplasmic on the basis of relative dideoxynucleotide peaks (Supplement Fig. 2)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nBaseline and Demographic Comparisons\n\nPre-test comparisons were conducted to determine whether the OPRM1 groups differed based on demographic and drinking variables. There were no significant OPRM1 genotype group differences across demographic variables (p’s > 0.05). Results revealed significant genotype group differences across drinking variables, specifically AUDIT score, number of drinking days, and drinks per drinking day in the past 30 days. Table 1. All subsequent analyses controlled for these variables found to differ across OPRM1 genotype. Notably, coefficients did not change in statistical significance when comparing models including AUDIT score, drinking days, or drinks per drinking day as covariates. Therefore, all models included only drinking days as the representative covariate for OPRM1 genotype group differences in drinking. To further validate the main results, all analyses controlled for ALDH2 (rs671) and ADH1B (rs1229984) markers. Analyses of subjective response during the alcohol infusion session controlled for baseline (i.e. BrAC = 0.00 g/dl) levels of subjective response on the corresponding outcome variable.\n\nA series of Fisher’s exact tests, non-parametric tests accounting for small cell sizes, were conducted to examine 24 possible side effects from the medication as indicated by the SAFTEE checklist. Results revealed a significant association between medication and drowsiness, which occurred in 20% of participants while on naltrexone in comparison to 7% while on placebo (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.05). There was also a significant medication association on ringing in the ears, which occurred in 3% of participants when taking naltrexone in comparison to 1% while taking placebo (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.03). There were no significant medication associations on the remaining 22 side effects measured by the SAFTEE (Fisher’s exact test, p > 0.05), including nausea. There were also no significant differences in side effects as a function of OPRM1 genotype (Fisher’s exact test, p > 0.05).\n\nPharmacogenetic Effects: Alcohol Craving\n\nAnalyses of alcohol-induced craving revealed no simple effect of genotype (b = 0.20, SE = 0.21, t = 0.96, p = 0.34), medication (b = −0.15, SE = 0.17, t = −0.86, p = 0.39), or medication × genotype interaction (b = 0.15, SE = 0.21, t = 0.73, p = 0.47). There was not a significant medication × genotype × BrAC interaction (b = −0.20, SE = 0.13, t = −1.52, p = 0.13). As expected, there was an effect of BrAC (b = 0.13, SE = 0.06, t = 2.10, p = 0.04), such that participants reported higher levels of alcohol craving across rising BrAC levels. Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = 0.02) and baseline AUQ values (p < 0.01). Current cigarette smoking status, defined using a binary variable (i.e., 0 = non-smoker and 1 = smoker), was not a significant moderator of any of these effects (p ≥ 0.28).\n\nPharmacogenetic Effects: Subjective Response to Alcohol\n\nAnalyses of alcohol-induced sedation revealed no simple effect of genotype (b = −0.11, SE = 0.37, t = −0.30, p = 0.77), medication (b = 0.14, SE = 0.23, t = 0.61, p = 0.55), or medication × genotype interaction (b = −0.21, SE = 0.29, t = −0.72, p = 0.47). There was not a significant three-way interaction across medication × genotype × BrAC (b = 0.28, SE = 0.21, t = 1.30, p = 0.19). There was an effect of BrAC (b = 0.30, SE = 0.15, t = 2.02, p = 0.04) with participants reporting greater sedation across rising BrAC levels. Significant covariates included ADH1B genotype (p = 0.01) and baseline sedation values (p < 0.01). Nicotine smoking status was not a significant moderator of any of these effects (p ≥ 0.11).\n\nAnalyses of alcohol-induced stimulation revealed no simple effect of medication (b = 0.16, SE = 0.13, t = 1.20, p = 0.23), genotype (b = 0.37, SE = 0.22, t = 1.69, p = 0.09), or medication × genotype (b = 0.04, SE = 0.21, t = 0.20, p = 0.84). There was however a significant three-way interaction across medication × genotype × BrAC (b = −0.32, SE = 0.16, t = −1.93, p = 0.05); see Figure 3. Follow-up post-hoc analyses examined the effect of BrAC in each of the four medication × genotype groups. These post-hoc tests revealed significant positive effects of BrAC effects in all groups (p’s < 0.01), with the exception of the Asn40 homozygotes + placebo group (p = 0.10). Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = 0.03) and baseline stimulation values (p < 0.01). Nicotine smoking status was not a significant moderator of any of these effects (p ≥ 0.14).\n\nPharmacogenetic Effects: Alcohol Self-Administration\n\nPoisson regression analyses for total number of drinks consumed revealed no significant main effect of medication (F (1,71) = 2.24, p = 0.14, naltrexone mean = 0.93, SD = 1.35 versus placebo mean = 1.19, SD = 1.43). There was a significant main effect of genotype (F (1,71) = 5.79, p = 0.02) such that Asp40 carriers consumed significantly fewer drinks (mean = 0.80, SD = 1.27) in comparison to Asn40 homozygotes (mean = 1.51, SD = 1.49). There was no significant medication × genotype interaction (F (1,70) = 0.68, p = 0.41). Significant covariates included ALDH2 genotype (p = .05). Smoking status was trending towards predicting greater self-administration (F(1,68)=3.87, p = 0.053), such that non-smokers consumed 0.83 (SD = 1.27) drinks versus 1.41 (SD = 1.50) for smokers. Smoking status did not moderate or affect any medication or genotype effects (p ≥ 0.25).\n\nThe distribution of latency to first drink was non-normal. Collapsed across medication conditions and genotype groups, 29% consumed their first drink immediately (within the first three minutes), 18% consumed their first drink at some point during the session (but not immediately), and 53% abstained during the entire session. Cox proportional regression models revealed no significant main effect of medication on latency to first drink (Wald χ2 = 2.58, p = 0.10, HR = .67); however, there was a significant main effect of genotype on latency to first drink (Wald χ2 = 3.39, p = 0.03, HR = 1.89) such that Asn40 homozygotes had a significantly shorter latency to first drink, Figure 4. When medication × genotype interaction was added to the models (Figure 5), the effect of genotype was no longer significant (p = 0.12) nor was the medication × genotype interaction (p = 0.63). There were no significant covariates across either model (p’s > 0.09). Smoking status was associated with marginally shorter latency to drink (Wald χ2 = 2.61, p = 0.07) but did not moderate the effects of genotype or medication (p ≥ 0.40).\n\nTreating OPRM1 genotype as a three-level variable did not significantly alter the pharmacogenetic results reported above."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\n Table 2 presents the baseline characteristics of the study population according to the ALDH2 rs671 genotypes in each sex. The mean daily drinks in men were 1.95, 0.39, and 0.12 for the GG, GA, and AA genotypes, respectively, and 0.14, 0.03, and < 0.01 in women. In both sexes, GG genotypes had the highest daily alcohol consumption. However, the difference of drinks per day between GG genotype and GA genotype was higher than between GA genotype and AA genotype. The pattern of cortisol levels according to genotypes varied by sex. The GA group had the lowest levels in men, and the AA group had the lowest levels in women, but the difference between groups was not significant in women. The difference of distribution of age between the genotypes are significant and the GA genotype group were older than other genotypes in both sexes. And BMI differed according to the rs671 polymorphism significantly in men.\n\nTable 3 presents the results of the univariate and multivariate linear regression models in each sex. Daily alcohol consumption was positively associated with blood cortisol levels in the univariate model in both sexes. After adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and education status, the strength of the association between daily alcohol consumption and blood cortisol level was similar to the results of the univariate analysis in men but was higher in women.\n\nTable 4 shows the association between the genetically predicted alcohol consumption and blood cortisol level in each sex. The MR results except for ex-drinkers, are presented as a sensitivity analysis. In men, all models showed a positive association of genetically predicted daily alcohol consumption and blood cortisol level. In the MR analysis, the genetically predicted one standard drink/day increases cortisol by 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21–0.51). In sensitivity analysis genetically predicted one standard drink/day elevates cortisol by 0.27 (95% CI, 0.14–0.41). However, there was no significant association between alcohol and cortisol in all models for women."

The average age of the participants was 76.64 ± 6.40 years (range, 65–94 years) and all were from an elderly Beijing community-dwelling population. The prevalence of HUA was 14.71% in the study population, with 151 HUA cases and 1055 controls. Table 1 indicates that individuals in the HUA group had higher levels of serum creatinine, TG, LDL, and BMI, but lower levels of HDL, compared to controls (p < 0.05). The percentage of hypertensive patients in the HUA cases was also higher compared to the control group (47.7% vs 38.8%, p = 0.041), but there was no significant difference in SBP and DBP between the two groups, which may be related to hypertension treatment (e.g., 31.8% of the HUA cases and 18.8% of the controls, p = 4.9 × 10− 5). However, the ratio of diuretics was relatively low and did not reach statistical significance between the two groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference in FBG, alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, or history of diabetes between the case and control groups. \n\nDistribution of ABCG2, SLC2A9, and SLC22A12 polymorphisms between two groups\n\nThe three tested SNPs (SLC2A9 rs3733591, ABCG2 rs2231142, and SLC22A12 rs893006) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.30, 0.70, and 0.33, respectively). The genotype and allele frequencies of these three SNPs are shown in Table 2 and stratified by gender. In the general population, the genotype frequencies of ABCG2 rs2231142 among HUA cases were 11.9% (T/T), 53.6% (T/G), and 34.4% (G/G), respectively, while the genotype frequencies were 8.0% (T/T), 40.4% (T/G), and 51.7% (G/G) in the controls, respectively. The minor T allele of the ABCG2 variants reached 28.2% in the controls and 38.7% in the HUA cases. The distribution of ABCG2 variants showed statistical significance in males and when combining males and females for the Chi-square test, there was no significant association in females (p = 0.053). The distribution of SLC2A9 rs3733591 was only significantly different in females (p = 0.003), with a frequency of 17.8% for C/C and 52.1% for C/T in the HUA cases. There was no significant difference in genotype frequency of SLC22A12 rs893006 between HUA cases and controls in both males and females. \n\nAssociation between risk alleles of uric acid genes with sUA levels and HUA risk\n\nIn all samples, there was a significant association of increased sUA levels (μmol/L) with each copy of risk allele of the three SNPs (Beta = 0.08, p = 0.002 in rs3733591 SLC2A9, Beta = 0.16, p = 6.75 × 10− 9 in rs2231142 ABCG2, Beta = 0.07, p = 0.006 in rs893006 SLC22A12; Table 3). There was also a significant association HUA with the risk alleles of these three SNPs [OR (95% CI): 1.34 (1.03–1.74), p = 0.029 in rs3733591 SLC2A9, OR (95% CI): 1.63 (1.27–2.11), p = 1.65 × 10− 4 in rs2231142 ABCG2]; however, there was no significant association of HUA with SLC22A12 rs893006 variants [OR (95% CI): 1.33 (0.99–1.78), p = 0.061]. After we separated the subjects by gender, the T allele of rs2231142 ABCG2 was associated with sUA level and HUA in both males and females (all p < 0.05), but the C risk allele in rs3722591 SLC2A9 was only associated with sUA level and HUA in females. The SLC22A12 rs893006 G risk allele was only associated with sUA level in males. \n\nAssociation between different genotypes of three SNPs and sUA level\n\nsUA level (μmol/L) was associated with the ABCG2 rs2231142 polymorphism in all populations (T/T: 337.46 ± 71.25, T/G: 317.51 ± 80.53, G/G: 287.46 ± 75.13; p = 6.98 × 10− 8) and sUA levels of the G/G genotypes were significantly lower compared with those of the T/T genotypes (p = 4.40 × 10− 6). There was also a significant difference in sUA levels in the G/G and T/T male carriers (G/G vs. T/T: 313.32 ± 73.83 vs 348.20 ± 68.85; p = 0.003) and female carriers (G/G vs T/T: 276.18 ± 71.65 vs 323.32 ± 72.67; p = 2.67 × 10− 4). The sUA level was higher in SLC2A9 C/C carriers of the whole population and females compared with T/T carriers (p = 0.005 and 0.015, respectively), but there was no association in male subjects. There was also no significant difference in sUA levels between each genotype of the SLC22A12 rs893006 polymorphism analyzed using the posthoc Bonferroni test (Table 4). \n\nAssociation of sUA levels and genetic risk scores\n\nThe genetic risk score of an individual was generated by counting the number of risk alleles of high sUA levels in the study population, ranging from 0 to 6 (C allele of SLC2A9 rs3733951, T allele of ABCG2 rs2231142, and G allele of SLC22A12 rs893006; Fig. 1). Using linear regression analysis, we found that the mean sUA level in both males and females significantly increased with the number of risk alleles (Beta = 0.17, p = 6.24 × 10− 7 in males and Beta = 0.20, p = 7.39 × 10− 7, respectively). In the whole population, the mean sUA level also increased linearly with the number of risk alleles (Beta = 0.18, p = 1.94 × 10− 12). \n\nAssociation between rs2231142 ABCG2 variants and HUA risk according to cardiovascular risk factors\n\nTable 5 summarizes the association between ABCG2 rs2231142 polymorphisms and HUA risk with or without cardiovascular risk factors. In all study populations, the OR of HUA with each copy of the T allele in rs2231142 increased significantly when accounting for cardiovascular risks (such as obesity, hypertension, higher levels of TG and LDL, and lower levels of HDL) compared to those without cardiovascular risk factors. The OR of HUA with high TG levels and low HDL levels had a strong increase in HUA risk associated with each copy of T alleles in 2,231,142 in males (OR (95% CI): 2.41 (1.06–4.53), p = 0.035 and OR (95% CI): 2.50 (1.12–5.67), p = 0.026, respectively). Among females, the association was statistically significant in individuals with obesity [OR (95% CI): 1.59 (1.04–3.04); p = 0.045], hypertension [OR (95% CI): 1.83 (1.09–3.08); p = 0.021], and high TG levels [OR (95% CI): 2.57 (1.10–6.01); p = 0.030] and LDL levels [OR (95% CI): 1.98 (1.20–3.34); p = 0.008] compared with those with non-cardiovascular risk factors, but not those with low HDL levels (p = 0.156). \n\nWe further assessed the association between cardiovascular risk factors and HUA risk or sUA levels among the ABCG2 rs2231142 T allele carriers (Table 6). BMI and TG levels were associated with higher sUA levels (Beta = 0.21, p = 3.40 × 10− 8 and Beta = 0.24, p = 6.18 × 10− 9, respectively) in the whole population, and this association was also significant in males (Beta = 0.23, p = 1.14 × 10− 5 for BMI and Beta = 0.25, p = 8.95 × 1 0− 6 for TG level, respectively) and females (Beta = 0.20, p = 0.002 for BMI and Beta = 0.24, p = 4.00 × 10− 4 for TG level, respectively). The association of BMI and TG level with HUA risk was also significant in males [OR (95% CI) = 2.01 (1.62–2.50); p = 1.75 × 10− 10 and OR (95% CI) = 1.88 (1.28–2.74); p = 0.001, respectively] and females [OR (95% CI): 1.22 (1.08–1.37); p = 0.001and OR (95% CI): 1.95 (1.26–2.55); p = 0.003, respectively]. However, other cardiovascular risk factors were not associated with sUA level and HUA risk among rs2231142 T allele carriers."

    "content": "Results\n\nIdentification of Loci Associated with Kidney Function across Ancestry Groups\n\nWe identified 20 loci attaining genome-wide-significant evidence of association with eGFR (p < 5 × 10−8) in trans-ethnic meta-analysis (Table 1, Figure S2). These loci have been previously reported in ethnic-specific GWASs of individuals with European and East Asian ancestry (Table S4). They include two loci discovered in a recently published meta-analysis of European ancestry GWASs: LRP2 ([MIM: 600073] rs57989581, p = 5.6 × 10−10) and NFATC1 ([MIM: 600489] rs8096658, p = 1.3 × 10−8). Previously reported lead SNPs at an additional 21 established kidney-function loci attained nominal evidence of association (p < 0.05) with eGFR, with consistent direction of effect (Table S4).\n\nAs expected, lead SNPs were common across ancestry groups at all 20 loci, with each displaying modest effects on eGFR (Table S5). Despite substantial variability in allele frequencies between ancestry groups, we observed no evidence of trans-ethnic heterogeneity in allelic effects on eGFR for any lead SNP (Table 1, Table S5). Through conditional analyses (Table S6), we observed no evidence of multiple distinct signals of association for eGFR at any locus (pCOND < 10−5, Bonferroni correction for ∼5,000 variants per locus). Taken together, these data are consistent with a single variant driving association signals in each locus; each variant is shared across ancestry groups and has homogeneous effects on eGFR in diverse populations. However, we recognize that larger multi-ethnic samples will be required to detect lower frequency, population-specific distinct association signals of modest effect on kidney function.\n\nImpact of Lead eGFR SNPs on CKD and Kidney Function in Diabetic Individuals\n\nWe assessed the impact on CKD of lead SNPs at the 20 eGFR loci in a subset of individuals (up to 3,976 cases and 55,904 controls) contributing to our trans-ethnic meta-analysis (Table S7). We defined CKD by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or incidence of ESRD. For all 20 lead SNPs, the eGFR-decreasing allele was associated with increased risk of CKD. Eleven of the lead SNPs demonstrated evidence of association with CKD at nominal significance (p < 0.05), and the strongest signals were observed at UNCX (rs62435145, p = 2.2 × 10−7), ALMS1 ([MIM: 606844] rs7587577, p = 3.1 × 10−6), and PDILT-UMOD ([MIM: 191845] rs77924615, p = 4.0 × 10−6).\n\nWe also investigated the impact of the lead SNPs on eGFR in GWASs of individuals with diabetes for whom there are different mechanisms for loss of renal function, such as diabetic nephropathy. We obtained association summary statistics for eGFR in 13,158 subjects of European ancestry with diabetes (9,197 with T2D and 3,961 with T1D) from the SUMMIT Consortium (Table S8). Consistent with previous reports, allelic effects on eGFR in diabetic individuals and our trans-ethnic meta-analysis of individuals from the general population were homogeneous (Figure S3). There was nominal evidence of association with eGFR (p < 0.05), with the same direction of effect, at seven loci, and the strongest signals were observed at PDILT-UMOD (p = 6.9 × 10−6), PRKAG2 ([MIM: 602743] p = 0.00013) and NFATC1 (p = 0.00045).\n\nFine Mapping of eGFR Loci\n\nWe next sought to localize variants driving eGFR association signals in each of the 20 loci attaining genome-wide significance in our trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We utilized trans-ethnic fine mapping implemented in MANTRA, taking advantage of increased sample size and the expectation that patterns of LD vary between diverse populations. We derived credible sets of variants mapping within 500 kb of the lead SNP at each locus that together account for 99% of the posterior probability (πC) of driving the association signal (Table S9). Smaller credible sets, in terms of the number of SNPs they contain, or the genomic interval that they cover, thus correspond to more precise fine-mapping. The 99% credible set at the PDILT-UMOD locus included a single variant (rs77924615, πC>0.999), which maps to an intron of PDILT. This variant has previously been reported as driving the primary association signal for CKD at the PDILT-UMOD locus through whole-genome sequencing and long-range haplotype imputation into 194,286 Icelandic individuals with serum creatinine measurements. We also observed precise localization, defined by a 99% credible set including no more than five variants (Table S10), at a five additional loci: NFATC1 (two variants, mapping to 0.4 kb), SLC34A1 ([MIM: 182309] two variants, mapping to 0.6 kb), GCKR ([MIM: 600842] three variants, mapping to 11.7 kb), DCDC5-MPPED2 ([MIM: 612321, 600911] four variants, mapping to 27.9 kb), and PIP5K1B ([MIM: 602745] five variants, mapping to 3.5 kb).\n\nIntegration of Genetic Fine-mapping and Genomic Annotation\n\nTo gain insight into the mechanisms through which association signals at the 20 GWAS loci attaining genome-wide significance in our trans-ethnic meta-analysis impact eGFR, we began by obtaining genomic annotations for all single-nucleotide variants mapping within 500 kb of lead SNPs. Across all 20 loci, only 5.4% of the posterior probability of driving association signals was annotated to coding variants (Table S11), the majority of which was accounted for by GCKR p.Pro446Leu (rs1260326, πC = 0.938). This missense variant has been shown, functionally, to result in increased de novo triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis and export and decreased plasma glucose concentrations, all of which have been associated with risk of CKD, making GCKR the likely effector transcript for eGFR at this locus. However, outside of the GCKR locus, variants mapping to non-coding sequence accounted for more than 99.4% of the probability of driving eGFR association, suggesting that these signals are most likely to be mediated by effects on gene regulation.\n\nWe next investigated whether genomic annotations of regulatory chromatin state for 93 cell types, DHSs for 145 cell types, and ChIP-seq binding sites for 165 transcription factors were predictive of posterior probability of driving association signals across the 20 loci (Figure 1, Table S12). We observed significant effects (p < 0.00012, Bonferroni correction for 403 annotations) on posterior probability for variants in kidney DHSs, including adult renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs; p = 3.4 × 10−8), renal cortical epithelial cells (HRCEs; p = 4.7 ×10−7), and fetal kidney cells (p = 8.8 × 10−6). We also observed significant effects on posterior probability for transcription-factor binding sites, most notably for HDAC8 (p = 1.1 × 10−14). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in kidney function and development, and HDAC inhibitors could be promising in the treatment of kidney disease. We repeated our analyses by using fGWAS (Figure S4, Table S12) and observed strong correlation in the ranking of enriched annotations (r2 = 0.93). These results highlight that variants driving association signals with eGFR are more likely to be co-localized with annotated elements in kidney cells, thereby suggesting that gene regulation in disease-relevant tissues is a likely mechanism by which GWAS loci impact CKD.\n\nLead SNPs that, by themselves, accounted for more than 80% of the posterior probability of driving association signals overlapped an enriched annotation at five loci (Table S13). In particular, at the SLC34A1 locus, rs35716097 (πC = 0.946) overlapped DHSs in RPTECs and HRCEs, as well as a binding site for HDAC8, while at the NFATC1 locus, rs8096658 (πC = 0.877) overlapped fetal kidney cell DHSs (Figure S5). At both of these loci, the lead SNPs were also expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for NFATC1 and RGS14 (MIM: 602513; at the SLC34A1 locus) in multiple tissues (Table S13), highlighting these genes as likely effector transcripts through which eGFR association signals are mediated. NFATC1 plays a central role in inducible gene transcription during immune response and is a downstream target of the transplant immunosuppression drug cyclosporine A. RGS14 encodes a member of the regulator of G protein signaling family, which modulates downstream effects of Gα subunits and has unknown function in kidneys.\n\nExperimental Data in Model Organisms\n\nTo provide insight into the role of NFATC1 and RGS14 (at the SLC34A1 locus) in kidney physiology, we examined the function of ancestral orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila genome encodes a single member of the NFAT family, and a previous report has demonstrated that flies with NFAT loss-of-function mutations have increased salt sensitivity, suggesting a role for this gene in ionic or osmotic regulation. The closest RGS14 ortholog in Drosophila melanogaster is loco, for which reduced expression is associated with longer lifespan and stress resistance. We thus conducted experiments aimed at characterizing a role for loco loss-of-function variants in salt sensitivity. We compared survival of two independently derived heterozygous loco mutants (y1w1; locod06164/+ and y1w1; locoEY-P283/+) with isogenic y1w1 controls after supplementing their diet with varying NaCl concentrations for 8 days (Figure 2). There was very little mortality of any of the genotypes on non-NaCl-supplemented food, indicating no baseline differences in viability over the time period tested. However, we observed significantly improved survival of the heterozygous loco mutants over controls on NaCl-supplemented food (Figure 2, Table S14), thereby indicating a role for this gene in resistance to salt stress. To exclude the effects of inbreeding depression on our findings, we also repeated our experiments with the same strains on a heterogenic background. As expected, the hybrid heterogenic strains were less salt susceptible than the isogenic strains, but the loco mutants remained salt-resistant when compared to controls of a similar genetic background (Figure 2, Table S14).\n\nTo further investigate the role of NFATC1 and RGS14 in kidney function, we used the 129S6 mouse strain that is salt-sensitive and susceptible to glomerulosclerosis. We compared the renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 and Rgs14 at baseline versus (1) after a 2-week exposure to high-salt diet and (2) at 12 weeks after CKD induced by sub-total nephrectomy. Compared to baseline condition, Rgs14 was significantly decreased (∼75%, p = 0.01) during high-salt exposure (Figure 3). In the CKD model, Rgs14 expression was also reduced and approached statistical significance (p = 0.06). The renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 was also significantly decreased (∼50%, p = 0.03) during high-salt exposure and trended down in CKD (p = 0.31). Although we cannot establish cause and effect, these data illustrate that the expression of both genes is altered during disease states."

    "content": "Results\n\nSurveillance and Resistance\n\nOf 975 culture-confirmed Campylobacter infections in the study, 177 (18.2%) were infected with a quinolone-resistant isolate, whereas 3 (0.3%) isolates were erythromycin-resistant. Linked microbiologic and epidemiologic data were obtained from 678 (69.5%) patients. In total, 152 (22.4%) patients had been outside Denmark within 1 week before illness, whereas 526 (77.6%) were domestically acquired infections. The three erythromycin-resistant isolates were all C. coli, two of them were also quinolone-resistant, and these were both isolated from travelers returning to Denmark from Spain and Portugal, respectively.\n\nQuinolone resistance was significantly associated with the origin of infection: 76 (50.0%) of 152 infections among travelers returning to Denmark were quinolone-resistant whereas 52 (9.9%) of 526 of domestically infected patients were infected with a quinolone-resistant strain (p < 0.001) (Table 1). For both C. coli and C. jejuni, a significantly higher proportion of quinolone-resistant infections was found among patients who had been abroad in the week before onset of illness than among patients with domestically acquired infections (risk ratio [RR] 9.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 63.8, p = 0.004 and RR 4.9, CI 3.6 to 6.7, p < 0.001). A higher proportion of C. coli than C. jejuni infections were acquired abroad (48.3% compared with 21.3% of C. jejuni).\n\nForeign travel was associated with different prevalences of quinolone resistance, depending on destination (Table 2). No travelers returning from other Scandinavian countries hosted quinolone-resistant Campylobacter isolates, whereas travel to a number of regions and subregions, including southern Europe and Southeast Asia, was significantly associated with a high proportion of quinolone-resistant infections.\n\nC. jejuni infections and C. coli infections did not differ in severity, as assessed by frequency of diarrhea, blood in stool, abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, mean duration of illness, or admission to hospitals. However, the mean duration of illness was longer for the 86 patients with quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infections and a known duration of illness (median 13.2 days) than for the 381 patients with quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni infections and a known duration of illness (median 10.3 days, p = 0.001). The association with extended length of illness was independent of foreign travel. For domestically acquired infections, the mean duration of illness was 12.4 and 10.4 days for quinolone-resistant and quinolone-sensitive infections, respectively. For comparison, the mean duration of illness for travel-associated infections was 13.9 and 10.3 days for quinolone-resistant and quinolone-sensitive infections, respectively. For C. coli, no difference in mean duration of illness was observed between quinolone-resistant and quinolone-sensitive infections.\n\nCase-Comparison Study\n\nFrom December 1, 2001, to June 10, 2002, 42 patients were infected by quinolone-resistant C. jejuni isolates, and these patients were matched with 84 patients with quinolone-sensitive isolates. No patients were connected on epidemiologic grounds of a recognized outbreak. The patients with quinolone-resistant isolates had a mean age of 33 years (interquartile range 20–45 years), and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.2. For comparison, patients with quinolone-resistant isolates in the larger study, which were not included in the case-comparison study, had a mean age of 31 years (interquartile range 20–45 years), and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.3. No strains changed susceptibility category after being retested. However, one case-patient was shown to be co-infected with two C. jejuni strains with identical serotype and RiboGroup, but with different susceptibility patterns, i.e., one strain was clearly sensitive (MIC of quinolone = 2 mg/L), whereas the MIC of quinolone for the other one was 128 to >256 mg/L on multiple repeated testings. Subsequent nucleotide sequence analysis indicated a normal consensus sequence in the former and a Thr-86 to Ala-86 mutation and three silent mutations in gyrA in the latter. The patient had not been exposed to fluoroquinolones before stool specimen collection.\n\nRisk factors for a quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infection identified in the univariate analysis and in the multiple logistic regression analysis are presented in Table 3. According to the multiple logistic regression analysis, the only exposures independently associated with an increased risk for quinolone-resistant C. jejuni infection were foreign travel (OR = 16.81), eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey (OR = 19.10), and swimming (OR = 5.01). Eating fresh chicken (of presumably Danish origin) was associated with a decreased risk (OR = 0.04). Age group did not affect the findings (younger or older than 15 years of age) in either the univariate or the multiple logistic regression analysis.\n\nThe case-comparison study identified 12 quinolone-resistant cases that were domestically acquired. However, to determine the sources of infection for the domestically acquired quinolone-resistant infections, an unmatched subanalysis on domestically acquired infections (quinolone-resistant versus quinolone-sensitive) was performed. Infections treated with fluoroquinolones before specimen collection were excluded. In this model, the parameter estimates did not change substantially from the primary model, but because of the lower sample size, the confidence intervals increased, and only eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey had p value <0.05. In 10 (11.9%) of 84 domestically acquired infections, patients reported eating fresh poultry other than chicken and turkey compared with 4 (9.5%) of 42 infections in persons with travel-related infections.\n\nOverall, we found information on antimicrobial drugs received by 122 of 126 patients. Forty patients (32.8%) were treated with antimicrobial agents for their campylobacteriosis; of these, 33 patients (27%) received a fluoroquinolone, 6 patients (4.9%) received a macrolide, and 1 patient (1%) received both a fluoroquinolone and a macrolide for the C. jejuni infection.\n\nCampylobacter Isolates from Retail Food Products and Broiler Chickens\n\nThe human isolates were included in a database and compared with 180 Campylobacter isolates obtained from retail food products (chicken [n = 139], turkey [n = 39], and pork [n = 2]) and 49 isolates from broiler chicken fecal samples obtained from the same geographic area and time period as the human isolates. Most (63%) food isolates were from Danish-bred food animals; the remaining isolates were from imported food from France (n = 48), Italy (n = 7), and the United Kingdom (n = 9). The origin of three chicken isolates was unknown. Of 180 isolates obtained from food products of both domestic and foreign origin, 153 (85%) isolates and 27 (15%) isolates were C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively (Table 1). Thirteen (8.5%) of 153 C. jejuni isolates and 8 (29.6%) of 27 C. coli isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid. Three (2.0%) of 153 C. jejuni isolates and 5 (18.5%) of 27 C. coli isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Two isolates (one C. jejuni and one C. coli) from domestic chicken products were resistant to both antimicrobial agents. A subanalysis of resistance status by origin of 139 retail chicken products (domestic versus imported) showed that 7 (8.0%) of 87 C. jejuni isolates and three (60%) of five C. coli isolates from domestic raised chicken products were resistant to nalidixic acid. Of isolates from imported chicken products, 5 (14.7%) (3 isolates from France and 2 isolates from the United Kingdom) of 34 C. jejuni isolates and 1 (10%) (from France) of 10 C. coli isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid.\n\nOf 49 isolates from broiler chicken fecal samples, 39 (79.6%) were C. jejuni and 10 (20.4%) were C. coli (Table 1). Two isolates (4.1%) (both C. jejuni) were nalidixic acid–resistant; one was also erythromycin-resistant. Five (10.2%) isolates (four C. jejuni, one C. coli) were erythromycin-resistant.\n\nSerotyping and Molecular Subtyping of Isolates\n\nWe found 133 combinations of serotypes and RiboGroups (hereafter subtypes) among 496 typed isolates (10 isolates were not tested or nontypeable) from domestically acquired C. jejuni infections (Table 4). Eighteen (13.5%) subtypes were identified exclusively among quinolone-resistant isolates, 102 (76.7%), exclusively among quinolone-sensitive isolates, and 13 (9.8%) among both resistant and sensitive isolates.\n\nFive of 11 subtypes of quinolone-resistant C. jejuni found among isolates from retail food products, broiler chickens, or both were also found among quinolone-resistant domestically acquired C. jejuni isolates from humans, and 34 of 88 subtypes of quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni found among isolates from retail food products, broiler chickens, or both were also found among quinolone-sensitive domestically acquired C. jejuni isolates from humans.\n\nPatients with domestically acquired quinolone-sensitive C. jejuni infections were more likely to have a C. jejuni subtype that was also identified among retail food products and broiler chickens than were patients with domestically acquired quinolone-resistant infections (270 of 444 vs. 15 of 51, RR = 2.07, CI 1.34 to 3.18, p < 0.001)."

The cohort was evenly split by gender, the mean age of participants was 14.4 years (SD = 1.03), and overall, the mean social disinhibition score was very close to the middle of the range of values (3.3; SD = 1.9). Males had a significantly higher mean social disinhibition score than females (F = 34.4, df = 1, P ≤ 0.001). Age was also significantly associated with mean social disinhibition score (F = 13.7, df = 5, P < 0.001); youth ≥14 years of age had higher mean scores than youth 12 or 13 years of age.\n\nYouth with at least one parent who had completed high school or had attained additional education past high school reported higher mean social disinhibition scores compared with youth whose parents did not graduate high school (F = 5.2, df = 2, P = 0.006). The mean linguistic acculturation score for the cohort was 3.5 (SD = 0.9); participants with higher linguistic acculturation scores reported higher mean social disinhibition scores (F = 30.7, df = 2, P < 0.001) compared to their less acculturated counterparts. Participants' mean TAS and DAS scores were 6.9 (SD = 3.3) and 1.2 (SD = 1.6), respectively. Both scores were significantly and positively associated with mean social disinhibition score (P < 0.001 for both).\n\nA total of 672 candidate SNPs were genotyped. Ten SNPs had a Gencall score of less than 95%, 78 additional SNPs failed the minor allele frequency test (MAF <0.05), and 19 SNPs failed the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test (P < 0.000001). A total of 565 SNPs were included in the analyses. There were 60 SNPs with P < 0.05 based on the best genetic model fit (additive, dominant, or recessive), adjusting for age and sex. After controlling for false discovery, we identified 11 SNPs with a statistically significant BFDP of <0.8 and a prior probability of 0.05.\n\nFor the principal components analysis, we used N = 1132 participants and 511 SNPs which were shown to be unassociated with the social disinhibition outcome in univariate analyses at a significance level of 0.05 based on the best genetic model fit (additive, dominant, or recessive model). We did not observe significant ethnic stratification in our data from the principal components analysis. Because only the top three eigenvalues (derived from the top three principal components) were significantly larger than the subsequent eigenvalues, we used these 3 largest principal components in our analyses (Tian et al.,; Nassir et al.,). We also considered controlling for the top 5 and top 10 largest principal components but found no significant difference in the association between SNPs and social disinhibition.\n\nSix of the 11 SNPs were found to be significant at α = 0.05 level in the final multivariable model, which included demographic and psychosocial characteristics as well as the three largest principal components terms. Two of these SNPs are in the serotonin pathway (rs9534511 on HTR2A and rs4938056 on HTR3B), and one is in an intronic region of an opioid receptor gene (rs1998220 on OPRM1). One SNP (rs1003921) resides in an intronic region of KCNC1, one SNP (rs16116) is in an intergenic region downstream of NPY, and one SNP (rs16870286) is part of LINC00518, a miscellaneous RNA gene that codes for an uncharacterized protein. Information about these SNPs, including model used, multivariable P-value, and allelic frequency, is shown in Table 2.\n\nParameter estimates for the final multivariable model are shown in Table 3. Age, linguistic acculturation, TAS, and DAS were all significantly positively associated with increased risk of social disinhibition (P < 0.001). Each 1-year increase in age was estimated to increase social disinhibition score by 0.20 points (95% CI = 0.12–0.29), and each 1-point increase in a participant's overall linguistic acculturation score was expected to increase their social disinhibition score by 0.30 points (95% CI = 0.20–0.41). Similarly, each 1-unit increase in TAS or DAS score is expected to increase participants' social disinhibition score by 0.20 (95% CI = 0.17–0.23) and 0.45 points (95% CI = 0.40–0.51), respectively. Gender and parental education, however, were not significantly associated with social disinhibition score (P = 0.54 and P = 0.13, respectively).\n\nMinor alleles for three of the SNPs were associated with increased risk of social disinhibition (rs1998220, rs9534511, and rs4938056), while the other three SNPs' minor alleles were associated with protective effects (rs16116, rs16870286, and rs1003921). For those SNPs that were positively associated with increased social disinhibition score, parameter estimates (the amount a minor allele was estimated to change social disinhibition score by) ranged from 0.19 (rs1998220; 95% CI = 0.06–0.32, P = 0.003) to 0.32 (rs9534511; 95% CI = 0.14–0.50, P < 0.001). Parameter estimates for SNPs that were negatively associated with increased social disinhibition score ranged from −0.29 (rs16116; 95% CI = −0.48 to −0.09, P = 0.004) to −0.64 (rs1003921; 95% CI = −1.13 to −0.15, P = 0.011)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nFigure 1 depicts the regulatory and coding regions of CNR1 based on the study by Zhang et al and the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Analyses were focused on rs2023239 found in the region upstream of exon 3, which has been described as an alternative promoter. Each approach described in the “Methods” section has a corresponding result subsection.\n\nCB1 BINDING LEVELS IN POSTMORTEM PFC\n\nTo test the association between rs2023239 and CB1 receptor levels, CB1 binding was quantified in postmortem human PFC and the relationship between rs2023239 and CB1 binding was assessed. Ten samples were genotyped as TT and 10 as CT. The ANOVA revealed that individuals with the CT genotype for rs2023239 demonstrated significantly greater CB1 binding in Brodmann areas 9 and 10 compared with individuals with the TT genotype (F1,16 = 9.62, P < .01) (Figure 2).\n\nCUE-ELICITED CRAVING AND BRAIN ACTIVATION\n\nBecause CNR1 receptors modulate the mesocorticolimbic neurocircuitry that underlies drug-seeking behavior in animals, it was expected that the genetic variation that alters CB1 receptor levels would also be associated with the differential activation of these structures during exposure to alcohol cues. To explore the functional significance of rs2023239, data from a recent neuroimaging study were reanalyzed. Participants were 34 heavy drinkers who were right-handed and had no history of psychiatric or neurologic disorders. Two participants had the CC genotype and 8 had the CT genotype. Individuals with at least 1 copy of C (n=10; mean [SD] age, 21.5 [0.71] years; 7 men; all white participants) were age matched with 24 participants who had the TT genotype (mean [SD] age, 22.5 [1.59] years; 17 men; 21 white, 1 Asian, and 2 Latin American participants).\n\nThe CT group demonstrated greater activation when alcohol was contrasted with inactive (ie, rest) and active (ie, litchi juice) appetitive controls in the NAcc, VMPFC, VTA, and OFC compared with the TT group (P < .05) (Figure 3). Pearson product moment correlations between peak activity in these regions and subjective measures indicated several significant findings. In the CT group, the alcohol use disorder score, measured using the AUDIT, was significantly correlated with activation of the NAcc (r = 0.83, P = .003) and the VMPFC (r = 0.68, P = .03) using the alcohol vs active control contrast. In addition, the urge to consume alcohol in the CT group, as measured using the total AUQ score, was also significantly correlated with the VMPFC (r = 0.67, P = .03), the left OFC (r = 0.80, P = .005), and the right OFC (r = 0.62, P = .06). The only correlations that were significant in the TT group were the correlations between the left and right OFC and the AUDIT score (r = 0.42, P < .05 and r = 0.51, P = .01) (Table).\n\nSHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON SUBJECTIVE REWARD\n\nA human laboratory study was conducted to determine whether rs2023239 was associated with the rewarding effects of alcohol. Fifty-six individuals had the TT genotype, 15 had the CT genotype, and 3 had the CC genotype for rs2023239. The individuals with the CC and CT genotypes were combined into 1 group to facilitate analyses. The first set of analyses tested for differences between the TT and CT groups on demographics and alcohol/ other drug use variables. There were no differences in self-reported ancestry. There was 1 individual with African American ancestry in the TT group; the CT group included 1 Latin American, 1 Asian, and 1 African American individual. Of the TT group, 50% smoked tobacco, and of the CT group, 54% smoked tobacco. There were no significant differences (P > .05) between the TT and CT groups in mean (SD) age (21.6 [3] years vs 22.4 [3] years), sex (66% vs 79% male), or mean (SD) past-month quantity of alcohol use measured using a 30-day timeline follow-back method (72 [50] vs 72 [41] standard drinks). Mean breath alcohol levels after each of the 3 drinks were 0.018%, 0.038%, and 0.055% and did not differ by genotype. To ensure that population stratification was not a confounding factor, analyses were repeated with only the white individuals. No differences emerged.\n\nThe primary analyses focused on the reward and positive affect scales of the Profile of Mood States. The analyses involved a 2 (genotype: TT vs CT or CC) × 3 (drink: 1 vs 2 vs 3) repeated-measures ANOVA. The dependent variable was the difference between the alcohol and placebo beverage scores for each drink. Analyses revealed a significant main effect for genotype (F1,69 = 4.27, P <.05) such that individuals with the CT genotype reported significantly greater reward and positive affect after drinking (F1,69 = 6.27, P < .05) (Figure 4A and B).\n\nTo determine whether these results could be replicated with an earlier study, data from a previously published study were reanalyzed. This previous study allowed us to examine the interaction between a medication that targets the dopamine system (olanzapine) and rs2023239. The analyses involved a 2 (medication: olanzapine vs cyproheptadine hydrochloride) × 2 (genotype: TT vs CT and CC) × 3 (drink: 1 vs 2 vs 3) repeated-measures ANOVA. The analyses revealed a genotype × drink interaction (F2,112 = 5.19, P = .01) such that individuals with the CT genotype reported greater reward from the alcoholic beverages. There were no significant genotype × medication interactions on this measure (P > .05). In lieu of positive affect, we examined self-reported high. The analyses revealed a significant medication × genotype × drink interaction on self-reported high (F2,112 = 3.39, P < .05). Individuals with the CT (or CC) genotype (n = 9) who received the active control medication (cyproheptadine) reported the greatest high after the third drink (Figure 4C). There were no significant differences between individuals with the CT genotype and those with the TT genotype for the olanzapine condition (Figure 4D).\n\nCUE-ELICITED CRAVING AND TREATMENT OUTCOME\n\nGiven the suggestion that there might be an interaction between CNR1 variation and olanzapine on the rewarding effects of alcohol, we reanalyzed data from a recent clinical trial of olanzapine. This study examined the effects of olanzapine (5 mg) on cue-elicited craving and drinks per drinking day during a 12-week trial in a sample of treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals. In the reanalysis, rs2023239 was included as a moderator. There were 23 individuals in the CT group and 46 individuals in the TT group. The analyses revealed a significant medication × genotype × cue interaction on craving (F1,65 = 5.29, P < .05) such that individuals with the CT genotype reported greater cue-elicited craving when treated with placebo vs olanzapine (Figure 5A and B). Individuals with the CT genotype reported greater drinks per drinking day compared with individuals with the TT genotype when treated with placebo vs olanzapine (F1,65 = 3.94, P = .05) (Figure 5C and D)."

    "content": "Findings\n\nExogenous lipid metabolism involves packaging of dietary fat into chylomicrons in the small intestine, which are later transported to the bloodstream. The initial step of endogenous lipid metabolism involves the hydrolysis of chylomicrons by lipoprotein lipase (LPL). LPL deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 1,000,000 in the United States and higher in other world regions, like Quebec, Canada due to a founder effect. The clinical presentation can include moderate or severe hypertriglyceridemia in affected homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, while simple heterozygote carriers often have normal lipids. Clinical features include eruptive xanthomas, abdominal pain, hepato-splenomegaly, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, recurrent pancreatitis, or lipemia retinalis. Dietary fat restriction is the cornerstone of treatment, and gene therapy trials are ongoing.\n\nCase report\n\nWe report the case of an 11-week-old male of Puerto Rican descent who presented to the emergency department with coffee-ground emesis, melena and a papular rash. He was born full term to healthy, nonconsanguineous parents with a birth weight of 8 lb 4 oz and was exclusively breast-fed. He had 4–5 episodes of coffee-ground emesis, one episode of melena and a papular rash (Fig. 1) that spread from his extremities to his trunk over the course of 3 weeks. CBC revealed a hematocrit of 17 % and his blood was grossly lipemic. A random lipid panel showed triglycerides (TG) of 43,980 mg/dl.\n\nThe physical exam was notable for a well-appearing infant with diffuse 2 mm yellow papules consistent with eruptive xanthomas and lipemia retinalis on fundoscopic exam. Fasting lipid profile revealed total cholesterol 768 mg/dl, TG 37,695 mg/dl, and HDL < 10 mg/dl. Breast-feeding was discontinued and he was placed on Enfaport Lipil, a formula with 84 % of fat content from medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and 16 % from long-chain fats. A repeat lipid profile one month after the formula change revealed dramatic improvement in TG (Table 1). Two months after treatment, xanthomas and lipemia retinalis resolved; weight gain and linear growth were normal. We hypothesized that this child had an autosomal recessive mutation in the LPL gene.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics, consent and permission:Approval was obtained from the Western University Ethics Review Board protocol 07920E and informed consent was obtained from both parents. The parents gave their consent to publish this case.\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, QIAGEN Inc, Mississauga, ON, Canada). PCR amplifications were performed using primers covering the coding regions and ~100 bp of intron-exon boundaries of the LPL gene as described previously. Bi-directional Sanger sequencing was performed using established conditions on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). DNA sequences were analyzed using SeqScape v2.6 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).\n\nResults and discussion\n\nWe found that the proband was a compound heterozygote for one novel and one reported mutation within exon 5 of the LPL gene (Fig. 2). The first mutation p.G215E was a heterozygous transition c.644G → A, resulting in a substitution of glycine to glutamic acid at amino acid 215 (identical to residue 188 in the mature protein). This mutation has been previously reported to cause LPL deficiency. The second, novel mutation p.Q240H was a heterozygous transversion c.721G → T, causing an amino acid substitution of glutamine to histidine at residue 240 (identical to residue 213 in the mature protein). In silico software programs PolyPhen2 and SIFT both predicted that this mutation was probably damaging. Both parents' DNA samples were sequenced: the LPL p.Q240H mutation was found in the father and the p.G215E mutation was found in the mother.\n\nLPL plays a role in multiple stages of lipid metabolism, including hydrolysis of chylomicrons. LPL is primarily synthesized by myocytes and adipocytes and recent studies have identified glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) as the molecule responsible for transporting LPL to the capillary lumen. LPL deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by decreased LPL activity due to mutations in the LPL gene. The LPL gene is located on chromosome 8p21.3 and contains 10 exons, spanning ~ 30 kb and encodes a mature protein of 448 amino acids. Most mutations are found in exons 4, 5 and 6 and although missense mutations are more common, nonsense, frameshift, insertion, deletion and duplication mutations have also been described. The mutation in this patient expands the spectrum of known pathogenic LPL mutations to more than 150. It also occurs in a region of the protein that has to date been relatively bereft of reported mutations. The involvement of amino acid residue 240 also highlights the functional importance of the local domain in lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.\n\nTo date, genotype-phenotype correlations have not been identified. Patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygotes can present with marked hypertriglyceridemia. Heterozygote patients can have normal or mildly elevated TG levels. Both parents of our patient are heterozygous carriers of LPL gene mutations and had normal lipids.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of LPL deficiency are heterogeneous. Eruptive xanthomas appear mostly on shoulders, buttocks and extensor surfaces of the limbs when the TG levels exceed 2000 mg/dl. Lipemia retinalis involving the peripheral vessels can be seen with TG levels over 2,500 mg/dl and as the levels increase, the damage extends to the posterior pole. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal hemorrhage have been attributed to hyperviscosity secondary to elevated TG. Pancreatitis is common in these patients and risk increases with TG levels over 1,000 mg/dl. Therefore, the goal of therapy is to decrease TG levels < 1,000 mg/dl.\n\nDietary restriction remains the cornerstone of treatment and fat supplements using MCT are useful since they are absorbed directly into the portal vein. Long-term data on patients with LPL deficiency are limited but show normal linear growth and puberty despite dietary fat restriction. Even with recurrent pancreatitis, this population does not demonstrate a high mortality rate. Satisfactory TG levels can be difficult to achieve with diet restriction alone. Drug therapy using gemfibrozil, omega-3 fatty acids and orlistat may decrease TG levels when combined with a fat-restricted diet however, the use of these drugs is controversial. Therapy involving intramuscular introduction of a gain-of-function variant of the LPL gene is approved in Europe, although is costly and has only a transient effect. A promising treatment approach currently under investigation is orally-administered diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) inhibitors targeting DGAT1, which mediates triglyceride synthesis during dietary fat absorption.\n\nOur patient is a compound heterozygote who has a novel p.Q240H mutation in exon 5 of the LPL gene causing severe hypertriglyceridemia. Although his TG levels are much improved with MCT-based formula, the challenge will be maintaining those levels with dietary fat restriction as table foods are introduced and he grows through childhood.\n\nCompeting interests\n\nAngela Ganan Soto, Adam McIntyre, Sungeeta Agrawal, Shara R.

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nFull Sample (n=138)\n\nEfficacy\n\nTable 1 shows the proportion of patients experiencing no HDDs during the last month of treatment. As reported in Kranzler et al. in the full sample, 36% of patients treated with topiramate reported no HDDs during the last month of treatment compared to 17% in the placebo group, an NNT of 5.29.\n\nAdverse Events\n\nThe vast majority of patients reported at least one adverse event, including 96% of the topiramate group and 86% of the placebo group, a non-significant difference (χ2(1df)=3.73, p=0.053). Although most adverse events were rated as mild, the mean severity rating was significantly greater in the topiramate group [1.3 (SD=0.4)] than in the placebo group [1.1 (SD=0.5)] (F1,136=8.86, p=0.003). Among topiramate patients, 78% reported at least one adverse event of moderate or greater severity compared to 48% for placebo. Taking into account the presence of moderate or greater adverse events yielded an adverse-event-adjusted NNT (NNT-AEmod+) of 7.52. The percentage of patients reporting a severe or greater adverse event was 16% for topiramate and 3% for placebo, yielding an adverse-event-adjusted NNT (NNT-AEsev+) of 6.12.\n\nEuropean-American Subgroup (n=122)\n\nThe last two columns of Table 1 show the response and adverse event rates for EA patients by treatment and genotype group.\n\nEfficacy\n\nAs previously reported, rs2832407 moderated the effect of topiramate in EAs. Among rs2832407*C-homozygotes, 57% of those treated with topiramate had no HDDs during the last month of treatment, compared to 13% of placebo patients, an NNT of 2.28. In contrast, among A-allele carriers, there was a very small difference in the likelihood of no HDDs during the last month of treatment (20% of topiramate patients and 19% of placebo patients), an NNT of 180.00. The 95% CI for this NNT (5.22 to −5.57) shows that the conditions were equivalent, i.e., topiramate had no discernible effect on the risk of HDDs in the last month of treatment.\n\nAdverse Events\n\nNearly all individuals (i.e., 92%) in both rs2832407 genotype groups experienced one or more adverse events (χ2(1df)=0.02, p=0.90). Among rs2832407*C-homozygotes, topiramate-treated patients reported a mean adverse event severity of 1.3 (SD=0.3), compared with 1.1 (SD=0.5) in the placebo group, a non-significant difference (F1,49=3.31, p=0.075). Among A-allele carriers treated with topiramate the mean adverse event severity was 1.5 (SD=0.3), compared with 1.1 (SD=0.6) in the placebo group, a highly significant difference (F1,69=11.51, p=0.001). The interaction of medication group X genotype group on this severity measure was not significant (F1,118=0.83, p=0.37).\n\nA majority of rs2832407*C-homozygotes reported an adverse event that was moderate or greater in severity, including 67% of topiramate patients and 53% of placebo patients, a non-significant difference (χ2(1df)=0.91, p=0.34). NNT-AEmod+ was 2.63 (i.e., when adjusted for adverse events that were moderate or greater in severity). Fourteen percent of topiramate patients and 3% of placebo patients experienced a severe adverse event, yielding an NNT-AEsev+ of 2.56.\n\nAmong rs2832407*A-allele carriers, 89% of topiramate patients and 44% of placebo patients experienced a moderate or greater adverse event. This yielded an NNT-AEmod+ of 322.16. Twenty percent of topiramate patients and 3% of placebo patients experienced a severe adverse event, an NNT-AEsev+ of 217.45.\n\nAccounting for the rate of treatment completion did not change the results substantially (data not shown), consistent with the high rate of completion in both medication groups (topiramate: 82.1%; placebo: 87.3%)."

    "content": "Results\n\nChromosome-wide investigation of lactase gene regulation\n\nTo explore epigenetic contributions to lactase non-persistence and persistence, we obtained surgical jejunum samples from unrelated human adults (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and isolated villi enterocytes (intestinal epithelial cells) from the jejunum (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Across individuals there was a wide range of steady-state LCT mRNA levels; differing up to 29-fold (Supplementary Fig. 1c).\n\nWe then explored chromosome-wide DNA modification patterns in the human enterocyte samples (cohort 1, n = 56 individuals). The unmodified DNA fraction was enriched using the mTAG-click method, followed by interrogation on Affymetrix high density human tiling arrays. The arrays used surveyed human chromosome 2, which contains LCT (and the same array also contained chromosomes 9 and 19). Examination across chromosome 2 identified 5 probes that exhibited significant correlation between steady-state LCT mRNA and the density of unmodified cytosines (FDR q = 0.017, R2 = 0.28–0.32). All 5 probes clustered in a ~170 bp region of LCT exon 1–intron 1, where higher DNA modification densities associated with lower LCT mRNA levels (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). As expected, no significant associations between DNA modification and LCT mRNA levels were detected on chromosomes 9 and 19 (Supplementary Fig. 2). DNA modifications in the jejunum lacking enterocytes also did not exhibit any significant correlations with LCT mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\nWe next investigated whether DNA modification changes are involved in the age-related decline of the lactase gene. For this experiment, we compared chromosome-wide DNA modification profiles of jejunal enterocytes of infant and adult mice (postnatal day 6 vs. 60, respectively). Similar to lactase non-persistence in humans, mice show high intestinal lactase activity at birth, followed by a gradual decrease after infancy. Indeed, we found that Lct mRNA in the jejunum of inbred C57BL/6N adult mice at postnatal day 60 was reduced by 3-fold compared to infant mice at postnatal day 6 (p < 10−4; Supplementary Fig. 4a). For the epigenetic analysis, we used the mTAG-click method to enrich the unmodified DNA fraction from infant and adult jejunal enterocytes, followed by interrogation on mouse tiling microarrays. We detected that 0.4% of probes in mouse chromosome 1, which contains Lct, exhibited significant differential DNA modification between the two age groups (11,206 probes, FDR q < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data Set 1). Of these differentially-modified probes, 30 probes mapped to within 100 kb of Lct, clustering into 3 regions: Lct intron 2–exon 3, intron 8–exon 9, and exon 10 (~60–700 bp region size; 1.36- to 2.25-fold change; Supplementary Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 1). At all these regions, adult animals demonstrated significantly greater densities of modified cytosines compared to infants (FDR q < 0.01), indicating an inverse relationship between DNA modification and Lct mRNA levels. Thus chromosome-wide analysis revealed epigenetically-modified regions in the lactase gene of both mice and humans, which may be important for its transcriptional regulation and the establishment of lactase non-persistence.\n\nInter-individual and cell-type specific LCT regulatory sites\n\nTo complement the broad but relatively low resolution of the microarray-based approach, we fine-mapped the extended human LCT region using bisulfite padlock probe sequencing. For this, we designed 466 padlock probes covering a ~100 kb genomic region encompassing LCT (49 kb) and MCM6 (37 kb). In addition to the first cohort used in the microarray experiment, a second cohort of jejunum samples (n = 59 individuals) was added to this investigation, for a total of 115 samples (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We first examined the regions mediating human inter-individual differences in LCT. In this analysis, we performed correlations between DNA modification densities and LCT mRNA levels. In enterocytes, significant inverse correlations were detected between DNA modification density and steady-state LCT mRNA levels at 11 CpG sites (p < 0.01–10−10 after Bonferroni correction). These 11 CpGs clustered into 2 regions: MCM6 intron 13–exon 13 (~600 bp region size; R2 = 0.27–0.53), which surrounds the lactase persistence and non-persistence SNP C/T-13910, and MCM6 exon 16 (~30 bp region size; R2 = 0.20–0.25; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Table 1). This suggests that epigenetically-controlled regions within MCM6 may mediate individual differences in LCT mRNA.\n\nWe then identified regions involved in the cell-type specific expression of LCT by comparing the DNA modification profiles of enterocytes with that of the enterocyte-deficient jejunum of the same individuals. Significant DNA modification differences were observed at 35 CpG sites (p < 0.01–10−14 after Bonferroni correction), which clustered into seven distinct regions: LCT intron 5, intron 3, intron 2, exon 1, as well as MCM6 exon 17, exon 16 and intron 13 (~25–560 bp region size; 1.35- to 2.51-fold change between jejunum and enterocytes; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). The MCM6 intron 13 and exon 16 regions each overlapped the regions identified in the inter-individual analysis above. The LCT exon 1 and intron 2 regions we identified by targeted bisulfite sequencing were close to the respective regions detected in the tiling microarrays (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Notably, the region in LCT intron 5 mapped to the promoter of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), LOC100507600, while the exon 17 region mapped to 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) of MCM6.\n\nWe also investigated whether the association of DNA modifications with LCT was unique to enterocytes or could be extended to tissue that does not express LCT mRNA. In white blood cells (n = 58 individuals), the seven LCT–MCM6 regions were nearly fully modified and therefore vastly differed from those of intestinal tissues (averaged % DNA modification in blood, enterocyte-deficient jejunum and enterocytes: 73.3%±0.4%, 54.2%±0.8% and 37.1%±0.9%, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 5). This provides additional support that these regions facilitate the cell-type specificity of LCT modification.\n\nTo further explore the regulatory functions of the differentially modified LCT regions, we investigated chromatin reference maps of the human small intestine (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2) generated by the Epigenomics Roadmap. Our discovered regions in LCT exon 1, introns 2 and 3, as well as MCM6 intron 13, exon 16 and 3′-UTR overlapped with DNase I hypersensitivity sites. Moreover, histone marks characteristic of active enhancers, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, were detected at LCT introns 2 and 3, as well as MCM6 intron 13 and exon 16 to 3′-UTR. No other enhancer sites were observed elsewhere in a 100 kb region centered over LCT and MCM6. Meanwhile, LCT exon 1 had an abundance of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, indicative of an active promoter. Hence, functional chromatin signatures corroborate well with the sites we identified in our DNA modification study, further supporting the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of LCT.\n\nGenotype-dependent and temporal changes in LCT modification\n\nSince LCT–MCM6 haplotypes exhibit a strong association with lactase non-persistence and persistence in adult Europeans, we hypothesized that differential epigenetic modifications could occur in such haplotypes, contributing to the age-dependent regulation of LCT. To test this, we examined whether different genetic backgrounds at LCT–MCM6 led to a divergence of DNA modifications in an age-dependent fashion. We first genotyped two MCM6 SNPs (C/T-13910, rs4988235 and G/A-22018, rs182549) and an insertion-deletion in the 3′ region of LCT intron 1 in the intestine samples (n = 115 individuals). All three genotypes showed association with steady-state LCT mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 6a) and exhibited strong pairwise linkage disequilibrium (D′ > 0.9; Supplementary Fig. 6b), consistent with previous reports. Further analysis focused on the SNP C/T-13910, for which C and T alleles are parts of the haplotypes associated with lactase non-persistence and lactase persistence, respectively.\n\nWe next investigated DNA modification changes at the seven regulatory regions (described in the above sections) in enterocyte samples stratified for genetic background. We observed that CC carriers (lactase non-persistent) displayed major DNA modification differences in comparison to TT carriers (lactase persistent) in the MCM6 locus, particularly at the MCM6 intron 13–exon 13 (82.1±2.6% vs. 19.3±4.1%; p < 10−17) where the SNP C/T-13910 resides (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 6c). Our postdiction is that MCM6 intron 13 completes most of its age-dependent epigenetic changes during the first two decades after birth (prior to the age of the youngest individuals in our sample set ranging from 21–72 years old). Indeed, DNA modification changes at MCM6 intron 13 for the haplotypes containing C-13910 must occur after conception, as our investigation of sperm samples (n = 18 individuals) revealed no DNA modification differences between CC, CT and TT genotypes at this region (>94% modified in all genotypes; data not shown). It can be hypothesized that such DNA modifications are erased at embryogenesis, enabling high postnatal LCT activity, followed by their gradual regain with age in a haplotype-specific fashion. The situation with MCM6 exon 16 is likely similar, as it also shows significant differences between C-13910 and T-13910 carrying haplotypes (52.7±3.1% vs. 32.8±4.1%; p < 0.01; Fig. 3), though it amasses more gradual DNA modification changes compared to MCM6 intron 13.\n\nMolecular events associated with lactase non-persistence or persistence do not stop at childhood or youth. In our cohort of 21–72-year-old individuals, we detected that LCT mRNA was significantly decreasing with age in the lactase non-persistent (CC) individuals (R2 = 0.2, p < 0.01), but showed no aging changes in the intermediate (CT) individuals, and a non-significant increase in lactase persistent (TT) individuals (R2 = 0.13, p = 0.2). We then investigated age-related DNA modification changes within each of the seven regulatory regions in the enterocyte samples stratified for C/T-13910 genotypes. In lactase non-persistent individuals (CC), DNA modifications consistently increased with age across LCT and MCM6 (Fig. 4). Conversely, lactase persistent (TT) individuals showed mostly decreasing DNA modification densities in MCM6 and LCT with age (Fig. 4) (except at the lncRNA promoter, where greater DNA modification associated with higher LCT mRNA). DNA modification changes observed in adulthood could be an extension of the LCT–MCM6 epigenetic processes occurring in childhood. Overall, our findings suggest that lactase non-persistence may be mediated by an age-related increase in DNA modifications at regulatory elements in MCM6 and LCT, while such elements are protected from epigenetic inactivation in lactase persistent individuals.\n\nEvolutionary conservation of LCT regulation\n\nWe next explored the extent of evolutionary conservation of epigenetic factors contributing to the age-dependent downregulation of the lactase gene in mammals. For this, we used 404 padlock probes and bisulfite sequenced a ~80 kb region containing Lct and Mcm6 in enterocytes of infant (6 days old) and adult (60 days old) mice. DNA modifications at Lct intron 2 and 8 (similar regions to those identified in the tiling arrays) significantly increased with age in mice (FDR q < 0.05; fold changes: 1.60 and 1.25, respectively; Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4c, 7a). In support, investigation of chromatin marks using ENCODE data of an adult (60 days old) C57BL/6N mouse identified an enhancer element (H3K27ac and H3K4me1 peaks) in Lct intron 2, along with an active promoter at Lct exon 1–intron 1 (H3K27ac, H3K4me3 and POLR2A peaks) and an inactive enhancer at Mcm6 intron 13 (only H3K4me1; Supplementary Fig. 7b).\n\nFurthermore, the LCT intron 2 region is highly conserved across mammals, and contains 7 out of 47 mammalian intronic conserved elements in LCT and MCM6 (139 conserved bases; permutation p < 10−7; Supplementary Note 1). This large degree of mammalian sequence conservation was not found in any other intron of LCT or MCM6 (including MCM6 intron 13). Thus, converging evidence indicates that LCT intron 2 is an evolutionarily old regulatory element, common in mice and humans (and potentially across all mammals) for the development of lactase non-persistence. By contrast, the regulatory regions in MCM6 appear to have emerged more recently, contributing to lactase persistence in human adults.\n\nLncRNA involvement in LCT expression\n\nWe further investigated the contribution of the previously uncharacterized lncRNA LOC100507600 to the regulation of LCT mRNA. LOC100507600 is transcribed from the opposite DNA strand than LCT. Consequently, it follows that this lncRNA is a natural antisense transcript, a type of regulatory element that can be controlled by DNA modification, and that is increasingly recognized to alter target gene expression. We examined the human jejunum cohort 2 (n = 59 individuals) and detected a strong positive correlation between LOC100507600 lncRNA and LCT mRNA (R2 = 0.73; p < 10−9; Fig. 5a).\n\nWe next investigated the capacity of the lncRNA to modulate LCT mRNA levels. We performed an RNAi experiment in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, which has the TT genotype at SNP -13910. Transfection with small-interfering RNAs directed to LOC100507600 reduced its expression by 20%, and resulted in concomitant 25% reduction in LCT mRNA (p < 0.05; Fig. 5b). Hence, LCT mRNA levels were effectively regulated by this lncRNA in cells relevant to lactase persistence. The mRNA of the non-targeted MCM6 remained unchanged by LOC100507600 silencing (Fig. 5b).\n\nTo understand how increased DNA modification at the lncRNA promoter could augment LOC100507600 lncRNA and LCT mRNA levels, we surveyed ENCODE datasets. There was a CTCF (insulator) binding site overlapping the lncRNA promoter that was nearly ubiquitous across human tissues (present in 51 out of 52 cell lines, including Caco-2). Increased DNA methylation inhibits CTCF binding at such insulator sites, which has been shown to activate tissue-specific gene expression, and facilitate the interaction of neighboring enhancers with their target promoters. However, further investigation is required to understand this LCT-regulating lncRNA.\n\nGenetic manipulation of lactase regulatory elements\n\nWe used the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to determine whether the differentially modified DNA regions indeed contribute to Lct regulation. For this, we deleted intronic regions in Lct or Mcm6, and measured the effect on steady-state Lct mRNA (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7b, 8a). We deliberately targeted intronic regions only, avoiding splicing sites and exons that may compromise Lct mRNA processing and stability. In C57BL/6N mice, we deleted the Lct intron 2 region, which showed evidence of cross-species lactase gene regulation, and separately deleted a region in Mcm6 intron 13, which was important to human LCT regulation. We also generated a deletion in Lct intron 1, serving as a positive control due to its overlap with a Lct promoter element. As a negative control, we measured Mcm6 mRNA levels in mice carrying the Mcm6 intron 13 deletion. We also surveyed and did not find any off-target activity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in 46 candidate regions (Supplementary Fig. 8b, c).\n\nIn adult and infant mice, deletion in Lct intron 1 as well as in Lct intron 2 caused widespread downregulation of Lct throughout the duodenum and jejunum (3- to 8-fold reduction; p < 0.001–10−12; Fig. 6b, c). The deletion in Mcm6 intron 13 yielded less pronounced, segment-specific Lct mRNA reductions (less than 2-fold reduction; p < 0.05–10−3; Fig. 6b, c). This intronic deletion did not alter Mcm6 mRNA levels, supporting that our CRISPR-Cas9 deletions specifically affected Lct (Fig. 6b, c). Compared to the other deletions, the mutation in Lct intron 2 produced a significantly greater loss in Lct mRNA in adults than in infants (2-fold greater reduction in adult intestine, p < 10−3; Fig. 6d). This suggests that the evolutionary conserved Lct intron 2 establishes a stronger control of Lct mRNA in adulthood, corroborating our above findings of aging mice.\n\nWe also examined the extent to which the epigenetically-regulated regions impact human LCT expression in cultured human intestinal epithelial cells, Caco-2. Caco-2 cells undergo spontaneous differentiation into enterocyte-like cells of the small intestine when grown past confluence. We assayed LCT expression in Caco-2 cells carrying a CRISPR-Cas9n-induced deletion in the regulatory elements in MCM6 intron 13 or LCT intron 2. We also deleted a region not overlapping a regulatory element in LCT intron 1, serving as a negative control. Cells were examined at a time point prior-to-confluence (undifferentiated, cancer-like state, day 6) and post-confluence (differentiated, intestine epithelial-like state, day 15). The deletions did not affect LCT mRNA expression in the undifferentiated state (Fig. 6e). However, in the differentiated, epithelial-like cell state the deletion in MCM6 intron 13 or LCT intron 2 resulted in a significant decrease in LCT mRNA levels (p < 10−3; Fig. 6e), supporting the importance of these regions in regulation of LCT expression in humans."

    "content": "Results\n\nDescriptive statistics and milk drinking profiles for all study participants are included in Table 1 (characteristics for individuals without genetic data, n=~155 overall, did not vary substantively for descriptive characteristics). Minor allele frequencies for rs4988235 within controls were observed to be 0.28 in Romania, 0.40 in Poland, 0.35 in Russia and 0.46 in the Czech Republic. The minor allele for all populations was the “T” (persistence) allele at rs4988235, consistent with that in southern and eastern Europe, but opposite to that observed in regions further north and west (the “C” allele was found at a frequency of 0.26 in the UK). No strong evidence for departure of recorded genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was found (p>0.05) except nominally in Romania (p=0.02). Whilst country specific MAF estimates are different, they do reflect intermediate frequencies of the order anticipated within Eastern European populations (Supplementary Table S1).\n\nDifferences were observed in the consumption patterns of milk in differing allele groups. In controls, genotype was seen to be associated with milk drinking OR 2.39 [1.81, 3.15], p=6.9*10−10. In all countries, a higher proportion of individuals reported never having consumed milk within those carrying the reported lactase non-persistent CC genotype at rs4988235 (Table 2). Tests of heterogeneity showed there to be no consistent evidence of difference in the association between lactase persistence genotype and milk drinking between countries (Table 2). Romania was the only country not to demonstrate association between genotype and milk drinking tendency.\n\nThere was an elevated risk of RCC among those consuming milk as opposed to never consumers (OR=1.35, 95% CI 1.03, 1.76 p=0.03). This was largely driven by the strong, observed, relationship between milk consumption and cancer risk in the Czech Republic (OR=1.68, 95% CI 1.13, 2.49 p=0.01) where the frequency of the lactase persistence driving allele and adherence to it was the greatest (Table 3).\n\nDespite observed differences between the risk of RCC with differing milk consumption patterns and between lactase persistent genotype and milk consumption patterns, no substantial differences were observed between rs4988235 genotype and the risk of RCC either in analyses by country or in the sample as a whole (overall odds of RCC by genotypic group OR=1.01, 95% CI 0.83, 1.22 p=0.9) (Table 4).\n\nAnalysis of variables which could potentially have confounded results between milk consumption and the risk of RCC yielded evidence for association between educational attainment (p=0.001) and milk consumption in all countries(Table 5). There was nominal, although not systematic, representation of this relationship and others within results for country specific data. The strongest of these was for the Czech Republic where, milk consumption was associated with educational attainment and smoking (p=0.02 and 0.007 respectively).\n\nIn contrast, analysis between rs4988235 genotype and the same potentially confounding factors did not generally yield evidence of association. However, there was nominal evidence for association of genotype with education (p=0.03, Table 5), which was largely lost after country specific analysis."

    "content": "Results\n\nCellular phenotype of Fanconi anemia cell line of unknown complementation group\n\nThe subject presented at birth with bilateral radial aplasia, absent thumbs, microcephaly, micrognathia, café au lait spots, absent left kidney (Table S1), and elevated chromosomal breakage in peripheral blood samples treated with diexpoxybutane (DEB). Peripheral blood samples tested over the years displayed decreasing chromosomal breakage levels and increasing evidence of somatic mosaicism in the hematopoietic compartment, a phenomenon seen in a small subset of FA patients (Table S2). The subject has not developed bone marrow failure at the age of 16.\n\nFibroblasts derived from the subject (RA2627) are hypersensitive to crosslinking agents MMC and DEB in survival assays (Figure 1A–B). Chromosomal breakage levels are elevated in RA2627 fibroblasts treated with DEB as compared to BJ wild type fibroblast, although slightly lower than FA-A patient cells (RA3087) (Figure 1C–D). RA2627 cells are deficient for FANCD2 monoubiquitination (Figure 1E) while the lymphoblastoid cell line (LCLs) (RA2946) derived from blood that showed mosaicism, display normal FANCD2 monoubiquitination (Figure 1F). By immunofluorescence, FANCD2 foci were not observed in RA2627 cells following 24-hour treatment with MMC (Figure 1G). These data demonstrate that the subject’s fibroblasts display deficiency of FA pathway activation, consistent with the deficiency of the FA core complex, one of the associated proteins, or the ID2 complex, while the subject’s LCLs are phenotypically reverted consistent with mosaicism observed in subject’s blood.\n\nWhole exome sequencing and high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization\n\nHigh-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of genomic DNA from the subject’s fibroblasts and peripheral blood samples did not detect deletions or duplications in the known FA genes (Table S3). Whole exome sequencing (WES) of DNA derived from proband LCLs and parental peripheral blood samples was performed. Analysis of WES data revealed a single FANCA mutation, c.2574C>G/p.Ser858Arg, previously described in FA. Normal levels of FANCA were detected by western blot in RA2627 cells (Figure 2A) and overexpression of wild type FANCA in RA2627 failed to rescue the monoubiquitination defect of FANCD2 and FANCI excluding FANCA as a causative gene in this cell line (Figure 2B–C). WES analysis identified no other mutations in reported FA genes.\n\nIdentification of biallelic UBE2T mutations in the subject\n\nRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on RA2627 fibroblasts to assess altered transcript levels that might indicate functionally significant gene mutations not captured by WES. Compared to a non-FA patient cell line (RA3380), a marked reduction in UBE2T was detected, but not for any of the known FA genes (Figure 3A). Decreased UBE2T transcript levels were confirmed by RT-qPCR (Figure 3B) and UBE2T protein was undetectable in RA2627 fibroblast lysates (Figure 3C). However, UBE2T transcript and protein were present at near normal levels in proband LCLs (RA2946) (Figure 3B, D) supporting the presence of a genetic reversion in the hematopoietic compartment.\n\nSanger sequencing of genomic DNA and cDNA from proband primary fibroblasts, parental peripheral blood, and LCLs revealed compound heterozygous mutations in UBE2T (Figure 3E, S1, S2, also see Extended Experimental Procedures). The paternally derived deletion, g.202332626_202341295del, appears to have resulted from recombination of two AluYa5 repeats within the UBE2T gene (Figure S1). This deletion is expected to be a null allele, as it results in the loss of a majority of the gene including the start codon.\n\nThe maternal duplication, g.202332626_202341295dup, also appears to be mediated by Alu recombination. The maternally derived mutation consists of a large duplication of the genomic region between the two AluYa5 repeats (Figure 3E, Figure S2). Cloning of proband cDNA revealed a transcript containing the hypothesized duplication c.-64_468dup (dupEx2_6) (Figure 3E, Figure S2D and E). In this transcript, exon 6 is spliced to the duplicated exon 2. Inclusion of the noncoding region from exon 2 results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon. The c.-64_468dup transcript can be detected at very low frequency in RA2627 cells and is likely degraded by nonsense-mediated decay due to the premature stop codon. If any transcript is translated, it may produce a residual amount of the predicted protein p.A157Cfs*7 (Figure 3E and S2). The maternally derived mutation was absent in the RA2946 LCLs. This indicates that the expression of wild type UBE2T in the proband blood may be due to recombination of the maternally derived allele (Figure S2A).\n\nComplementation of RA2627 cellular defects by wild type UBE2T expression\n\nTo prove that UBE2T deficiency is the cause of the subject’s FA, we introduced wild type UBE2T into RA2627 fibroblasts and assayed for rescue of FA phenotypes. Overexpression of UBE2T rescued cellular hypersensitivity to crosslinking agents MMC, DEB and cisplatin (Figure 4A-C). Analysis of cell cycle distribution following treatment with MMC revealed an accumulation of RA2627 cells in G2 that was rescued by UBE2T overexpression to the levels observed in wild type BJ cells (Figure 4D). UBE2T expression restored monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI (Figure 4F) and FANCD2 foci following treatment with MMC (Figure 4G). These results confirm that deficiency of UBE2T results in Fanconi anemia-T subtype."

    "content": "Results\n\nGene expression profiling of cells from DBA patients\n\nTo identify genes associated with a defect of RPS19, a whole genome expression profiling study was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Arrays which allow the screening of 18,400 transcripts, including 14,500 well-characterised genes. We analysed the gene expression profiles of dermal fibroblasts isolated from four DBA patients carrying mutations in RPS19, in comparison to those obtained from six healthy individuals. Of the 22,227 probes present on the chip, 13,396 had Affymetrix \"Present\" detection calls and intensity values more than 100 in all arrays and have been used for data analysis. A list of 490 statistically significantly differentially expressed probes was generated, 215 of which are up-regulated and 275 down-regulated in DBA patients (see additional file 1: Genes differentially expressed in DBA patients identified by microarray profiling). These probes correspond to 421 differentially expressed genes (176 up-regulated and 245 down-regulated) in patients compared to controls.\n\nWe also evaluated whether the observed differences in gene expression may be due to a gender-dependent bias. The comparison between the array data of female to male individuals irrespective of the health status yielded a list of 33 differentially expressed probes (six up-regulated and 27 down-regulated in females), corresponding to genes mainly located on chromosomes X or Y (see additional file 2: Differentially expressed genes in females relative to males). Moreover, we identified only five differentially expressed genes in female DBA patients relative to male DBA patients (see additional file 3: Differentially expressed genes in female patients relative to male patients). These results rule out the presence of gender-dependent defects in DBA patients.\n\nMicroarray analysis was performed on samples from patients carrying two missense (p.Arg62Trp and p.Arg101His), one frameshift and one splice site mutations (c.58delG and c.1-1G>A) in RPS19 (table 1). We did not identify any gene showing a statistically significant differential expression in patients with missense mutations compared to other mutation types, indicating that changes due to the specific nature of the mutational status were not found in our study.\n\nMicroarray analysis did not show any statistically significant difference in the mean expression of RPS19 when the group of patients is compared to the group of controls. This is due to the fact that two patients carried missense mutations that are expressed similarly to controls. Inspection of the microarray data relative to each patient showed that patient 4 with the frameshift mutation c.del58G had reduced RPS19 levels (fold change 0.68) as expected by activation of NMD. A slightly reduced RPS19 expression was found also in patient 3 carrying mutation c.1-1G>A (fold change 0.84). This was confirmed by qRT-PCR with a fold change of 0.76 as compared to five controls (data not shown). Mutation c.1-1G>A affects intron 1 acceptor splice site and is expected to cause exon 2 skipping. PCR using primers complementary to exon 1 (forward) and exon 4 (reverse) revealed the presence of two amplicons of 628 and 557 bp in patient 3 (figure 1a). Sequencing of PCR products confirmed that the smaller abnormal transcript lacks exon 2 which contains the canonical ATG (figure 1b). The first available ATG at position 96-98 in exon 3 is out-of-frame (nucleotide numbering uses the A of the ATG translation initiation start site as nucleotide 1): this transcript is expected to be degraded by NMD. However, we cannot rule out that the use of the in-frame ATG at codon 75 in exon 4 would generate a short protein of 71 aminoacids. Either way, a loss of function effect is expected to occur by this mutation in agreement with the assumed haploinsufficiency theory of DBA pathogenesis.\n\nBiological processes altered in DBA patients\n\nIn order to systematically detect impaired biological processes and molecular functions, we analysed the dataset of genes differentially expressed in patients relative to controls through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. The analysis identified a statistically significant enrichment of genes that belong to the following pathways (table 2): aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (LARS, WARS, GARS, SARS, QARS, EPRS), glycine, serine and threonine metabolism (PSAT1, PHGDH, GARS, CTH, SARS, SHMT2), death receptor signaling (CASP9, NFKBIA, NFKBIE, APAF1, NFKB2, NFKB1, BIRC3), role of PKR in interferon induction and antiviral response (CASP9, NFKBIA, NFKBIE, APAF1, NFKB2, NFKB1) and RAR activation (SRC, PRMT2, RDH11, ADCY3, PRKACA, NFKB2, NFKB1, MAPKAPK2, RBP1, MMP1, PTEN). In addition, analysis of the molecular function of the annotated genes revealed enrichment of gene clusters with roles in protein synthesis, including a large cluster of RP genes (RPL22, RPL27A, RPL29, RPL31, RPL14, RPL18A, RPS3, RPL18, RPL13, RPL3, RPL34, RPS2, RPS12, RPL15, RPL28), cell death, cellular development, lipid metabolism and molecular transport. Additionally, we identified clusters of genes belonging to the \"Top Bio Functions\" category of molecular and cellular functions (table 3) and diseases and disorders, which comprises cancer related genes, as well as genes involved in haematological, immunological, renal and skeletal disorders (table 4). Finally, we observed enriched clusters of genes related to the development and function of embryonic, skeletal and connective tissues (table 5).\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR validation of microarray data\n\nIn order to corroborate the microarray gene expression results, we selected seven genes among those differentially expressed in DBA patients relative to controls. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on the same RNA samples used for microarray analysis. The expression of AMPD3, CCND2, SOD2, TNFAIP3 (up-regulated in DBA patients) and COMP, WARS and ZIC1 (down-regulated in DBA patients) was tested. All genes were found to be differentially expressed in patients relative to controls and data are statistically significant (figure 2a). The correlation between qRT-PCR and microarray data is 0.7 (figure 2b), which corresponds to the value obtained in similar studies. Figure 2c shows the comparison of fold changes from qRT-PCR and microarray analysis. Microarray data showed the same trend as qRT-PCR results for all the examined genes in each sample, as represented in figure 3. These data overall indicate that the expression patterns detected by microarray analysis are in good agreement with those detected by qRT-PCR and validate our study."

Four studies with 1598 cases and 1585 controls fulfilling the predefined inclusion criteria were included in the current meta-analysis (Fig. 1).

The genotype and allele frequency of included studies were shown in Table 2. All the included cases were from five Caucasian population groups, two of which came from the Australian-based independent cohorts.

    "content": "Results\n\nClinical characterization of paradoxical psoriasis\n\nWe analyzed three patients affected by severe HS, and who developed paradoxical psoriasiform reactions following treatment with adalimumab. Patient 1, a 48‐year‐old Caucasian woman, showed nodules, fistulas and sinus tracts in the inguinal and perianal regions (Hurley III, Sartorius score: 41.5). After 3 months of therapy with anti‐TNF‐α, she developed psoriasiform eruptions (PASI 6.8), with pustular lesions and erythemato‐scaly lesions on the plantar region and lower limbs, respectively (Figure 1). A similar pattern of HS severity was observed in patient 2 (Hurley III, Sartorius score: 41.5), a 40‐year‐old Caucasian man, showing erythematous‐pustular lesions in the palmo‐plantar regions and erythemato‐scaly plaques on the legs and scalp, ascribed to psoriasiform dermatitis (PASI 5.2), arising after 2 months treatment with adalimumab (Figure 1). He concomitantly showed alopecia areata on the scalp and some eczematous‐like skin lesions. Patient 3, a 27‐year‐old Caucasian man, was affected by severe HS (Hurley III, Sartorius score: 61.5) characterized by comedones, nodules, and fistulas in the inguinal, gluteal and abdominal regions. He developed pustular lesions in the palmo‐plantar regions, and erythemato‐scaly plaques on the legs, scalp, elbows, and trunk (PASI 5.6) after 3 months of biological therapy (Figure 1). He refused to undergo a punch biopsy and, therefore, we could not perform the histological and immunological analyses. Paradoxical psoriasis regressed in all patients when adalimumab was discontinued. Interestingly, all three patients examined had a positive family history for psoriasis and, additionally, patient 1 reported other cases of HS among first‐degree relatives.\n\nHistological examination of the psoriasiform lesions of patients 1 and 2 showed epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, papillary vessel ectasia and perivascular infiltrate compatible with a psoriasiform dermatitis (Figure 1). A CD15+ neutrophilic infiltrate was abundant in the dermal compartment and present in corneal abscesses (Figures 1 and 2). Interestingly, some eczematiform spongiotic areas overlapping with the psoriasis‐like histological pattern were present in the skin lesions of patient 2.\n\nInnate immunity cells highly infiltrate paradoxical psoriasiform lesions\n\nLeukocyte subpopulations were characterized in paradoxical psoriasiform lesions, and compared to those present in classical plaque‐type psoriasis. In line with previous studies 19, 33, paradoxical psoriasis exhibited a prominent infiltrate of BDCA2+ pDCs in the dermis, significantly more abundant than in classical psoriasis (~2.7‐fold increase). In parallel, a significant increase of CD15+ neutrophils, c‐kit/CD117+ mast cells, CD68+ macrophages and monocytes in the dermis of paradoxical skin reactions was observed (~3.8‐, 3.5‐, and 1.8‐fold increase, respectively) (Figure 2). In contrast, CD3+ cells were similar and CD11c+ DCs were less abundant (~1.5 fold‐decrease) (Figure 2).\n\nWe next evaluated the local expression of psoriasis‐related cytokines, such as IL‐17A, IFN‐γ, and IL‐22, as well as IL‐36γ which is highly released by neutrophils 27. As shown in Figure 3, IFN‐γ immunoreactivity decreased in psoriasiform reactions of patients 1 and 2, as compared to classical psoriasis, whereas IL‐22 positivity was significantly augmented in the infiltrate, in particular in cells with a macrophage‐like morphology (~2.1‐fold increase). Due to the numerous neutrophils present in the dermis of paradoxical reactions, IL‐36γ positivity was also enhanced, compared to classical psoriasis. However, IL‐36γ expression in the epidermal compartment was similar (Figure 3). FACS analysis of the T‐cells isolated from skin biopsies confirmed a significant reduction of IFN‐γ+ CD3+ cells in patients 1 and 2, when compared to CD3+ cells isolated from classical psoriasis (~7‐ and 1.7‐fold decrease, respectively) (Figure 4). The reduction of IFN‐γ positivity was also observed in circulating CD3+ cells of patients 1 and 2. Similarly, TNF‐α positivity was lower in skin T‐lymphocytes of patients 1 and 2. TNF‐α positivity of circulating CD3+ cells was instead lower only in patient 1, as compared to patient 2 and patients with classical psoriasis (Figure 4). Moreover, IL‐17A positivity was comparable in patient 1 and psoriatic patients, whereas it was very high in T cells isolated from the skin of patient 2, where a mixed population of T cells, responsible for either the psoriasiform or eczematous reactions, is likely present (Figure 1). IL‐22 was similar in T cells of psoriasiform lesions and classical psoriasis, whereas it was substantially reduced in PBMCs (Figure 4). CD3+ cells from skin biopsies of HS patients were enriched in CD8+, but not in CD4+ cells, when compared to PBMC isolated from the same patients. CD3+ skin T cells of classical psoriasis showed instead an enrichment of both CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations (Figure 4).\n\nOverexpression of innate immunity molecules in paradoxical psoriasis\n\nSince we found that the inflammatory infiltrate pattern in paradoxical psoriasis strongly resembles that present in acute psoriasis, we next analyzed selected innate immunity molecules potentially involved in the triggering of psoriasis. As shown in Figure 5A, the type I IFN‐β was expressed in paradoxical skin lesions, mainly in keratinocytes, at levels significantly higher than classical psoriasis (~1.9‐fold increase). IFN‐β expression was also detected in cells with a T‐cell‐ and DC‐like morphology, as well as in endothelial cells. The epidermis of psoriasiform reactions was also immunoreactive for IFN‐κ, another keratinocyte‐derived type I IFN 34. IFN‐κ expression was similar in the two psoriasis conditions, even if it showed different subcellular localization within keratinocytes, being cytoplasmic in psoriasiform lesions and membrane‐bound in classical psoriasis (Figure 5A). IFN‐κ staining was also present in cells with a monocyte‐ or DC‐like morphology, at comparable levels in classical and nonclassical psoriasis (Figure 5A). Similarly to IFN‐β, IFN‐α2a and IFN‐λ1, but not IFN‐λ2 and IFN‐λ3, were greatly increased in paradoxical psoriasis, as compared to plaque psoriasis (Figure 5B and data not shown). Of note, LL‐37 was strongly expressed in psoriasiform skin lesions, at levels higher than classical psoriasis (Figure 5B). We finally investigated LT‐α and LT‐β, two members of the cytokine TNF family, also known as TNF‐β and TNF‐C 35, possibly deregulated by anti‐TNF‐α therapy. Both lymphotoxins were strongly overexpressed in paradoxical skin reactions, especially in keratinocytes of the basal layer epidermis.\n\nAs a whole, these data reveal the presence of an overexpressed innate immunity pattern in the skin of HS patients with paradoxical psoriasis.\n\nSNP characterization in HS patients developing paradoxical psoriasis\n\nIn order to understand whether paradoxical reactions of HS patients had a genetic basis, we analyzed a number of SNPs predisposing to psoriasis. Among them, we studied SNPs frequent in the psoriatic population, such as polymorphisms of the HLA‐C and HLA‐B regions and the ERAP1 gene. We also analyzed genetic variants of pathogenic cytokines, receptors and signal transducers (i.e. TNF‐α, IL‐17F, IL‐17RA, IL‐23R, IL‐12B, IKBζ, A20, A20 binding protein, Tyk2), and of skin‐barrier proteins (i.e. CDSN, CCHCR1) (see supplementary material, Table S1). All HS patients showed variants of ERAP1 and the HLA‐C region, either homozygosis or heterozygosis (Table 1). Three SNPs in ERAP1 (rs30187/rs30186/rs26653) and nine variants in HLA‐C (rs114395371/rs9264942/rs10484554/rs2524095/rs28383849/rs9264944/rs2853922/rs147538049/rs9264946) were, in fact, found in all patients, with SNPs distributed differently in the three patients. None of them showed the classical HLA‐Cw6 allele, even though patients 1 and 3 carried three point SNPs (rs2524095/rs2853922/rs386698994) mapping near the HLA‐Cw6 SNP position (rs17192540) (Table 1). In contrast, patient 2 mostly showed genetic polymorphisms (rs9264942/rs10484554/rs28383849/rs9264944/rs147538049/rs9264946) present in the genomic region containing a second variant of HLA‐Cw6 (Table 1). All HS patients carried SNPs in NFKBIZ (rs3217713) and TNFAIP (rs610604) genes, encoding IKBζ and A20 proteins respectively. Interestingly, patient 3 showed the higher number of psoriasis‐related SNPs, and shared a number of SNPs with patient 2 (rs7637230/rs4819554/rs3132554/rs10542126/rs3130983), and rs280519 with patient 1 (Table 1). Patient 3 also carried two other SNPs in CDSN (rs1062470/rs707913) and three SNPs in CCHCR1 (rs1576/rs130079/rs746647) (Table 1).\n\nAlthough rs11209026 in the IL23R gene has been previously associated with paradoxical psoriasiform reactions to anti‐TNFs 36, we could not find this SNP in any of the HS patients. Two other SNPs in IL23R, rs72676067, and rs1004819, were instead detected in patients 2 and 1, respectively."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nThe Structure of Human FANCL Central Domain\n\nWe have determined the structure of the predicted human DRWD domain (residues 109–294) to 2.0 Å resolution. Overall, the human FANCL central domain has a fused bilobal shape with dimensions: 70 × 25 × 20 Å, consisting of four α-helices and nine β-strands (Fig. 2A). Each lobe contains a four-stranded β-meander followed by a β-element in the N-terminal lobe and an α-helix in the C-terminal lobe. The lobes are fused by a kinked helix that runs from one lobe to the other. In addition, there is an α-helix N-terminal to the first β-meander and a C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 2B).\n\nGlobal Comparison with DmFANCL\n\nA comparison of known structures using the DALI server unsurprisingly reveals DmFANCL (PDB code 3K1L) as the closest structural homologue. However, a DALI comparison using only the N-terminal lobe (residues 109–194) or C-terminal lobe (residues 195–294) of the human central domain lists E2 UBC enzymes as the most structurally similar for both, with significant RWD fold hits only for the C-terminal lobe (Fig. 2C). This is due to the single biggest difference between the DmDRWD and the human central domain being the change of secondary structure element in the N-terminal lobe (Fig. 2D). In the DmDRWD, both lobes contain a helix after the four-stranded β-meander, indicative of an RWD fold, even in the absence of the triple turn YPXXXP motif. The human central domain, however, harbors the YPXXXP motif in the N-terminal lobe and a related HPXXXP motif in the C-terminal lobe (Fig. 3A). However, the human N-terminal lobe has a β-element in the position normally occupied by a helix in RWD folds. This puts the N-terminal lobe of the human central domain in an almost intermediary position between an E2 fold with a β-flap in the catalytic position and an α-helix in the non-catalytic RWD-like folds (Fig. 2C). Therefore the human central domain is not a DRWD but in fact a UBC-RWD domain. For the remainder of this study, the human central FANCL domain will be referred to as the UBC-RWD domain (URD). Structure-based sequence alignment with other FANCL proteins reveals that this element swap is likely to be in all the vertebrate FANCLs (Fig. 3A). Therefore we refer to this as a vertebrate-specific feature, and it represents a key difference between the vertebrate and invertebrate FANCLs.\n\nIntriguingly, the human β-element in the N-terminal lobe contains a cysteine (Fig. 3A). Superposition of the human N-terminal lobe with Ube2T, with a root mean square deviation of 2 Å, reveals that the cysteine in the URD β-element lies structurally in the same position as the catalytic cysteine of Ube2T (Fig. 2C). We wondered whether this cysteine was capable of forming a thioester bond with ubiquitin as in the case of the catalytic E2s. To test whether the cysteine in the URD is catalytic, we carried out a thioester charge assay. The thioester assay revealed that the URD is unable to form a thioester linkage between its cysteine and the activated C terminus of ubiquitin (Fig. 3B).\n\nThe interacting residues between the N- and C-terminal lobes of the URD and DmDRWD are not conserved (Fig. 3, A and C). However the residues that make up the hydrophobic core between the two lobes are highly conserved (Fig. 3A). A structural alignment of the human and Drosophila domains shows an overall conservation of 50%, with only 13% of residues absolutely conserved (Fig. 3A). There are also differences in conservation between the two lobes, with the C-terminal lobe being more conserved than the N-terminal lobe (30 and 20%, respectively).\n\nSurface Composition Reveals Extensive Hydrophobic Exposure\n\nIt is likely that differences in a core complex requirement for the vertebrate system arise from the need to stabilize FANCL. We reasoned that there would likely be differences in the surface conservation and surface chemical composition between DmFANCL and human FANCL (HsFANCL). To assess this, we generated surface maps of the URD and compared it with the DmDRWD domain (Fig. 4).\n\nThe surface conservation between DmDRWD and the URD is ∼32%. The surface is more conserved on the C-terminal lobe at 20% as compared with the N-terminal lobe at 12% (Figs. 3A and 4A).\n\nComparison of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues between the URD and the DmDRWD reveals additional surface hydrophobic residues on the URD. A small hydrophobic patch resides on the N-terminal lobe of the URD, between the last β-strand of the four-stranded β-meander (β4) and the β-element (residues Leu-149, Tyr-165, Phe-166, and Val-167, Fig. 4B). Additionally a patch on the URD lies between α-helix 1 and the N-terminal region of the large kinked helix, corresponding to residues Leu-121, Ala-140, Ile-184, Tyr-187, and Leu-191 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, a reasonably conserved region resides on the N-terminal region corresponding to residues Tyr-112, Tyr-113, and Leu-116 in DmDRWD, and more extensively in humans, Ile-115, Trp-123, Leu-126, Val-127, Tyr-128, Ala-129, and Phe-133 (Fig. 4B). On the C-terminal domain of the DmDRWD is a hydrophobic groove between the last β-strand of the four-stranded β-meander and α-helix 3 that follows (residues Ile-243, Met-246, Leu-248, Leu-264, Leu-268, and Trp-271). In the human URD, there is also a hydrophobic groove formed by residues Phe-253, Val-260, and Leu-268, but it is extended by comparison with the DmFANCL to include Leu-248, Phe-252, Leu-254, Ile-265, and Ile-271 (Fig. 4B). In the URD, there is an additional small hydrophobic patch that consists of Trp-212, Val-213, and Leu-214. In Drosophila DRWD, the corresponding residues are His-208, Val-209, and Leu-210. This patch in the Drosophila DRWD is partly occluded by the DRWD-RING loop in the full-length FANCL structure.\n\nA comparison of the electrostatic potential of the surfaces of the URD and the DmDRWD reveals distinct differences between the species (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, there is a large positive patch on the DmDRWD, which is absent in the URD. Overall, the URD has a greater negative charge then the DmDRWD, which wraps around the URD like a ring. However, on the backside of the central FANCL domain in both human and Drosophila, there is a similar overall negative charge.\n\nThe Human RING Domain Binds Ube2T\n\nTo assess whether the URD plays any role in Ube2T binding, we carried out size-exclusion chromatography and ITC. Initial results from the size-exclusion chromatography showed no change in migration that would correspond to a complex formation between the URD and Ube2T (Fig. 5A). To further assess the interaction, we employed ITC, which again showed no interaction between the URD and Ube2T (Fig. 5B). We then tested the purified RING domain to see whether it was sufficient for Ube2T binding. We initially observed a 1:1 stoichiometric interaction between the RING and Ube2T as judged by the migration of the complex during size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5A). To ascertain the affinity of RING for Ube2T, we carried out ITC. After titration of Ube2T into RING, the data were fitted with a stoichiometry of 1:1 as seen in the size-exclusion chromatography, resulting in an equilibrium binding dissociation constant (Kd) of 454 nm (Fig. 5B). Based on the structure of UbcH7 bound to the RING E3 c-cbl, we mutated Phe-63 in Ube2T, predicted to be interacting with the RING, to alanine. No complex shift was observed between Ube2T-F63A and RING using analytical gel filtration (Fig. 5A). Further analysis using ITC revealed that mutant Ube2T-F63A was able to bind the RING domain, but with an 11-fold decrease in binding affinity (Kd = 5 μm, Fig. 5B).\n\nThe Human Central Domain Binds FANCI and FANCD2\n\nIn the Drosophila system, pulldown studies indicated that the ELF domain was not required for substrate binding. Given the role of the RING domain in E2 binding, we hypothesized that the URD domain would be sufficient for substrate binding. To test this, we performed in vitro pulldown experiments with FANCI, FANCD2, and the URD (Fig. 6). As expected, the URD was pulled down by both substrates. Our structural analysis reveals several hydrophobic patches exposed on the surface of the URD (Fig. 4B). To establish which patch(es) may be required for substrate binding, we generated the following mutants: L149A/F166A; L248A/F252A/L254A/I265A; V127A/Y128A; and W212A/L214A (Fig. 6A). All mutants were purified to homogeneity as wild type URD and subjected to pulldown arrays with FANCI and FANCD2. Both substrates showed reduced binding with mutants L248A/F252A/L254A/I265A and W212A/L214A as compared with wild type, indicating that the exposed hydrophobic patches on the C-terminal lobe are required for substrate binding. In contrast, mutations in the patches on the N-terminal lobe behaved as wild type (Fig. 6B)."

    "content": "Results and Discussion\n\nOverall structure of FAAP20-UBZ in complex with K63-linked Ub2 \n\nFAAP20 is a 20 kDa protein, which binds to FANCA through its N-terminal region and contains a conserved UBZ domain in its C terminal extremity. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the specific interaction between FAAP20-UBZ and Ub chains, we determined the crystal structure of FAAP20-UBZ (residues 143–180) in complex with K63-linked Ub2 (K63-Ub2) at 1.9 Å resolution (S1 Table). Unlike other UBZ structures determined so far, FAAP20-UBZ lacks the two short β strands found in the classical ββα-fold (Fig. 1). The central α-helix (residues 160–173) is flanked between two loops (residues 143–159 and 174–180, respectively). A zinc ion is coordinated by the conserved residues Cys147, Cys150, His166 and Cys170 and bridges the first loop and the α-helix. Both the α-helix and the second loop interact with the distal Ub of K63-Ub2. In contrast, the proximal Ub does not interact with FAAP20 but contact two distinct neighboring proximal ubiquitins in the crystal through their Ile44 patches (S1 Fig.). Lys63 of one distal ubiquitin could not be linked to Gly76 of its neighboring ubiquitins. The distances between Leu71 of one distal ubiquitin and Lys63 of its neighboring ubiquitins are 34.0 Å and 34.8 Å, which are much longer than the length of the flexible C-terminal region of ubiquitin (Leu71-Gly76) that links two ubiquitins (16.4 Å). Consequently, FAAP20-UBZ interacts with one Ub moiety of K63-Ub2 in the present structure of the FAAP20-UBZ•K63-Ub2 complex, suggesting that FAAP20-UBZ can bind Ub as well as K63 and other chains.\n\nTo assess this possibility, we measured the affinity of FAAP20-UBZ with Ub or K63-, K48- or M1-linked Ub2 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy (Table 1 and S2 Fig.). FAAP20-UBZ binds Ub efficiently (K d = 19.9 μM). The equilibrium dissociation constant is lower than those of other UBDs. In particular, the binding affinity of FAAP20-UBZ for Ub seems higher than that of the Polη UBZ (K d = 81 μM, measured by isothermal titration calorimetry). The equilibrium dissociation constants of FAAP20-UBZ for the Ub2 species are either equivalent (M1) or twice higher (K63 and K48) than that for Ub. Therefore, FAAP20-UBZ can bind Ub and has little linkage specificity towards M1-, K48- and K63-linked Ub2 species. In the FAAP20-UBZ•K63-Ub2 structure, one FAAP20-UBZ molecule interacts with one K63-Ub2 molecule. This 1:1 stoichiometry may be an artifact of crystallization, because, in our SPR experiment, the actual R max for binding of FAAP20-UBZ to K63-Ub2 is 30.0 ± 2.2 resonance units (RU), which is significantly higher than the theoretical R max calculated from a 1:1 stoichiometry model (18.8 ± 0.4 RU) and slightly lower than that from a 2:1 (UBZ:Ub2) model (37.6 ± 0.9 RU). Therefore, two FAAP20-UBZ molecules can simultaneously bind the two Ub moieties of K63-Ub2 in solution.\n\nIn addition, we tested the interaction of FAAP20 with K63-, K48- or M1-linked Ub2 by GST-pulldown assay. As shown in S3 Fig., both the full-length FAAP20 (1–180) and FAAP20-UBZ (142–180) can similarly bind these three different diubiquitin chains. Altogether our data indicate that FAAP20 does not display any Ub chain specificity in apparent contradiction with two previous publications, which suggested that FAAP20-UBZ preferentially binds K63 chains over K48 chains. Both relied on GST-pull down experiments, where the input ubiquitin chains had different length between K63 and K48-linked chains. In contrast, pull-down experiments using K63 and K48 chains of similar length did not show any difference, consistent with our data. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other subunit(s) in the FA core complex might confer K63 specificity to FAAP20-UBZ. FANCA could be the candidate, because it directly binds to FAAP20.\n\nInteractions between FAAP20-UBZ and Ub\n\nBoth hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds constitute the interaction between FAAP20-UBZ and Ub. At the UBZ α helix, the side chains of Leu161, Leu167, Ala168, Leu171 and Ala172 and the aliphatic portion of Asp164 hydrophobically interact with the canonical Ile44-centered hydrophobic patch of Ub, which is formed by the side chains of Leu8, Ile44 and Val70 and the aliphatic portions of Thr66 and His68 side chains (Fig. 2A). The Asp164 Oδ atoms of FAAP20-UBZ further hydrogen bond with the main-chain amide groups of Ala46 and Gly47 of Ub, respectively. Trp180, which is located at the C-terminal extremity of the second loop of FAAP20-UBZ, also participates in the hydrophobic interaction with Ile44 of Ub. In addition, its Nε atom hydrogen bonds with the main-chain CO group of Gly47 of Ub (Fig. 2B). At the C-terminal part of the UBZ α-helix, the main-chain CO group of Leu171 hydrogen bonds with the Nη atom of Ub Arg72. The following second loop of FAAP20-UBZ also interacts with Arg72 of Ub. The main-chain CO groups of Ser174 and Thr175 in FAAP20-UBZ hydrogen bond with the two Nη atoms of Arg72 in Ub, respectively. Moreover, the two Oδ atoms of Asp177 on the second loop hydrogen bond with Nε and Nη of Arg42 in Ub, respectively, and the main-chain CO group of Val178 hydrogen bonds with Nε of Gln49 in Ub.\n\nContribution of these intermolecular interactions to Ub binding was examined by SPR analysis of site-directed FAAP20-UBZ mutants (Table 2 and S4 Fig.). No binding could be measured with mutations D164A, A168L and W180A, similarly to a mutation of a zinc-coordinating residue Cys150, which disables the bridging between the first loop and the central α-helix and thus likely destabilizes the FAAP20-UBZ structure. These results indicate that the central core interactions are essential for Ub binding. On the other hand, binding of L161A, A172L and D177A mutants was significantly reduced but could be measured. L161A, A172L and D177A mutations decreased the affinities 6.3-, 5.7- and 10.9-fold, respectively. Therefore, Ub binding of FAAP20-UBZ relies primarily on the central core interactions, which is enhanced by their surrounding interactions.\n\nIn vivo accumulation of FAAP20 to ICL sites, depending on the UBZ–Ub interaction\n\nAfter ICL formation, FAAP20 is recruited to DNA damage sites. This localization requires a functional UBZ domain. We tested if FAAP20 proteins bearing the aforementioned mutations were still able to localize to ICL sites. We generated ICLs by irradiating cells with UVA after pre-incubation with psoralen and monitored accumulation of GFP-tagged FAAP20 to DNA damage sites by confocal imaging (Fig. 3). Wild-type FAAP20 was accumulated to ICL sites 10 minutes after psoralen-UVA treatment, as shown in previous studies. In contrast, C150S, D164A, A168L and W180A mutants adopted a diffuse localization throughout the cells. Therefore, the residues that are essential for Ub binding in vitro are also required for proper recruitment of FAAP20 to DNA damage sites in vivo. These results also ensure that binding between FAAP20-UBZ and Ub is physiologically essential for the recruitment of FAAP20 to DNA damage sites.\n\nComparison of FAAP20-UBZ with WRNIP1-, RAD18-, Polη- and NEMO-UBZ\n\nThe Ub-interacting residues of FAAP20-UBZ are conserved or replaced by functionally equivalent residues among human, mouse, rat, chicken and puffy fish (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, we could not assess the conservation of these residues among other UBZs, due to their highly divergent amino-acid sequences. Three-dimensional structural information is required to correctly align their sequences.\n\nTo date, UBZ structures of WRNIP1 and RAD18 have been solved in complex with Ub. The Ub-interacting residues are conserved between both proteins. WRNIP1-UBZ (PDB code: 3VHT) and RAD18-UBZ (PDB code: 2MRE) display the canonical ββα fold, in which the loop between both antiparallel β-strands (β-loop) and the α-helix interact with Ub. As shown in Fig. 4B, the central α-helix of WRNIP1 occupies a position similar to the C-terminal loop of FAAP20. Arg42 of Ub interacts with Asp37 in the α-helix of WRNIP1 and Asp177 in the C-terminal loop of FAAP20. Similarly, the β-loop of WRNIP1 occupies a part of the FAAP20 α-helix position. In particular, Ile44 of Ub interacts with Pro21 and Val22 in the β-loop, in place of Ala168 and Leu167 in the α-helix of FAAP20.\n\nNext, we analyzed other members of the UBZ family. UBZ structures of Polη and NEMO (Polη- and NEMO-UBZ, respectively) have been solved in isolated forms. Both NEMO-UBZ (PDB code: 2JVX) and Polη-UBZ (PDB code: 2I5O) seem to interact with Ub in a manner different from RAD18-UBZ and WRNIP1-UBZ. The highly conserved Pro21-Val22 in the β-loop of WRNIP1 are replaced by Pro398-Lys399 in NEMO-UBZ and Glu636-Lys637 in Polη (Fig. 4A). The presence of charged residues should disrupt the hydrophobic interaction with Ile44. In contrast, four Ub-interacting residues of FAAP20-UBZ (i.e., Asp164, Leu167, Ala168 and Leu171) are conserved or replaced by a functionally equivalent residue in Polη-UBZ (i.e., Asp652, Phe655, Ala656 and Leu659) (Fig. 4A and S5 Fig.). This sequence conservation suggests that Polη-UBZ binds Ub in a similar manner to FAAP20-UBZ. On the other hand, these residues are poorly conserved in NEMO-UBZ, where Asp164, Leu167, Ala168 and Leu171 of FAAP20-UBZ are replaced by Gln411, Val414, Met415 and Ile418, respectively. Importantly, the side chain of Met415 of NEMO-UBZ is much larger than that of Ala168 of FAAP20-UBZ and thus cannot fit in the Ile44-centered hydrophobic patch of Ub, suggesting a different mode of interaction with Ub (Fig. 4 and S5 Fig.). The alanine residue corresponding to Ala168 of FAAP20-UBZ seems also missing in other UBZs including WRNIP1 and RAD18 (Fig. 5).\n\nAltogether, our data suggest the presence of at least three groups of UBZ domains (Fig. 5). In the FAAP20/Polη group, the β-loop is absent or too divergent, so that Ile44 interacts with hydrophobic residues in the α-helix. The WRNIP1/Rad18 group interacts with Ile44 of Ub through their β-loop. Finally, the third group of UBZ domains comprises proteins that possess neither the FAAP20-UBZ residues involved in Ub-binding (highlighted in red) nor the RAD18-UBZ residues involved in Ub-binding (highlighted in black), and their mode of interaction should be different from the two other groups. The UBZ domains have been classified, according to the zinc coordinating residues (namely type 3 for CCHH and type 4 for CCHC). However, this classification seems not appropriate for representing the structural information, since several type-3 UBZs interact differently with Ub (NEMO-UBZ, FAAP20-UBZ and WRNIP1-UBZ).\n\nComparison of FAAP20-UBZ with other UBDs\n\nTo further investigate whether the UBZ-Ub interface resembles other UBD-Ub interface, we compared the Ub-interacting α-helix of FAAP20-UBZ with Ub-binding single α-helix motifs such as UIM (Ub-interacting motif) and MIU (motif interacting with Ub, also known as IUIM [inverted UIM]) (Fig. 6). Three-dimensional structures of the UIM domain of Vps27 (Vps27-UIM) (PDB code: 1Q0W) and the MIU domain of Rabex5 (Rabex5-MIU) (PDB code: 2C7M and 2FIF) have been solved in complex with Ub. Rabex5-MIU and FAAP20-UBZ are orientated in the same direction, relative to the bound Ub. Remarkably, critical residues involved in Ub binding are strictly identical between Rabex5-MIU and FAAP20-UBZ. Thus, the α-helix-mediated Ub-interaction of FAAP20-UBZ is closely related to that of MIU. Although the UIM polarity towards the bound Ub is opposite to FAAP20-UBZ and Rabex5-MIU, most of the Ub-interacting residues on the α-helix are identical or functionally equivalent among Vps27-UIM, FAAP20-UBZ and Rabex5-MIU, suggesting convergent evolution of these three distinct Ub-binding motifs."

    "content": "Results\n\nClinical analysis\n\nThe present study included a total of 101 CD patients (45 males and 56 females), and the 103 healthy controls (43 males and 60 females). The mean age of patients was found to be 28.8 ± 13.9 years and for controls it was 31.6 ± 8.8 years. Of the study participants, 30% of the patients and 50% of the controls were born to consanguineous parents. The common clinical symptoms seen in CD patients were as follows: chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia and abdominal distension. The common autoimmune manifestations seen in our patient group were type 1 diabetes mellitus (32%), autoimmune thyroiditis (8%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (3%). We also observed few non-autoimmune disease manifestations like osteomalacia (5%), seizure disorders (4%), and Down syndrome (4%).\n\nReal time PCR genotyping results\n\nHLA tagSNPs- allelic frequency distribution analysis\n\nIn Table 3, of the 4 HLA-tag SNPs tested, only three (rs2395182, rs7775228, and rs2187668) have shown the significant difference in minor allele frequency distribution among CD patients in comparison with healthy controls. Our statistical results for rs2395182 have indicated that the minor ‘G’ allele is more prevalent in healthy controls (18%) than in CD group (10%) [P=0.015, OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.138–3.562]. For rs7775228 SNP, significant differences in the frequency of minor ‘C’ allele among controls (21%) and CD patients (14%) was observed [P=0.0497; OR = 1.67; 95% CI = 0.998–2.787]. Interestingly, for the rs2187668, 10% of CD group were found to be carrying the minor ‘T’ allele compared with the 3% of the healthy controls. This difference in minor allelic frequency is statistically significant [P=0.001; OR = 4.074; 95% CI = 1.615–10.273]. For rs7454108, there was no statistically significant difference between case and control groups (P-value > 0.5).\n\nHLA-DQ haplotype results\n\nThe risk classification of the HLA-DQ genotypes (Table 4) is based on previous study from Saudi Arabia. In our study, tag SNP predicted homozygous HLA-DQ2.5 haplotype is significantly high in CD patients compared to healthy controls (10.89 vs 2.91%; p = 0.024). No heterozygous DQ2.5 (in combination with DQ8 or DQ2.2) carriers were predicted by the tag SNP combinations in either patient or control groups. The DQ8 heterozygous haplotypes (DQ8/DQ2.2 and DQ8/DQX) were highly frequent among CD patients (33.66%) with significant difference in DQ8/DQX haplotype between patients and control group, (32.67% vs 14.56% respectively, p = 0.014). Surprisingly, the homozygous DQ8 high risk haplotype was predicted by the tag SNPs more frequently in control groups (7.76%) than in patients (1.98%). However, the difference was not statistically significant. The predicted homozygous HLA-DQ2.2 haplotype was also frequent in control (5.82%) group than in CD patients (0.99%). A total of 29.13% controls and 24.75% CD patients were heterozygous for DQ2.2. A total of 74 (36.27%) individuals predicted to be lacking all the high risk HLA alleles and seen as the extremely low risk group (DQX).\n\nValidation by sanger sequencing results\n\nThe sequencing analysis with sanger method showed the accuracy (100%) of Real-time PCR based tagSNPs approach in determining the HLA-DQ haplotype among randomly selected individuals for each SNP genotypes from both study groups (Figure 2)."

    "content": "Results\n\nStudy population\n\nBetween January 2009 and December 2011 (pre-specified period of 2 years), we recruited 322 ovarian cancer patients treated with 3–6 cycles paclitaxel-carboplatin combination therapy (n = 266) or 3–6 cycles carboplatin mono-therapy (n = 56) (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Of all recruited patients, 99% was Caucasian (Table 2). Hematological toxicity was analyzed in 290 patients, after exclusion of patients for which weekly blood examinations were not available (n = 32). For neurotoxicity, 56 patients treated with carboplatin monotherapy were excluded since the incidence of sensory neuropathy was significantly lower in this population (p < 0.001). One patient with pre-existing sensory neuropathy before start of chemotherapy was additionally excluded, bringing the total number of patients eligible up to 265. For the secondary objectives, PFI and OS, all patients treated with paclitaxel-carboplatin (n = 266) were included. Patient, disease and toxicity characteristics are summarized in Table 2. Briefly, grade 3–4 anemia was present in 57 patients (19.7%), grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia in 57 patients (19.7%), grade 4 neutropenia in 202 patients (69.7%), whereas only 23 patients (7.9%) presented with grade 3–4 febrile neutropenia. In the group of patients selected for neurotoxicity analysis, 48 patients (18.1%) developed grade 2–3 sensory and none motor neuropathy following combination treatment with paclitaxel-carboplatin. Minor allele frequencies (MAF) were similar to those reported previously in Caucasians and adhered to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Allele frequencies of all genotyped SNPs are shown in Additional file 2: Table S1.\n\nAssociation with anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and sensory neuropathy\n\nAmong the 290 patients eligible for the hematological toxicity analysis, we observed significant associations for 5 variants (Table 3). In particular, rs1128503 (ABCB1, C > T), rs12762549 (ABCC2, C > G), rs363717 (ABCA1, A > G) and rs11615 (ERCC1, T > C) were significantly associated with grade 3–4 anemia (p = 0.035, OR 1.58; p = 0.005, OR 0.55; p = 0.001, OR 1.31 and p = 0.024, OR = 1.58). After correction for relevant covariates (as explained in the statistical methods), these variants were still significantly associated with toxicity (p = 0.023, OR 1.71; p = 0.004, OR 0.51; p = 0.002, OR 2.08; and p = 0.031, OR 1.61 respectively). Another variant rs4986910 (CYP3A4, T > C) correlated with thrombocytopenia grade 3–4, before and after correction for relevant covariates (p = 0.012, OR 5.61 and p = 0.025, OR 4.99 respectively; Table 3). When correlating each of the variants with grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, we did not observe a significant association. Finally, we also correlated each of the variants to sensory neuropathy in the population that was eligible for neurotoxicity analyses, but failed to identify significant associations. None of the observed associations with hematologic toxicity survived correction for multiple testing.\n\nAssociation between genetic variants and use of growth factors\n\nThe use of ESAs or CSFs was also correlated with each of the 26 variants to examine whether they could predict the need for an ESA or CSF during treatment with chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. After correction for relevant covariates, a significant correlation for rs2074087 (ABCC1, G > C) and the use of ESA was noticed (p = 0.011, OR 2.09, Table 4). After correction for covariates, CSF use was significantly correlated with rs2073337 (ABCC2, A > G), rs1695 (GSTP1, A > G) and rs1799793 (ERCC2, G > A) (p = 0.039, OR 0.60; p = 0.017, OR 0.55; and p = 0.042, OR 0.63 respectively). None of the observed associations with use of growth factors survived correction for multiple testing.\n\nEffects of variants on PFI and OS\n\nThe median follow-up of all patients participating to the study was 2.5 years (95% CI = 2.2-2.8 years) with 157 events for progression (59%) and 84 events for OS (31.6%). Uncorrected P-values were calculated using Cox regression analysis either adjusted for age at diagnosis only or fully adjusted for age at diagnosis, FIGO stage, tumor grade, tumor histology and residual disease after debulking surgery. Only one variant, rs1799793 (ERCC2 G > A), was significantly correlated with PFI in both cases (p = 0.003, HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.57-0.89, p = 0.016, HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.60-0.95). In particular, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant advantage in PFI for GG carriers of rs1799793 compared to AA or GA carriers (p = 0.016; Figure 1). Variants rs12762549 (ABCC2 A > G) and rs6104 (SERPINB2 C > G) were significantly associated with PFI in the fully-adjusted model (p = 0.037 and p = 0.040, respectively), but these associations were not statistically significant in model adjusted for age only (p = 0.402 and p = 0.219, respectively). No significant correlations were found for OS.\n\nNone of the observed associations with platinum-free interval survived correction for multiple testing."

    "content": "Results\n\nGenetic results (Table 2, Figs. 1 and 2)\n\nSNP array of I1 showed a de novo 6.4 Mb deletion on chromosome 3 (chr3:121233326–127618464) containing more than 40 RefSeq genes, including UMPS, making it likely to be contributing to the patient’s phenotype. It did not contain any genes known to cause agenesis of the corpus callosum when deleted. In four individuals (I4, I7, I10, I11) and four healthy family members (M7, S7, M10, F11), three different heterozygous alterations UMPS were found which were predicted to lead to a premature stop and thereby loss of normal protein function via protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In I4 c.302delA (p.Lys101Argfs*9) was found; karyotyping, SNP array, and gene-specific deletion/duplication testing of UMPS via high-density gene-centric array CGH did not reveal abnormalities. No family members were tested. I7 harbored the c.385G>T (p.Gly129*) variant in UMPS, which was maternally inherited and also found in the healthy brother (S7). In both I10 and I11 (coming from the same region of the Netherlands), a c.889G>T (p.Glu297*) variant was found (maternally inherited in I10; paternally in I11). In six individuals (I3, I5, I6, I8, I9, I12) and 16 healthy family members (M3, M5, M6, M7, n = 12 from pedigree 2) seven different heterozygous missense alterations were detected. In pedigree 2, 12 family members (Fig. 1) tested positive for the c.224C>A (p.Pro75His) variant. In five cases the variant was derived maternally, in four cases paternally and in three cases it is unknown. In I3 and his healthy mother M3 (7,13) two variants c.286A>G (p.Arg96Gly) and c.1285G>C (p.Gly429Arg) in UMPS were found, therefore likely to be on the same allele. In I5 the variant c.310G>A (Gly104Arg) was detected, I6 harbored c.689G>A (p.Arg230His), in I7 c.688C>T (p.Arg230Cys) was found, both were maternally inherited. In I9 c.857T>A (p.Ile286Asn) and in I11 c.451G>A (p.Val151Met) were detected; both parents were not tested. The missense alterations found were predicted to be pathogenic by different software programs (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutationTaster). All amino acids affected were well-conserved from H. sapiens (down) to D. melanogaster or to C. elegans. I6 was also heterozygous for a second maternally inherited undocumented variant, c.360A>G (p.Leu120Leu), a synonymous change. In individuals 4, 6, and 7, additionally copy number variations in UMPS were excluded. Most of the variants were not listed in the Exac browser; for those listed, the allele frequencies were below 0.001 (Table 2).\n\nMolecular modeling of UMPS variants\n\nThe effects of missense mutations in the UMPS gene on the protein conformation are illustrated in Fig. 2 and described in the legend of the figure."

The genotype and allele frequencies in the patient and control groups were calculated separately, and the strength of association was assessed by estimating the OR with 95% Cl.\n\nAll SNPs obeyed the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (p>0.05) except for the TGF-ß1 (rs1800469 C/T) SNP (p=0.01). This may be due to the limited population of subjects with the study (Riyadh city only).\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of patients and control participating in this study are reported in Table 1. The mean age of the CRC patient was 55.90±1.56 years and that of the control was 55.20±1.42 years. The patient and the control groups were matched for gender and BMI (p>0.05).\n\nInterleukin-8 gene (rs4073 T/A) polymorphism\n\nThe rs4073 T/A polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-8 gene was assayed in samples from patients with CRC and controls. Table 2 presents the base pairs in the wild type homozygous (TT), heterozygous (TA), and homozygous for the variant (AA). Overall, distributions of the various alleles of IL-8 (rs4073) T/A did not differ significantly between patients with CRC and controls. The majority of patients and controls were with heterozygous variant genotype (TA). The p-value was >0.05 for all genotypes and alleles.\n\nInterleukin-10 gene (rs1800896 A/G) polymorphism\n\nFor rs1800896 A/G polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene in.

We observed that the heterozygous AG was significantly decreased among patients with CRC (p=0.027) and this was confirmed by an OR=0.44. When considering the recessive model (AG+GG versus AA), we found significant association between AA genotype and risk of CRC (p=0.025, OR=0.45).\n\nInterleukin-22 gene (rs1179251 C/G and rs2227485 C/T) polymorphisms\n\nTwo IL-22 polymorphisms were studied in Saudi patients with CRC and compared to the controls in Table 4.

The results indicate the associated risk of IL-22 (rs1179251 C/G) genotypes with CRC susceptibility in this population. Allele frequency showed significant decreased of the G allele to CC with p=0.022, and this was also confirmed by an OR of 0.47. Having one or more copy of allele (G) conferred an decrease in CRC risk (p=0.062, OR=0.13). The homozygous for the variant GG was decreased among patients with CRC (OR=0.06) but did not reach significance.\n\nThe IL-22 (rs2227485: C/T) polymorphism in the promoter region was assessed. The base sequence identified in this region in the wild type homozygous (CC), heterozygous (CT), and homozygous for the variant (TT). We did not found significant association between rs2227485 C/T SNPs of IL-22 and the risk of developing CRC in the overall investigated Saudi population. In addition, the genotype and allelic frequencies were similar for the entire investigated population.\n\nInterleukin-27 gene (rs17855750T/G) polymorphism\n\nThe frequencies of the IL-27 (rs17855750 T/G) promoter SNP were analyzed. These results are summarized in Table 5. The majority of patients and controls were homozygous for the variant type allele (GG). However, a slightly association between IL-27 (rs17855750 T/G) genotypes and risk of developing CRC was observed as a decrease in the GG genotype was observed in the CRC group (85.7% vs. 95.7%, OR=0.09). A significant association between the G allele protective effect against CRC is observed (OR=0.20, p=0.005).\n\nTransforming growth factor-ß1 gene (rs1800469 C/T) polymorphism\n\nThe TGFß1 (rs1800469 C/T) polymorphism in the promoter region was assayed.Table 6 shows the genotype and allele frequency of the C and T alleles in patients and controls. It presents the SNP profile in the wild type homozygous (CC), heterozygous (CT), and mutated homozygous (TT) types. Clear tendency for a decrease in the CT genotype was observed in the CRC group (45.7% vs. 54.3%, OR=0.15, p=0.009). The TT genotype was significantly decreased in the patients (OR= 0.16, p=0.014). When considering the recessive model (CT + TT versus CC), high significant association was observed between CC genotype and occurrence of CRC (p=0.009). T allele was slightly lower in the CRC patients compared to the control group but failed to reach significance (p=0.161, OR=0.68)."

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. A majority of the cases and controls were women and were never-smokers. The average age of the cases was slightly but significantly higher than that of the control group (40.1 vs. 36.1, p = 0.0015) and the average BMI of the cases was significantly higher than the control group (29.9 vs. 27.2, p<0.0001). The self-reported race/ethnicity also differed between cases and controls (p = 0.01). Consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, lung function differed significantly between cases and controls, with reduced % of predicted FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC in cases compared to controls. Cases had a significantly higher total IgE and more cases were atopic.\n\nPopulation stratification\n\nThe first and second principal components from the PCA using 213 AIMs were plotted in Figure 1 with self-reported race/ethnicity information. The first principal component scores showed good separation between the self-reported non-Hispanic white group and the self-reported non-Hispanic black group, while the principal component scores of self-reported Hispanic group were in-between. The first five principal components counted for more than 80% of variability of the ancestry markers. The STRUCTURE method estimates the posterior probability that each subject belongs to each underlying population for each individual. When included as covariates to adjust population stratification in the association tests, the STRUCTURE method resulted in similar results to the PCA method and thus the STRUCTURE results are not reported.\n\nTSLP and asthma susceptibility\n\nThe results of association analysis of asthma and TSLP SNPs are summarized in Table 2. One SNP (rs1898671) was nominally associated with asthma susceptibility in the overall population after adjusting for covariates and population stratification (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.09–2.05, p = 0.01). However, the risk of asthma was increased for this SNP when analyzed in the subgroup of ex-smokers, (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.04–30.83, p = 0.04). In the subgroup of never-smokers, SNP rs1898671 did not show significant association with the risk of asthma (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.93–1.94, p = 0.11).\n\nBecause of the suggestion of an association of SNP rs1898671 with asthma, we examined whether the association of this SNP with asthma susceptibility could be replicated in the APCAT cohorts that combined 6 cohorts with 1716 asthma cases and 16888 controls. Analysis of this large cohort revealed consistent results with a positive association between rs1898671 and asthma (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07–1.23, p = 0.0003). When stratified by smoking history, the replication cohort validated the finding in the NYU cohort that the SNP affected risk in ex-smokers (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08–1.34, p = 0.003), whereas no significant association was found in never-smokers.\n\nTSLP haplotype analysis\n\nReconstructed haplotypes with estimated frequencies of greater than 5% are listed in Table 3 and the estimated haplotype-specific OR with respect to the reference haplotype group (defined as the group with highest frequency) and p-values are also reported. The second most frequent haplotype (GAGGGCAAAG) had an estimated frequency of 24% and showed a significant increased risk with asthma after adjusting age, BMI and population stratification (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.10–2.27, p = 0.01)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nPTPN2/22 SNP allele frequency in CD\n\nAllele frequency of the nine SNPs examined in PTPN2/22 found in both CD subjects and healthy controls are shown in Figure 2. All genotyped samples were found in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Out of the four SNPs found in PTPN2 (rs1893217, rs2542151, rs7234029, and rs478582), rs478582 was significant in the CD, where heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles when examined together were detected in 57/69 (82.6%) in CD compared to 36/59 (61.0%) healthy controls (OR = 3.03, 95%CI: 1.35-6.84, P-values < 0.05, Figure 2A). Specifically, the heterozygous (TC) alleles were detected in 38/69 (55.1%) CD compared to the 28/59 (47.5%) of healthy controls, while homozygous (CC) alleles were detected in 19/69 (27.5%) CD compared to 8/59 (13.6%) healthy controls. SNPs rs1893217, rs2542151, and rs7234029 were found to be not significant in CD compared to the healthy controls. Out of the five SNPs specific to PTPN22 (rs2476601, rs2488457, rs33996649, rs34209542, and rs2476599), none of SNPs were considered significant in CD compared to the healthy controls (Figure 2B). However, since PTPN22:rs2476601 is found significantly in various inflammatory autoimmune diseases, we continued to investigate the SNP in more detail along with PTPN2:rs478582. For PTPN22:rs2476601, CD with either heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles were detected in 11/70 (15.7%) subjects, while 4/62 (6.45%) was detected in healthy controls (OR = 2.7, 95%CI: 0.81-8.98, P-values > 0.05). Specifically, the heterozygous (GA) alleles were detected in 10/70 (14.3%) CD compared to the 4/62 (6.45%) of healthy controls, while homozygous (AA) alleles were rare in all samples.\n\nFor confirmation that CD subjects were significant in having SNP alleles for PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601, determination of haplotype combinations were done (Figure 2C). Examination of the following haplotype combinations between PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 were examined: T-G, C-G, T-A, and C-A. The T-G haplotype (major/major) was found more significantly in the healthy controls (21/59 = 35.6%) than in CD (10/69 = 14.5%, P-values < 0.05). The C-G haplotype (heterozygous or minor/major) and the C-A (heterozygous or minor/heterozygous or minor) were found more in CD (48/69 = 69.6%; 9/69 = 13.0%, respectively) than in healthy controls (34/59 = 57.6%; 2/59 = 3.39%, respectively). The C-A haplotype was found more significantly in CD than the healthy controls (P-values < 0.05).\n\nRelationship of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on expression of PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ in CD\n\nThe average relative gene expression (2(-∆CT) × 1000) of PTPN2, regardless of SNPs, in CD was significantly lower (5.27 ± 2.68, n = 38) than in healthy controls (10.5 ± 6.95, n = 30, P-values < 0.05, Figure 3A). Similarly, the average relative gene expression of PTPN22, regardless of SNPs, was also significantly lower in CD (1.76 ± 1.12, n = 38) than in healthy controls (3.24 ± 1.84, n = 30, P-values < 0.05, Figure 3B). The evaluation of the effect of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on expression of PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ was determined.\n\nFor subjects with either heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582, regardless of disease, expression of PTPN2 did not change when compared to the normal (TT) subjects. However, when examining the CD and healthy control subjects in each allele group, CD overall had a lower average relative gene expression of PTPN2. The average relative gene expression in CD with heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582 was significantly lower (5.34 ± 2.77, n = 31) compared to 10.2 ± 7.15 (n = 21) in healthy controls with similar SNPs (P-values < 0.05). Specifically, when examining subjects with heterozygous (TC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582, CD average relative gene expression was 5.22 ± 2.57 (n = 22), which was significantly lower than the healthy controls with heterozygous (TC) alleles (10.5 ± 7.15, n = 17, P-values < 0.05). When examining subjects with homozygous (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582, CD average relative gene expression was 5.64 ± 3.37 (n = 9), which was lower than the healthy controls with homozygous (CC) alleles (8.89 ± 8.03, n = 4).\n\nFor subjects with either heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601, regardless of disease, expression of PTPN22 did not change when compared to the normal (GG) subjects. However, when examining the CD and healthy control subjects in each allele group, CD overall had a lower average relative gene expression of PTPN22. The average relative gene expression in CD with heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601 was significantly lower (1.58 ± 0.93, n = 6) compared to 3.40 ± 1.19 (n = 4) in healthy controls with similar SNPs (P-values < 0.05). Specifically, when examining subjects with heterozygous (GA) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601, CD average relative gene expression was 1.48 ± 1.00 (n = 5), which was significantly lower than the healthy controls with heterozygous (GA) alleles (3.40 ± 1.19, n = 4, P < 0.05). Minor (AA) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601 was rare in all subjects.\n\nCorrelation analyses were performed to determine if expression of relative gene expression of IFN-γ changed in subjects with PTPN2:rs478582 or PTPN22:rs2476601 (Figure 3C and 3D, respectively). The average relative gene expression of IFN-γ in CD subjects with the PTPN2:rs478582 heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) allele was 0.41 ± 0.31 (n = 38), which was significantly higher compared to the CD subjects with normal (TT) alleles (0.21 ± 0.22, n = 12, P < 0.05). Specifically, CD subjects with the heterozygous (TC) allele had significantly higher (0.41 ± 0.31, n = 24, P < 0.05) IFN-γ relative gene expression than CD subjects with normal (TT) alleles, while CD subjects with the minor (CC) alleles had higher gene expression as well (0.40 ± 0.31, n = 14). There was no significant change in IFN-γ relative gene expression in the CD subjects with the PTPN22:rs2476601 heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles. However, in healthy controls, subjects with the heterozygous (GA) or minor (AA) alleles had a significantly higher gene expression (0.67 ± 0.28, n = 4, P < 0.05) than healthy controls with normal (GG) alleles (0.40 ± 0.21, n = 20).\n\nEffect of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on susceptibility of MAP infection in CD\n\nOverall detection of MAP IS900 DNA was found in CD and healthy control subjects and were correlated with PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 (Table 2). Out of 70 CD subjects, 43 (61.4%) were positive for MAPbacteremia compared to only 4/48 (9.33%) of healthy controls (P < 0.05, OR = 17.5, 95%CI: 5.65-54.3).\n\nCorrelation analyses with PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 along with MAP infection was done on CD and healthy controls to see if these SNPs increase MAP susceptibility (Table 2). For CD subjects with heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582, 34/56 (60.7%) had MAPbacteremia presence compared to only 2/30 (6.67%) in healthy controls with similar SNPs (P < 0.05, OR = 21.6, 95%CI: 4.68-100.1). Specifically, CD subjects with heterozygous (TC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582 was 25/37 (67.6%) compared to 0/22 (0.00%) in healthy controls with heterozygous (TC) alleles (P < 0.05, OR = 91.8, 95%CI: 5.14-1640.3). The CD subjects with heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles group (34/56 = 60.7%) and CD subjects with heterozygous (TC) allele group (25/37 = 67.6%) in PTPN2:rs478582 had higher MAPbacteremia compared to CD subjects with normal (TT) alleles (6/12 = 50%).\n\nFor CD subjects with heterozygous (GA) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601, 3/10 (30.0%) had MAPbacteremia compared to 0/4 (0.00%) in healthy controls with heterozygous (GA) alleles (OR = 4.2, 95%CI: 0.17-101.5). Presence of MAPbacteremia was rare in all subjects with the minor (AA) allele.\n\nCorrelation of haplotype combinations of PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 alleles on susceptibility to MAPbacteremia was analyzed, where CD subjects with the C-G haplotype (heterozygous or minor/major) had 31/46 (67.4%) with MAPbacteremia presence compared to 2/29 (6.90%) of healthy controls with the C-G haplotype (P-values < 0.05, OR = 30.0, 95%CI: 6.3-142.6). The T-A haplotype (major/heterozygous or minor) and the C-A haplotype (heterozygous or minor/heterozygous or minor) was rare in all samples. However, CD subjects with the T-A haplotype had 1/2 (50.0%) with MAPbacteremia presence compared to the 0/2 (0.00%) in healthy controls with the T-A haplotype, while CD subjects with the C-A haplotype had 3/9 (33.3%) with MAPbacteremia presence compared to the 0/2 (0.00%) in healthy controls with the C-A haplotype.\n\nRelationship of combined MAP presence with PTPN2:rs478582 and PTPN22:rs2476601 on expression of PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ in CD\n\nWhen examining CD and healthy control subjects with or without MAPbacteremia presence alone, there was no change in PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ relative gene expression when examining correlation data. However, PTPN2 was significantly lower in CD subjects than in the health control subjects regardless of MAPbacteremia presence or not. CD subjects who had MAPbacteremia presence had an average relative gene expression of 5.25 ± 2.58 (n = 21) in PTPN2 compared to the healthy controls with MAPbacteremia presence (11.9 ± 10.5, n =3, P < 0.05). CD subjects who had an absence of MAPbacteremia presence had an average relative gene expression of 5.28 ± 2.87 (n = 17) in PTPN2 compared to the healthy controls without MAPbacteremia presence (10.3 ± 6.71, n = 27, P < 0.05). For PTPN22 average relative gene expression, CD subjects with MAPbacteremia presence had 1.73 ± 0.97 (n = 21) compared to healthy controls with MAPbacteremia presence (2.83 ± 1.94, n = 3). CD subjects without MAPbacteremia presence had an average relative gene expression of 1.81 ± 1.31 (n = 17) in PTPN22 compared to the healthy controls without MAPbacteremia presence (3.29 ± 1.86, n = 27, P-values < 0.05).\n\nThe effect of combined MAPbacteremia presence and either PTPN2:rs478582 or PTPN22:rs2476601 did not significantly change PTPN2/22 expression in all CD and healthy control samples. However, when examining the combined effects of MAPbacteremia presence and either PTPN2:rs478582 or PTPN22:rs2476601, the average relative gene expression of IFN-γ does increase in subjects compared to subjects without MAPbacteremia presence and no SNPs. For CD subjects with both MAPbacteremia and heterozygous (TC) or minor (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582, the average relative gene expression of IFN-γ was higher (0.40 ± 0.29 n = 22) compared to the CD subjects without MAPbacteremia and PTPN2:rs478582 (0.23 ± 0.31, n = 5, Figure 4). For CD subjects with both MAPbacteremia and heterozygous (GA) or minor (CC) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601, the average relative gene expression of IFN-γ was higher (0.42 ± 0.32, n = 4) compared to the CD subjects without MAPbacteremia and PTPN22:rs2476601 (0.37 ± 0.31, n = 18).\n\nT-cell proliferation response in CD\n\nT-cell functionality when SNPs and MAPbacteremia was presented in subjects was determined in five CD and five healthy control subjects. All five CD subjects that had their T-cell response tested had SNPs in either PTPN2:rs478582 and/or PTPN22:rs2476601, while the five healthy control subjects had no observed SNPs present. Overall, when the subjects’ T-cells were treated with PHA, the average overall fold change in the CD subjects was 2.22 ± 1.36 (n = 5) fold increase compared to the healthy controls (1.67 ± 0.51 fold increase, n = 5). Similarly, when the same T-cells were treated with MAP PPD-like, the average overall fold change in CD subjects was 2.01 ± 0.79 (n = 5) compared to the healthy controls (1.39 ± 0.24 fold increase, n = 5).\n\nOut of the five CD subjects, 3/5 were tested for having MAPbacteremia presence. When examining T-cells treated with PHA from CD subjects tested positive for MAPbacteremia presence, the average overall fold change was 2.7 ± 1.65 (n = 3) compared to the CD subjects’ T-cells that were absence of MAPbacteremia presence and treated with PHA (1.51 ± 0.51 fold increase, n = 2). Similarly, when the same T-cells were treated with MAP PPD-like, the average overall fold change in CD subjects with MAPbacteremia was 2.5 ± 0.59 (n = 3) compared to the CD subjects’ T-cells without MAPbacteremia presence (1.27 ± 0.12 fold increase, n = 2)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nPTPN22 expression varies by lymphocyte subset and activation state.\n\nWe examined endogenous PTPN22 expression in human naïve, memory, and regulatory CD4+ T cell subsets at rest and following in vitro activation. CD4+ T cells were sorted from leukopacks determined to be homozygous for the T1D non-risk allele, which encodes LYP-620R. Since the transcriptional profile of activated cells is dramatically altered from that of the quiescent state, such that the standard array of housekeeping genes is broadly upregulated, we employed absolute quantification to assess PTPN22 expression. At rest, naïve Tconv expressed significantly less PTPN22 (387±83 transcripts/ng total RNA) than memory Tconv cells (741±169 transcripts/ng total RNA, P < 0.05) and Tregs (1014±120 transcripts/ng total RNA, P < 0.001) (Figure 1A). Following polyclonal activation, all three subsets rapidly increased PTPN22 expression, peaking at 24 hours (Figure 1B). Naïve CD4+ Tconv increased 12.00±5.45 fold from the quiescent state whereas memory Tconv increased 4.01±0.89 fold (P < 0.001 vs. naïve) and Treg increased 2.85±1.31 fold (P < 0.01 vs. naïve). Following the initial increase, PTPN22 expression decreased and plateaued around day 7. Taken together, we found PTPN22 expression to differ across T cell subsets at rest and in response to activation.\n\nOverexpression of PTPN22 decreases TCR signaling.\n\nNext, we examined whether LYP-620R and −620W may differentially modulate T cell function in Tconv and Treg populations. Naïve CD4+ Tconv and Treg were sorted from PBMCs from normal healthy control donors that were homozygous for the T1D non-risk PTPN22 allele (C/C at rs2476601 encoding LYP-620R). Cells were then activated and transduced with a lentivirus to express bicistronic constructs of the non-risk LYP-620R or the risk LYP-620W variant with an eGFP reporter following a 2A element, or with eGFP alone for a vector control condition (Supplemental Figure 1A–B). The cultures were expanded, followed by an extended rest period for a total of 21–28 days to allow for reversion of activation programs. We confirmed stable overexpression of PTPN22 transcripts and LYP protien for each variant (Supplemental Figure 1C–E and Supplemental Figure 2).\n\nThe proximal signaling events resulting from TCR ligation lead to assembly and activation of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) signalosome, followed by diverging downstream signaling pathways. These include calcium signaling and MAPK/ERK pathways. We sought to determine the functional impact of the non-risk and risk LYP variants on these downstream signaling pathways in Tconv and Treg. We first assessed Ca2+ flux by comparing stably transduced cells to non-transduced (eGFP-) internal culture control cells (Supplemental Figure 3). As expected, LYP-620R expressing Tconv exhibited 25.8±3.7% less Ca2+ flux than non-transduced Tconv, whereas transduction with eGFP alone had no effect (Figure 2A). A similar effect was observed for LYP-620R Tregs in which Ca2+ flux was diminished by 40.3±13.3% compared to non-transduced Tregs (Figure 2B). Conversely, LYP-620W expression only resulted in 4.9±1.6% and 7.9±2.7% less Ca2+ flux in Tconv and Treg, respectively (Figure 2A–B). These differences were not different from T cells transduced with eGFP alone. Thus, the risk LYP-620W variant less effectively downregulated TCR-induced Ca2+ flux.\n\nWe next assessed the impact of LYP modulation on the MAPK/ERK pathway via pERK signaling following TCR ligation. As with Ca2+ signaling, we observed decreased pERK relative to mock transfected cells in both Tconv and Tregs when LYP-620R was overexpressed (Figure 2C–D). Once again, the impact of LYP-620W on TCR signaling was diminished in both subsets when compared to LYP-620R. Taken together, these results indicate that the LYP risk variant has a diminished capacity to regulate TCR signaling activity.\n\nThe risk variant of PTPN22 permits increased T cell activation.\n\nIn response to Ca2+ flux and pERK signaling, T cells express receptors on their surface to direct activation. We further explored the impact of LYP variants by examining the experssion of a set of these activation markers. Stably transduced T cells were activated with autologous APCs, and surface expression of activation markers was assessed at 0, 4, 24, 48, 72, and 144 hours by flow cytometry. As expected, CD69, ICOS, CD25, CD226, and PD-1 were observed to be dynamically expressed following Tconv activation (Supplemental Figure 4A–D). Likewise, Tregs also exhibited activation-induced expression kinetics for CD69, ICOS, CD226, CTLA-4 (Supplemental Figure 4E–F). Interestingly, while most activation marker kinetics involved an intensification followed by a reduction of surface expression, the kinetics of CD226 on Tregs waned before increasing to a level higher than baseline (Supplemental Figure 4H). When normalized to internal mock-transfected controls, the activation marker kinetics on both Tconv (Figure 3A–E) and Tregs (Figure 3F–J) were blunted by overexpression of LYP-620R, with the exception of CD226 on Tconv (Figure 3D). Similar to what was observed with Ca2+ and pERK signaling, cells expressing the LYP-620W variant were less impacted, supporting the notion that the R620W variant confers a loss-of-function for LYP in terms of modulating of T cell activation.\n\nThe PTPN22 risk variant permits proliferation in Tconv, but not in Treg.\n\nWe demonstrated that the two LYP variants differentially modulate TCR signaling and expression of T cell activation markers. We next asked whether overexpression of the LYP variants would differentially modulate T cell proliferation. Activation-induced proliferation of Tconv and Treg cells was assessed by dilution of cell tracking dye following in vitro activation. Transduced cells (eGFP+) were cultured with mock-transduced (eGFP-) internal culture control cells. The cultures were activated with either anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 with irradiated APCs, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 bound to microbeads, or with PMA and ionomycin. While expression of the eGFP reporter did not affect proliferation, overexpression of LYP-620R reduced APC-mediated proliferation of Tconv and Treg by 35.32±15.30% and 19.80±17.26%, respectively (Figure 4A–B). In Tconv, the LYP-620W variant was once again deficient in its ability to downregulate activation, as it did not impede proliferation to the same degree that was observed for the LYP-620R variant (Figure 4A). However, the LYP-620W variant was capable of blocking Treg proliferation to a similar degree as the LYP-620R variant (Figure 4B), indicating a differential impact of PTPN22 on Tconv and Tregs.\n\nAs expected, mitogenic activation by PMA and ionomycin was not altered by LYP overexpression, as all transduced Tconv and Treg proliferated to a comparable degree as their internal mock control cells (Figure 4A–B). Unexpectedly however, proliferation was also unaltered in transduced cells that were activated by microbeads (Figure 4A–B). To assess whether this was due to TCR signal strength, we repeated the experiment with K562 aAPCs loaded with titrated ratios of activating and isotype antibodies. The aAPCs did not induce proliferation when loaded with 0% anti-CD3 (100% isotype), whereas 10% and 50% anti-CD3 induced incrementally more proliferation, with a plateau from 50% to 100% anti-CD3 (Supplemental Figure 5A). In all cases, the proliferation of transduced cells was similar to their internal controls (Supplemental Figure 5B). Similar results were found when CD4 was included in the activation signal to allow for LYP-LCK interactions (Supplemental Figure 5C–D). This suggests that optimized signal strength, as well as fluid membrane interface are not sufficient to recapitulate the differential inhibition of proliferation by the two LYP variants, and that other factors supplied by natural APCs (e.g., adhesion molecules, soluble factors, and/or co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory ligand and downstream signaling interactions) may be required.\n\nOverexpression of PTPN22 influences T cell cytokine production.\n\nCD4+ effector T cells modulate host immune responses after encountering cognate antigens, in part, through the production of an array of cytokines. Thus, we sought to assess the impact of LYP variant expression on the secretion of cytokines important in driving Th1 and Th2-associated immunity. Sorted transduced Tconv cells were activated with APCs, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28, and culture supernatants were assayed for cytokines over a 72-hour time period. The net accumulation of IL-2 in this system is a function of activation-induced secretion and of consumption via the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) because the high-affinity component, CD25, is dramatically upregulated in this time period (Supplemental Figure 4). We found that the net accumulation of IL-2 was not altered by overexpression of the LYP-620R variant, but was increased at the 24-hour time point by the LYP-620W variant (Figure 5A). The secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 was robustly inhibited for the first 48 hours by expression of either LYP variant. At the72-hour time point, inhibition occurred to a somewhat lesser degree by LYP-620W, thought this difference was not significant between variants (Figure 5B–F). Finally, and somewhat surprisingly given the documented Th1 signature implicated in several of the autoimmune disorders that are associated with the rs2476601 risk variant, IFNγ secretion was not altered by overexpression of either variant of LYP (Figure 5G). This result is in agreement with studies of Ptpn22 knockout mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both LYP variants result in similar levels of effector cytokine secretion.\n\nTreg-mediated suppression is altered by overexpressed PTPN22.\n\nOur data demonstrated that PTPN22 is more highly expressed in Treg as compared to Tconv (Figure 1A). We therefore hypothesized that the PTPN22 risk variant may influence disease risk by altering Treg-mediated suppression. Hence, we assessed whether transduced Treg were deficient in their suppressive capacity and whether transduced Tconv were refractory to Treg suppression. In order to determine the effect of overexpressed LYP variants on Tresp, irradiated autologous APCs and titered amounts of Treg were co-cultured with transduced Tconv (eGFP+) and mock-transduced (eGFP-) internal control Tconv. We found that, similar to our previous results (Figure 4A), overexpressed LYP-620R significantly repressed Tresp proliferation while repression by LYP-620W was dramatically reduced across the Treg:Tresp range (Figure 6A). However, the relative suppression of transduced Tresp did not differ significantly from their internal mock controls (Figure 6B). This suggests that the Tconv-intrinsic susceptibility conferred by LYP-620W is due to reduced control over activation, proliferation, and effector mechanisms, rather than a defect in the ability of effector cells to be suppressed by Treg.\n\nFinally, we assessed the effect of the LYP variants on Treg suppressive capacity by co-culturing titered amounts of sorted transduced (eGFP+) Treg with irradiated autologous APCs and untransduced Tresp. We found suppression by Tregs overexpressing LYP-620R to be similar to eGFP reporter Tregs, while suppression by Tregs expressing the risk LYP-620W variant was slightly increased (Figure 6C). Consistent with our previous result (Figure 4B), Treg proliferation in the suppression assay co-culture was similar for LYP-620R and LYP-620W (Figure 6D). This indicates that the difference in suppressive capacity was not due to differences in Treg proliferation, and suggests a Treg intrinsic impact of LYP-620W to enhance suppressive function."

    "content": "Results\n\nTAG72-CAR T cells containing a 4-1BB intracellular co-stimulatory domain demonstrate in vitro activation against purified TAG72\n\nOur first goal was to develop a second-generation TAG72-BBζ CAR construct containing the humanized scFv CC49, the human IgG4 Fc extracellular spacer lacking a CH2 domain (ΔCH2), the CD4 transmembrane domain, the 4-1BB intracellular co-stimulatory domain, and the CD3ζ cytolytic domain followed by a truncated CD19 (CD19t) for cell tracking (Figure 1A). We selected this CAR construct based on our recent preclinical investigations demonstrating potent anti-tumor activity of 4-1BB-containing CARs for solid tumors. TAG72-BBζ CAR lentivirus was used to transduce human healthy donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells depleted of CD14+ and CD25+ cells (dPBMC), as previously described. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells were enriched during the manufacturing process (based on CD19t+ selection) and were stably expressed on the surface of T cells (Figure 1B). CAR T cells expanded ex vivo with similar kinetics and comparable CD4:CD8 ratios to Mock (untransduced) T cells (data not shown and Figure 1C). Importantly, and as a first measure of CAR T cell activation against TAG72, we demonstrated dose-dependent CD137 expression on the surface of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells when cultured with plate-bound, but not soluble, purified TAG72 (Figure 1D). Similar dose-dependent induction of cell-surface CD69 expression and IFNγ release was observed with plate-bound TAG72 (Supplemental Figures 1A,B).\n\nTAG72-BBζ CAR T cells effectively target ovarian cancer cells in vitro\n\nWe next sought to evaluate cell-surface TAG72 expression on human ovarian cancer cell lines, including SKOV3, OVCAR8, COV362.4, OVCAR3, OV90, as well as the TAG72+ colon cancer line, LS174T. Prior studies have demonstrated expression of TAG72 by immunohistochemistry of ovarian tumor patient samples and by western blotting of human ovarian cancer cell lines. By flow cytometry, TAG72 was expressed on OVCAR3 cells (approximately 42%) and to a greater extent on OV90 cells (approximately 90%), with very low levels detected on COV362.4 cells (Figure 2A). TAG72 was absent on SKOV3 and OVCAR8 cells. Immunofluorescence staining of tumor cells confirmed TAG72 expression and cellular localization on the cell surface as well as intracellularly (data not shown). Importantly, we observed higher expression of TAG72 on OVCAR3 and OV90 cells harvested from the ascites of tumor-bearing animals as compared to in vitro cultured cells (Supplemental Figure 2).\n\nTo assess antigen-dependent activity of our TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells, we performed co-cultured assays with TAG72-positive and -negative ovarian tumor targets at an E:T ratio between 1:1 and 1:2 to determine their killing potential. After 24 h, antigen-specific T cell-mediated killing activity was evident with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells relative to Mock T cells (Figure 2B). Amongst TAG72-expressing targets, an average of 59% LS174T, 79% OVCAR3, and 67% OV90 cells were killed. After 72 h, killing of the same tumor lines increased to 77, 90, and 97%, respectively. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells showed minimal killing of TAG72-negative or low expressing SKOV3, OVCAR8, and COV362.4 cells. We further demonstrated the specificity of our TAG72-CAR T cells using a previously described CAR targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) with the same CAR design (Supplemental Figure 3). At 72 h, we observed TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell expansion (2–3 fold) against TAG72-positive tumor cells (Figure 2C). Similar tumor killing was observed at lower E:T ratios of 1:10 (data not shown), demonstrating the potent killing ability of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells. TAG72 is shed from tumor cells in a soluble form, which we showed minimally impacted the tumor killing ability of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (Supplemental Figure 4). We then evaluated cytokine production from CAR T cells as an additional measure of T cell activity. IFNγ and IL-2 cytokine production was observed only when TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells were co-cultured with antigen-positive tumor targets, OVCAR3, LS174T, and OV90 (Figures 2D,E). While IL-2 production peaked at early time points (24 h) and was detectable only against OVCAR3 at later time points (72 h), IFNγ levels were more sustained over 72 h.\n\nTAG72-BBζ CAR T cells target TAG72-positive cells from ovarian cancer ascites in vitro\n\nTo further confirm TAG72 as an ovarian cancer CAR target and the anti-tumor activity of our TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells, we performed in vitro assays utilizing human ovarian cancer ascites from three patients (OAS3, OAS4, OAS7). Freshly thawed ascites from OAS3, OAS4, and OAS7 expressed 62, 80, and 67% TAG72, respectively, by flow cytometry (data not shown), but after 72 h in culture, was reduced to 2, 53, and 19%, respectively (Figure 2F), likely reflecting an influence of ex vivo culturing conditions on maintenance of TAG72 expression. We then evaluated the cytolytic activity of CAR T cells after 72 h of co-culture with freshly thawed patient primary ovarian cancer ascites, and showed potent and selective CAR-mediated killing of the TAG72-positive OAS4 and OAS7 cells, with no detectable anti-tumor activity against the TAG72-negative OAS3 cells (Figure 2G). TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells produced IFNγ and IL-2 against OAS4, but not OAS3 and OAS7 cells (Figure 2H, Supplemental Figure 5).\n\nRegional intraperitoneal delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells exhibits potent anti-tumor activity and extends survival in ovarian ascites-bearing mice\n\nTo evaluate the therapeutic potential of our TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in vivo, we first established TAG72+ OVCAR3 tumors in immune compromised NSG mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, to mimic peritoneal ovarian tumors observed in late-stage human disease. OVCAR3 cells were lentivirally transduced to express eGFP/ffluc to allow for tracking of tumor growth via non-invasive optical imaging. At 14 days post-tumor i.p. injection, mice were treated with Mock or TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (5.0 × 106) by systemic intravenous (i.v.) or regional i.p. delivery (Figure 3A). We observed rapid anti-tumor effects in mice treated with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells via regional i.p. delivery, reaching a maximal anti-tumor response 1–2 weeks following treatment (Figures 3B,C). In comparison to regional delivery, i.v. delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells showed limited anti-tumor responses. Anti-tumor responses in mice were durable for 3–4 weeks, but ultimately tumor recurrences were observed in mice. Regional i.p. delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells significantly extended survival of mice, with limited benefits observed by i.v. delivery (Figure 3D).\n\nTo address potential differences observed between i.p. and i.v. therapy, we measured CAR T cells in the blood and ascites of mice. Strikingly, appreciable numbers of CAR T cells (huCD45+CD19t+) were found in the blood of mice 6 days post i.p. treatment, with more than 5-fold fewer CAR T cells in the blood of i.v. treated mice at the same time point (Figure 3E, Supplemental Figure 6). However, we observed equivalent numbers of CAR T cells in the blood of i.p. and i.v. treated mice at later time points, expanding from 1 to 2 weeks, with significant reductions at 4 weeks post-treatment. We then evaluated CAR T cell presence in the ascites of treated mice, and observed CAR T cells at the site of tumors at day 6 post i.p. treatment, with no detectable CAR T cells in i.v. treated mice at the same time point. However, at day 13 post-treatment, similar levels of CAR T cells were observed in mice treated i.v. and i.p. (Figure 3F). These data suggest that CAR T cells eventually reached the tumor following i.v. delivery but with delayed kinetics compared with i.p. delivery, which was likely in part responsible for the lack of observed therapy by this route of administration. CD45-negative cells, likely majority being OVCAR3 tumor cells, were significantly depleted in i.p. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treated mice, but not i.p. or i.v. Mock T cell or i.v. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treated mice. These data support regional intraperitoneal delivery of TAG72-CAR T cells as an effective method of targeting peritoneal ovarian tumors in mice.\n\nRepeat treatment with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells controls tumor more effectively\n\nBased on our findings with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in OVCAR3-bearing mice, we next evaluated the OV90 i.p. model, with more uniform TAG72 expression in vitro compared with OVCAR3 (Figure 2A). We first confirmed effectiveness of regional CAR T cell delivery in this model and showed similarly to the OVCAR3 model, i.p., but not i.v. TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treatment showed anti-tumor efficacy in the OV90 model (Supplemental Figure 7A). Overall survival was only delayed by approximately 25 days in this model with i.p. delivery of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (Supplemental Figure 7B), likely owing to the aggressive nature of this model. We therefore evaluated whether repeat TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell dosing compared with a single dose improves therapeutic responses (Figure 4A). Compared with a single dose of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells, repeat dosing over the course of 1 month demonstrated more durable anti-tumor responses in the OV90 model (Figures 4B,C). When plotted as relative tumor growth kinetics, repeat dosing promoted more extensive tumor regression as well as more durable control of tumors compared with single dosing (Figure 4D).\n\nIn this study, the overall survival was extended significantly in mice that received repeat doses of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells (55 day benefit) compared with a single dose (30 day benefit) (Figure 4E). Greater T cell numbers were observed in peritoneal tumors of mice with repeat treatment (Figure 4F). Importantly, however, we observed reduced numbers, expansion and persistence of CAR T cells in the blood of OV90-bearing mice, compared with the OVCAR3 model (Supplemental Figures 8A,B), suggesting that this more aggressive tumor model may also harbor suppressive mechanisms that hamper T cell function and overall CAR T cell efficacy. Collectively, these data demonstrate potent anti-tumor activity of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in ovarian cancer xenograft models, and also suggest that repeat dosing of regionally delivered CAR T cells may provide greater control of tumors compared with a single dose.\n\nTumor recurrences following TAG72-CAR T cell therapy show antigen escape\n\nOne of the major resistance mechanisms to CAR T cell therapy is the tumor antigen heterogeneity that exists in solid tumors that promotes eventual antigen loss or escape. While the loss of CAR T cells in our two models preceded tumor recurrences, we next evaluated expression of TAG72 in tumors from Mock and TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell treated mice at various time points pre- and post- therapy. Since TAG72, MUC1, and MUC16 have all been identified as potential targets in ovarian cancer, we first assessed expression of these cell surface antigens on TAG72-negative OVCAR8, and TAG72-positive OVCAR3 and OV90 cells. OVCAR8 appeared to only express low levels of MUC1, and was absent for TAG72 and MUC16, while OVCAR3 expressed all three antigens at varying levels, and OV90 showed low expression of MUC1 and was absent for MUC16 (Figure 5A). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of these antigens in OVCAR3 tumors from mice treated with Mock or TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells. At 12 weeks post T cell infusion, tumors from Mock-treated mice showed heterogeneous expression of TAG72 (similar to flow cytometric analysis of the cell line), MUC16, and MUC1 (Figure 5B). However, tumor recurrences at early time points from mice treated with TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells showed a dramatic reduction in TAG72 expression, while maintaining expression of MUC16 and MUC1. Similarly, repeat treatment of TAG72-BBζ CAR T cells in the OV90 tumor model also showed a reduction in TAG72 expression in early recurrent tumors following treatment (Figure 5C). Interestingly, the expression of TAG72 was detected at high levels in tumor recurrences at later time points, in solid tumors as well as in ascites (Figures 5C,D). We further confirmed this finding in vitro, showing that residual viable OVCAR3 tumor cells remaining after CAR T cell co-culture expressed lower TAG72, but showed typical TAG72 expression levels on tumor cells that grew out in the absence of CAR T cells (Figure 5E). Similar reductions in TAG72 expression were observed with OV90 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that antigen escape plays a key role in tumor recurrences following TAG72-BBζ CAR T cell therapy."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nA total of 1,144 Hutterites (613 females, 53.6%) aged 6–89 years (mean ± SD, 30.6 ± 18.4 years) with both genome-wide genotyping and spirometry phenotypes were included in the GWAS (Table 1). These same data are shown for the non-asthmatic and asthmatic sample subsets in Table E2 in the Online Repository.\n\nHeritability of lung function in the Hutterites\n\nThe broad (H2) and narrow (h2) heritabilities of lung function measures in the Hutterites were h2 = H2 = 40.2% (SE 5.4%) for FEV1, h2 = 17.8% (SE 3.7%) and H2 = 70.4% (SE 11.2%) for FVC, and h2 = 22.1% (SE 8.0%) and H2 = 91.5% (SE 12.9%) for FEV1/FVC. These estimates indicate that 40.2%, 70.4%, and 91.5% of the phenotypic variances in FEV1, FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio, respectively, are attributable to genetic variation in the Hutterites. The heritabilities of FVC and FEV1/FVC included both additive and non-additive (i.e., dominance) genetic variance components, whereas the heritability of FEV1 was comprised entirely of additive genetic variance.\n\nGWAS of lung function traits\n\nWe identified genome-wide significant associations between FEV1/FVC and five SNPs at the THSD4-UACA-TLE3 locus on chromosome 15q23 (see Fig. E2a in the Online Repository), replicating results from previous GWAS. Overall, there were 21 SNPs at this locus with P < 10−5 (see Table E3 in the Online Repository). The most significant SNP at this locus, rs12441227, explained 2.9% of the residual variance in FEV1/FVC in the Hutterites. The evidence for association with SNPs at this locus remained when the individuals with asthma were excluded (Fig. E2d), and when the sample was stratified by age (Table E4).\n\nNine additional SNPs at four loci had P-values < 10−5 with FEV1/FVC, including SNPs downstream of the C10orf11 gene on chromosome 10q22.3, which was associated with FEV1 in a meta-analysis of lung function GWAS. When a sub-analysis was performed excluding the Hutterites with asthma, the evidence for association at this locus increased to genome-wide levels of significance (Table E4, Fig. E2f) The evidence for associations with SNPs at three of these loci with P-values < 10−5, CCL23-CCL18 on chromosome 17q12 (Fig. E2b and E2e), PITPNC1 locus on chromosome 17q24.2, and CHAF1B on chromosome 21q22.13, remained in sub-analyses excluding asthmatics. The evidence for association at all locus with P-values < 10−5 was present in subset analyses stratified by age (Table E4). Only two SNPs had P-values < 10−5 in the GWAS for the other two phenotypes: one SNP 7k downstream of the IL37 gene on chromosome 2q13 was associated with FEV1 and one SNP in an intron of ASXL3 on chromosome 18q12.1 was associated with FVC.\n\nThe Manhattan and Q-Q plots of P-values for the GWAS of the three phenotypes are shown in Fig. 1; results for all SNPs with P < 10−5 are shown in Table E3 in the Online Repository. The GWAS P-values in the Hutterites for the 27 loci associated with lung function in previous meta-analyses are shown in Table E5 in the Online Repository. Overall, we found nominal evidence (P < 0.05) of association with at least one of the three phenotypes for 14 SNPs at 9 of the 27 previously reported loci; and five SNPs at an additional five previously reported loci were associated with at least one of the three phenotypes at P < 0.01.\n\nMultimarker modeling\n\nWe assumed that there were additional true associations among the GWAS SNPs that did not reach genome-wide levels of significance because their effects are too small to detect in single SNP analyses, especially in a sample size of ~1,000 subjects. Therefore, to assess a multimarker model of risk including all SNPs with P < 10−3, we performed LASSO regression to identify minimum sets of SNPs that provided the smallest mean square error of FEV1/FVC in the Hutterites. A set of 80 SNPs yielded the best predictive value and were used for further study (see Table E6 in the Online Repository).\n\nFirst, we assessed the phenotypic effects of these 80 SNPs by binning individuals by the total number of alleles associated with reduced FEV1/FVC that they carried (total possible = 160) and calculated the mean (SE) residual FEV1/FVC for Hutterites in each bin. The mean residual FEV1/FVC decreased with increasing number of ‘low FEV1/FVC alleles’, consistent with an additive genetic architecture (Fig. 2).\n\nNext, we used the GRAIL algorithm to mine the Gene Ontology database for evidence of functional connections between genes near the 80 predictive SNPs. We identified a subset of six SNPs with significantly related genes (GRAIL P < 0.05), including three clusters of β-defensin genes, two chemokine genes (CCL18 and CXCL12), and TNFRSF13B (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Notably, the associated GWAS SNPs at two replicated loci, THSD4-UACA-TLE3 and C10orf11, were not functionally connected to any other genes defined by the 80 SNPs. However, a SNP at the CCL23-CCL18 locus, the second most significant locus in the Hutterite GWAS (see Fig. E3b in the Online Repository), was significantly connected to the β-defensin genes, as well as to CXCL12 and TNFRSF13B in the GRAIL analysis. These six SNPs by themselves explained 5.8% of the residual variance in FEV1/FVC in the Hutterites."

    "content": "4. Results\n\n4.1. Literature Search\n\nIn total, the number of cases and controls were 4422 and 5210 in 16 studies, respectively (Table 1). As to CTLA4, the SNPs which were mostly consulted were rs231775, rs231725, rs3087243, and rs5742909. These SNPs were reported in 14, 6, 9, and 5 studies, respectively. The genotypes of controls were in line with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in most articles.\n\n4.2. Meta-Analysis\n\nObvious heterogeneity was identified in CTLA4 rs231775 polymorphism (G versus A: P(het) = 0.008, I2 = 54.1%; GG versus AA: P(het) = 0.032, I2 = 45.6%), rs3087243 polymorphism (GA versus GG: P(het) = 0.028, I2 = 53.5%; AA + GA versus GG: P(het) = 0.037, I2 = 51.2%), and rs5742909 polymorphism (T versus C: P(het) = 0.001, I2 = 69.4%; TC versus CC: P(het) = 0.01, I2 = 66.7%; and (TT + TC) versus CC: P(het) = 0.007, I2 = 69%). Therefore, we chose the random-effect model to generate extensive CIs in these genetic models, the rest of genetic models were used the fixed-effects model (Table 2).\n\nThe results of this analysis in the association of CTLA4 polymorphisms (rs231775, rs231725, rs3087243, and rs5742909) with susceptibility to PBC are presented (Table 3).\n\nThe study identified that rs231775 polymorphism of CTLA4 was significantly associated with PBC susceptibility. The ORs (95%CIs) of G versus A, GG versus AA, GA versus AA, (GG + GA) versus AA, and GG versus (AA + GA) were 1.32 (1.19–1.47), 1.72 (1.37–2.16), 1.27 (1.13–1.43), 1.38 (1.23–1.54), and 1.52 (1.35–1.71), respectively. As to each model, the p value was below 0.0001 (Figure 1). The rs231725 polymorphism also showed significant association with PBC susceptibility. The ORs with 95%CIs of A versus G, AA versus GG, GA versus GG, (AA + GA) versus GG, and AA versus (GG + GA) were 1.33 (1.22–1.45), 1.83 (1.52–2.21), 1.20 (1.04–1.38), 1.34 (1.17–1.53), and 1.57 (1.35–1.82), respectively. As to each genetic model, the p value was below 0.05 (Figure 2). Nevertheless, no association was identified between rs3087243 (Figure 3) and rs5742909 (Figure 4) polymorphisms and PBC susceptibility. Subgroup analysis showed that both rs231775 and rs231725 showed significant association with PBC susceptibility for Asians and for Caucasians.\n\n4.3. Calculation of Linkage Disequilibrium\n\nBased on the values of r2, there was no obviously linkage disequilibrium among four SNPs (Table 4).\n\n4.4. Sensitivity Analyses and Publication Bias\n\nSensitivity analysis was conducted by omitting each studies sequentially, suggesting that the results for the overall population were statistically stable and reliable (Figure 5). Publication bias was examined by using Egger's regression and Begg's funnel plot in our research. No obvious publication bias was identified. For Begg's test, p values of rs231775 (G versus A), rs231725 (A versus G), rs3087243 (A versus G), and rs5742909 (T versus C) were 0.661, 0.806, 0.466, and 0.060, respectively. For Egger's test, p values of genetic models mentioned above were 0.952, 0.186, 0.061, and 0.029, respectively (Figure 6)."

    "content": "Results\n\nGenetic control of gene expression in T cells\n\nWe purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 313 healthy European individuals from the Estonian Biobank. The purified cells were subjected to genome-wide gene expression analysis, genotyping and imputation using the 1000 Genomes reference panel. After stringent quality control and filtering, close to 6 million SNPs, and expression data from 38,839 probes within 23,704 genes were included in the analysis. DNA methylation of 450,000 CpG sites was determined in the same purified cells of 100 of the individuals to add explanations to observed differential expression between cell types.\n\nTo characterize the extent of genetic control of gene expression in T cells and its cellular specificity, we first tested the association between SNPs and gene expression within 1Mb intervals, referred to as cis-eQTLs. In total, we identified cis regulatory SNPs for 2,605 genes in CD4+ T cells and 2,056 genes in CD8+ T cells at probe-level false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 (Fig 1A, S1 Table), with an overlap of 1,637 genes and estimated replication rate π1 = 0.99. The high replication rate reflects the similarity of the two cell types compared, and also highlights the limitations of arbitrary cut-off levels for significance. Moreover, about half of the significant eQTLs detected in a large meta-analysis of peripheral blood from 5000 individuals could be replicated in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (π1 = 0.51 and 0.45, respectively, S1 Fig), indicating a high level of T cell-specific eQTL effects. As examples of cis-eQTLs in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we observed evidence of genetic regulation of long coding RNA RP11−534L20.5 located 7 kb downstream of the IKBKE gene which has an essential role in regulating inflammatory responses to viral infections; STAT6, a transcriptional activator involved in T cell differentiation, and STX2 (syntaxin 2), involved in intracellular transport of vesicles (Fig 1B).\n\nCell type-specificity of eQTLs\n\nWe next used a Bayesian model averaging and hierarchical modelling that combines information across genes to jointly call eQTLs in one framework to assess the specificity and proportion of shared eQTLs in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Of 3871 genes associated with eQTLs, all showed very strong posterior probability to be shared between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (S2 Table).\n\nOne of the strengths of the multi-tissue joint cis-eQTL analysis is its capability to account for incomplete power. As our sample size for both of the cell types was similar, we noted the advantage of Bayesian methods in particular for genes with eQTLs that have modest effects. Moreover, for eQTLs where the absolute effect size was higher in one cell type, there was also a tendency for higher expression levels in that gene in the given cell type (chi-square test P-value < 2x10-16, S2 Fig). For a standard tissue-by-tissue analysis, higher effect sizes and small standard deviations lead to more statistical evidence against the null, thus resulting in lower P-values.\n\nThe effect of the magnitude of the expression levels is exemplified by the effect sizes and P-values of the probes in the inhibitory immune checkpoint gene, CTLA4, known to be associated with T1D and other endocrine autoimmune diseases. CTLA4 is covered by three probes all showing consistent eQTL effects shared by both cell types in the multi-tissue analysis (Fig 2A). In the tissue-by-tissue analysis, expression levels of CTLA4 were associated with 122 SNPs (S3A Fig), including T1D and RA-associated variants rs231775 (+49A/G), rs3087243 (CT60A/G), rs231806 (MH30C/G), and rs231735 (pair-wise r2 between the SNPs ranging from 0.51 to 0.90, and strong linkage disequilibrium (LD, r2 > 0.8) between MH30 and CT60, S3C Fig). The CT60 polymorphism is also in strong LD with length variation of the (AT)n repeat in the 3’UTR of CTLA4 with long variants of the repeat associating with lower CTLA4 mRNA expression in autoimmune T cell clones. Our results extend this finding to the polyclonal population of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, where the disease risk alleles were associated with lower expression levels of CTLA4 (S3B Fig). Genetic control of the expression of the alternatively spliced third exon, that is omitted from the secretory variant of CTLA4, was significantly detectable in CD4+ T cells only, whereas genetic association with the expression of the fourth exon was significant in both cell types (Fig 2B and 2E). Further investigation of the CTLA4 gene locus revealed differential methylation between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig 2C). Specifically, methylation of a CpG site near the second exon of CTLA4 (cg26091609) was inversely correlated with the expression levels of the three different probes in the gene (Fig 2D), possibly explaining the expression differences in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and thus failing to detect significant eQTL effects in the tissue-by-tissue analysis.\n\nInterestingly, divergent DNA methylation between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was similarly detectable for an additional 73 out of 187 genes covered by more than one probe, and with seemingly isoform-specific eQTL effects (S3 Table). Among the 74 genes, multi-tissue analysis resulted in the identification of eQTL effects for two or more probes in 66 genes which were shared between the cell types. These observations suggest that the differential splicing effects, plausibly regulated by epigenetic DNA methylation, influence the gene expression levels, and thus the power to significantly detect eQTLs in the tissue-by-tissue analysis.\n\nT cell specific trans-acting regulatory locus\n\nFor the analysis of SNPs affecting the expression of distal genes (>5 Mb apart), referred to as trans-eQTLs, we selected all 4,638 genome-wide significant (P-value < 5x10-8) SNPs from the GWAS catalog (accessed 24/03/2015). After correcting gene expression levels for cis-eQTL effects, we identified 36 and 40 GWAS SNPs associated with the expression levels of 209 and 378 distant genes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively (overlap of 21 SNPs and 133 genes; Fig 3A, S4 Table). The functions of the genes associated with the trans-acting GWAS SNPs highlighted their role in T1D (Ingenuity pathway analysis, P = 4.39x10-5, Fig 3A) and mTOR signaling (P = 3.84x10-3, Fig 3A) in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively.\n\nStrikingly, we observed a trans-acting regulatory locus at chr12q13.2 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with broad-range impact on hundreds of genes. Five SNPs in that region were previously implicated in B cell-specific trans-associations by Fairfax et al.. In T cells, we identified the lead SNP in this region as rs1131017 located in the 5´UTR of the ribosomal small subunit protein RPS26 gene (S5 Table). The rs1131017 SNP is in LD with eight GWAS SNPs implicated in T1D, vitiligo and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The pair-wise r2 values of the nine SNPs are shown in S4B Fig and their eQTL effects in S4C Fig, illustrating the strong LD (r2 > 0.8) between the top trans-eQTL SNP rs1131017 and several of the GWAS SNPs. In addition to RPS26, the trans-acting region contains the CDK2, RAB5B, SUOX, IKZF4 and ERBB3 genes (S4A Fig) and associates with the expression levels of 187 and 351 genes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, with an overlap of 124 genes (Fig 3B). Many of these genes are highly expressed and have specific roles in T cells such as CTLA4, GZMA, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY and CD8A (Fig 3B).\n\nMissense variant in IL27 as a candidate disease variant for T1D revealing significant trans-eQTL effects in CD4+ T cells\n\nWe also identified a trans-eQTL (GWAS SNP rs4788084[T]) on chr16p11.2 close to the IL27 gene associated with lower expression of IRF1 (P = 1.84x10-9) and STAT1 (P = 2.91x10-8) in CD4+ T cells only. The rs4788084[T] is associated with lower expression of STAT1 in peripheral blood and reduced risk for T1D. To further explore the effects of genetic variants in the IL27 region, we mapped trans-eQTLs for all SNPs in the chromosome 16:28,2–29,1 Mb region (829 SNPs in total, S6 Table, Fig 4A).\n\nThis analysis revealed an even stronger trans-eQTL signal for a missense SNP rs181206[G] within the IL27 gene (Fig 4B) and decreased expression levels of IRF1, STAT1 and REC8 (Fig 4C). The rs181206[G] allele, with a minor allele frequency of 29% in the 1000 Genomes phase 3 European population, causes the amino acid Leu119Pro change in the alpha-helical domain of IL-27 (S5 Fig). Strong LD (r2 ranges from 0.62 in the Estonian population to 0.84 in the other European populations, 1000 Genomes phase 3) between rs181206 and the GWAS SNP rs4788084 supports the protective role of the rs181206[G] allele for T1D among individuals of European ancestry. Of note, the effect of the missense SNP on IRF1 and STAT1 remains after regressing out the effect of the GWAS SNP, but not the other way around. Moreover, Bayesian test for colocalisation adds strength to the hypothesis that T1D susceptibility and changes of expression in IRF1 and STAT1 are associated with the region, and share a single causal variant with the most posterior support for rs181206[G] (S7 Table).\n\nImportantly, despite the relatively small sample size, our focus on T cell subtypes enabled us to identify this effect as specific to CD4+ T cells, as we did not detect significant trans-eQTL effects in this region in CD8+ T cells (S6 Fig). We also confirmed the absence of the signal in B cells and monocytes by re-analyzing the data from Fairfax et al. (S6 Fig). Notably, the trans-eQTL locus had no effects on the expression level of IL27 in cis (S7 Fig). In agreement with the cell type-specific effect, we found higher expression levels of the IL27RA and IL6ST (gp130) genes, which together act as a receptor for the IL-27 cytokine, in CD4+ cells in comparison to CD8+ T cells (Fig 4D).\n\nGiven the strong positive correlation between the expression levels of IRF1 and STAT1, we used structural equation modeling to determine whether the IL27 SNP rs181206 affects both genes independently or via each other. Overall, the best-fitting scenario suggested IRF1 to mediate the SNP and STAT1 relationship (model 1, S8 Table). The finding was supported by a simulation experiment (S8 Fig) and suggested a mechanism for the effect of IL-27 on IRF1 and STAT1 expression (S9 Fig).\n\nFunctional effects of the IL27 missense SNP suggest causal role in decreased expression of IRF1 and STAT1\n\nIn order to confirm the functional effect of the IL27 rs181206[G] allele we investigated its effect on IRF1 and STAT1 expression in human PBMCs by additional experiments. IL-27 is produced by innate immune cells, and after forming a heterodimer with EBI3, it interacts with its receptor IL27RA and activates the STAT1/STAT3 pathway in T cells. After binding to interferon stimulated response elements (ISRE), the STAT1/STAT3 pathway induces transcription of several interferon-induced genes, including IRF1 and STAT1 itself. We cloned cDNA variants of the IL-27 wild-type (Leu119) and missense (Pro119), as well as EBI3. After transfection into HEK293 cells, we combined the cell supernatants containing either IL-27 Leu119 or Pro119 protein with an equal amount of EBI3 protein and studied their effect on IRF1 and STAT1 expression by real-time PCR in human PBMCs from four healthy individuals.\n\nAs shown in Fig 4E, the missense SNP resulting in Pro119 in IL-27 induced lower STAT1 and IRF1 transcript levels compared to IL-27 Leu119. The comparison of the fixed effects of the rs181206[G] allele resulted in highly significant estimates:  = -1.11 (P = 5.52x10-13) for IRF1 and  = -1.28 (P = 4.86x10-10) for STAT1. This result supports our trans-eQTL analysis, suggesting that the Pro119 in the IL27 gene is the causal SNP of these associations."

    "content": "Results\n\nIL-8 Serum and mRNA Expression Levels\n\nIn the current study, we compared the level of IL-8 protein in the serum and mRNA of 170 cases and 170 controls (Fig. 1). The IL-8 serum levels were significantly higher in patient (48.82 ± 27.36 pg/ml) than in control (10.67 ± 4.62 pg/ml; P < 0.0001) group (Fig. 1a). \n\nNo significant difference in PBMC composition between patients with asthma and healthy controls was claimed.\n\nWe found that the IL-8 serum concentrations were markedly elevated in children with moderate and severe asthma (n = 81; 71.55 ± 21.09 pg/ml) than those with mild form (n = 89; 28.55 ± 21.14 pg/ml, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2a). \n\nWe also reported in Fig. 1b, a significantly higher IL-8 mRNA levels in patients than in controls (P = 0.004). IL-8 mRNA levels were further increased in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma compared to mild asthma group (P = 0.025) (Fig. 2b).\n\nHowever, the IL-8 mRNA expression and the distribution of protein levels, according to different IL-8 genotypes for both polymorphisms did not differ significantly in the asthmatic group (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nGenotype Analysis of IL-8 Gene\n\nThe distribution of rs4073 and rs2227306 genotype frequencies for healthy controls and patients with asthma was in agreement with HWE (data not shown).\n\nWe observed a significant difference in the genotype and allele distributions of rs4073 and rs2227306 polymorphisms between asthmatic and healthy children (Table 2). \n\nFor the rs4073, the homozygous TT genotype was more frequent in asthmatic than in control groups (P = 0.002). The presence of this genotype was significantly associated with an increased asthma risk (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.28–2.48). Then, the presence of the rs4073 T allele is considered as a risk factor for asthma development.\n\nThe allele and genotype frequencies of rs2227306 were also significantly different between case and control groups, which suggest that the rs2227306 was associated with asthma susceptibility. Our results indicated that the subjects carrying CC or CT genotypes were more exposed to develop asthma compared to those carrying the TT genotype (OR > 2; P = 0.036).\n\nWe also analyzed the association of these polymorphisms with atopy. The frequency of the rs4073 TT and rs2227306 CC genotypes differed significantly between children with atopic asthma and healthy controls (P = 0.005 and P = 0.02, respectively). The presence of the rs4073 TT (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.25–2.65) or the rs2227306 CC (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14–2.47) genotypes was associated with an increased risk to develop atopic asthma (Table 3). \n\nSubject with at least one copy of rs4073 T allele had more risk to be diagnosed with asthma disease at an advanced stage (P = 0.02; OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.12–13.29) (Supplementary Table 1). Then, the rs4073 T allele is considered as a risk factor for asthma severity in Tunisian children.\n\nHaplotype Frequencies of IL-8 Gene\n\nLD test between IL-8 polymorphisms was estimated by the value of D’ (0.151). The most frequent diplotype in our population was TC (42.6%), but no significant difference was shown between patients and controls (P > 0.05). Therefore, the frequency of the rare diplotype AT was significantly associated with low asthma childhood risk in our population (P C < 0.0004) (Supplementary Table 2)."

    "content": "5 Simulation Results\n\nThe empirical Type 1 error rates at the nominal level of α = 0.05 are given in Table ii. The kernel machine SNP-set test had an appropriate size for all the three kernels and all genes considered. As a benchmark, we also report the empirical Type 1 error rate for the single SNP-based min test, which also gave the correct size.\n\nFigure 1 plots the empirical power of the kernel machine SNP-set test (using the linear kernel) and the min test for the ASAH1 gene. The ASAH1 gene is on 8p22-p21.3 and consists of 86 HapMap SNPs and 14 typed SNPs on the Illumina HumanHap550 array. The SNP-set is formed by including only these 14 typed SNPs. In Figure 1, we allowed each of the 86 HapMap SNPs to be the true casual SNP one-at-a-time and computed the power of both the survival kernel machine SNP-set test and the min test. The ASAH1 gene region is made up of SNPs with a good correlation structure, in which the typed SNPs are typically in good LD with each other and with the causal SNPs. To understand better when the kernel machine method performs better than the min test, for each casual SNP, we calculated the median R2 (a commonly used LD measure) of the causal SNP with the typed SNPs using the program Haploview. From Figure 2, we can see that when the median R2 of the causal SNP with the typed SNPs is moderate, the kernel machine method always has higher power than the min test. Not surprisingly, when the median R2 of the causal SNP with the typed SNPs is low, both methods have low and comparable power at levels around the Type 1 error rate of 0.05. In Figure 3, we also plot the power of the IBS and weighted IBS kernel. The plot shows that even when the survival time is simulated assuming a linear model, a scenario where the linear kernel and min test are optimized, the IBS and weighted IBS kernel suffer from only a slight power loss.\n\nWe also investigated the conditions under which the min test has higher power than the kernel machine method using the NAT2 gene. NAT2 lies on 8p22 and has 22 HapMap SNPs and only 4 typed SNPs from the transcription start to end of the gene. The 4 typed SNPs are rs1390358, rs1112005, rs7832071 and rs1208 and are labeled as SNPs 7, 11, 13, 21 in Figure 4. The power of the kernel machine SNP-set test is higher than the min test for most SNPs. The power of the min test is higher than that of the kernel machine method at SNPs 2, 5, 9, 11, 20. A close examination of the LD plot will reveal that SNPs 2 (R2 = 0.83), 5 (R2 = 0.91), 9 (R2 = 0.99), 20 (R2 = 0.99) are in high LD with SNP 11 which is a typed SNP. Hence SNPs 2, 5, 9 and 20 will have similar results as SNP 11. Additionally, SNP 11 is also in weak LD with the remainder typed SNPs (R2 = 0.26 − 0.27). Hence when there is only a single true causal SNP that is typed and tested (or one in high LD with it is typed and tested) but not in LD with other typed SNPs, the min test might give higher power than the kernel machine method. However, such a setting is unlikely to happen frequently in an actual GWAS. In contrast, SNPs 7, 13 and 21 are in good LD with each other and when each of these SNPs are the true causal SNPs, the power of the kernel machine method is higher than the min test. For a much larger gene like FGFR2 (Figure 5), in regions of high LD, the kernel machine method again outperforms the min test. In regions of weak LD, the two methods have comparable power.\n\nTo illustrate how using MAF as weights in the weighted IBS kernel can upweight rare alleles, we present the empirical power for the HLA-B gene in Table iii. HLA-B gene is a part of a family of genes known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex and lies on 6p21.3. There are only 6 HapMap SNPs and 2 typed SNPs (rs1058026 and rs2523608) in the SNP-set. In Table iii, we simulated each of the 6 SNPs as the causal SNP. Since survival time was simulated by assuming a linear genetic effect, one would generally expect the power of the weighted IBS kernel to be no greater than that of the linear kernel, which corresponds to a Cox model with linear genetic effects of the SNPs. Of the two typed SNPs, rs1058026 and rs2523608, the former (0.118) has a lower MAF than the latter (0.478). When the SNP with the lower MAF was the causal SNP (rs1058026), the power of the weighted IBS kernel (0.358) was much greater than that of the linear kernel (0.214) and the IBS kernel (0.274). This is due to incorporating the information on the importance of rare variants into the kernel function. On the other hand, when the SNP with higher MAF was the causal SNP (rs2523608), the weighted IBS kernel (0.634) had a lower power than the IBS kernel (0.712) as the effect of the more common allele which is also the causal SNP was downweighted by the weighted IBS kernel.\n\nTable iv shows the power for testing for the ASAH1 gene effect using the different kernels in the presence of epistasis. In the cases studied, the IBS kernel always has the highest power, and the weighted IBS kernel has similar power. Both the linear kernel and min test suffer from substantial power loss, which is not surprising given that they mis-specify the model. These results are consistent when the causal SNPs are typed, and when the causal SNPs are untyped and are in good LDs with the typed SNPs.\n\nFor simulations using imputed data, the empirical Type 1 error rates at the nominal level of α = 0.05 were 0.0566 and 0.0404 for the linear kernel and min test respectively. Figure 6 shows the empirical power of the kernel machine SNP-set test using the linear kernel and the min test for the overall effect of the ASAH1 gene based on imputed data. The conclusions are similar to before, specifically for a gene with a good LD structure like ASAH1 gene, the kernel machine SNP-set test outperforms the min test."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nCharacteristics of study population\n\nOur study employed 436 metastatic melanoma patients (Table 1). Among these, 215 patients received anti-CTLA-4 (171 ipilimumab and 44 tremelimumab); 176 anti-PD-1 (17 nivolumab, 159 pembrolizumab) and 45 combination therapies (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1). For anti-CTLA-4, 150 samples were obtained from patients treated at NYULH; 50 at UCLA and 15 at MGH. For anti-PD-1, 77 samples were obtained from patients treated at NYULH, 84 at UCLA and 15 at MGH; while for combination therapy (anti-CTLA-4/antiPD-1), 34 samples were obtained from patients at NYULH and 11 at MGH (Table1). The overall median age at treatment was 62.85 years (range: 19-90.20). A larger proportion of our patients were males (67%), consistent with the sex distribution of metastatic melanoma. The response rate for combination therapy was the highest (76.74%). For anti-CTLA-4- treated patients, the overall response rate was 36.91 %, while anti-PD-1 had 52.04% response rate. Some statistically significant difference has been observed between treatment cohorts for age of treated patients (p=0.02) (Table 1). Therefore, in subsequent analyses the effect of SNPs on ICI efficacy was tested separately in anti-CTLA, anti-PD1 and combination-therapy treated cohorts.\n\nAnalysis of association of 25 autoimmune risk SNPs with response in anti-CTLA-4\n\nA total of 22 SNPs that passed QC (quality control) were tested for their association with response in 213 anti-CTLA-4 treated patients. Among those patients, 78 patients were responders (controls) and 135 were non-responders (cases) (Table 2). Both additive and recessive logistic regression models revealed several associations with response; however, none of these reached a level of statistical significance corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni adjustment (p<0.002) (supplementary Table S2), or a less stringent Holm-Bonferroni method. The most significant association with response in anti-CTLA-4-treated patients was found for rs1893217 under a dominant logistic model: our data showed that the carriers of at least one copy of a minor allele G (AG or GG) were 2.79 times more likely to be non-responders, compared to those with the homozygous reference genotype (AA) (95%CI= 1.36-5.73; p=0.005; Table 2). rs1893217 was mapped to the PTPN2 gene, and is associated with autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes (Supplementary Table S1). While this was the most significant association in the anti-CTLA-4 analysis, the statistical significance was marginal after adjustment for multiple testing by Bonferroni or Holm-Bonferroni methods (p-adjusted = 0.09). We also tested whether the association of rs1893217 with anti-CTLA-4 response was modified by age and sex and while the effect of rs1893217 was stronger in the younger age group (OR=6.43, 95% CI 1.7423.82), none of the interactions with age or sex was statistically significant (Figure S1).\n\nAnalysis of association of 25 autoimmune risk SNPs with response in anti-PD-1\n\nFor anti-PD-1 treatment, 24 SNPs passing QC were tested in 169 patients, of whom 88 were responders (controls) and 81 were non-responders (cases) (Table 2). An additive model revealed the most significant association with response for rs17388568 (OR=0.38; 95%CI=0.21-0.67; p=0.0008; Table 3; Full results in supplementary Table S2), significantly surpassing the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (p<0.002). Under the dominant regression model, consistent with the additive model, rs17388568 was found to have the strongest association with response (OR=0.26; 95%CI=0.12-0.53; p=0.0002; Table2), surpassing the Bonferroni multiple testing adjustment. In this analysis, carriers of at least one minor allele (GA or AA) of rs17388568 are 74% less likely to resist anti-PD-1 treatment, compared to those with GG genotype. rs17388568 was mapped to the genomic region containing IL2, ADAD1 and IL21, a locus previously associated with allergy, colitis and type 1 diabetes (Supplementary Table S1). The interaction analyses with age and sex for rs17388568 showed stronger effects in the younger female patients; yet, none of these associations was statistically significant (Figure S2).\n\nAnalysis of association of 25 autoimmune risk SNPs with response in combination therapy\n\nIn a cohort of 43 combination-therapy treated patients (N responders=controls=33, N non-responders=cases=10; Table2), none of the associations with the 23 SNPs tested reached statistical significance after adjustments for multiple testing with both the Bonferroni and Holm-Bonferroni methods (Full results Supplementary Table S2). However, due to the small sample size in the combination-therapy cohort, this analysis may have a limited power as evidenced by wide confidence intervals (Table2). Hence, the findings should be interpreted with caution. Finally, the pooled association analysis has been performed across treatments, grouping anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and combination-therapy treated patients together adjusted for age, sex and treatment drugs; no significant association with treatment response was observed (Supplementary Table S2)."

    "content": "Results\n\nEBNA2 binds chromatin at MS risk loci dependent on risk allele\n\nWe undertook ChIP for EBNA2 in 33 samples, analysing LCLs by an allele-specific ChIP-PCR method. As both alleles are available for binding of the transcription factor, by comparing the binding at both alleles within a sample heterozygous for a given SNP, these samples provide a natural internally matched control, with improved control for batch effects and technical variability, since the only variable that has changed is the allele. Of the six MS risk SNPs (all previously identified as eQTLs in LCLs, with evidence implicating EBNA2 binding) investigated, EBNA2 was found to bind dependent on MS risk allele at five loci (Fig. 2, p < 0·05). It bound preferentially to the risk allele of two loci, TRAF3/RCOR1 (rs1258869, p < 0·05) and CD40 (rs1883832, p < 0·05); and the protective allele of three loci, TNFAIP8 locus (rs32658, p < 0·001), TNFRSF1A locus (rs180069, p < 0·05) and TBX6 (rs3809627, p < 0·05) (two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test performed for all comparisons).\n\nEBNA2-TAT inhibits the EBV latency III growth program\n\nWe next investigated EBNA2-TAT effects on the LCL EBV latency III growth program since we previously reported LCL proliferation is associated with expression of several MS risk genes. We performed a dose-response experiment to find the optimal concentration of EBNA2-TAT that inhibits EBNA2 transcriptional function and affects MS risk genes without excess cytotoxicity. We treated LCLs with increasing concentrations of EBNA2-TAT over 24 hr. LCL proliferation was reduced significantly by all concentrations tested with 50µM reducing LCL proliferation by 40% (Fig. 3a, p < 0·01), 100µM by approximately 50% (p < 0·001), and 200µM by over 50% (p < 0·001) (two-tailed paired t-test). The cell morphology was also affected by increasing concentrations of EBNA2-TAT (Fig. 3b). Expression of the EBNA2 regulated EBV gene LMP1 was reduced significantly by EBNA2-TAT at 50µM at 24 hr (Fig. 3c, p < 0·05). The reduction in LMP1 was greater at 24 hr than at 48 hr (Supplementary Fig. 1) (two-tailed paired t-test). Taken together, this indicates significant disruption of the EBV latency III growth program by EBNA2-TAT 50 μM at 24 hr, and therefore these treatment conditions were chosen for the subsequent experiments. The cellular uptake of EBNA2-TAT and its specific binding to the RBP-Jκ site on EBNA2 has been previously confirmed through fluorescein labelling and in vitro GST affinity assay, respectively. We confirmed the previously shown finding that treatment with a mutant peptide of EBNA2-TAT (with a 2 amino acid substitution) had no inhibitory effects on EBNA2 function, no effects on cell viability or growth or have any effect cell morphology (Supplementary Fig. 3) indicating that inhibition of the EBNA2 interaction with RBP-Jκ is responsible for the effects of the EBNA2-TAT.\n\nInhibition of EBNA2 alters MS risk gene expression in LCLs\n\nWe next treated our cohort of 35 LCLs with the optimum treatment of EBNA2-TAT (50 µM for 24 hr). Of the seven MS-associated genes tested, gene expression of five was significantly affected by EBNA2 inhibition (Fig. 4), TRAF3 (p < 0·05), CD40 (p < 0·001), CLECL1 (p <0·0001), TNFAIP8 (p < 0·001), and TNFRSF1A (p < 0·001) (two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). Expression of two genes was not affected by EBNA2-TAT treatment: TBX6 and RCOR1. The reduced risk gene expression on EBNA2 inhibition for CD40, CLECL1 and TNFAIP8 suggests this transcription factor increases expression of these risk genes in LCLs. Conversely, these data suggest EBNA2 inhibits expression of TNFSF1A and TRAF3 in LCLs.\n\nThe effect of EBNA2 inhibition and the six MS risk loci on EBV DNA Copy number in LCLs\n\nEBV DNA copy number is a stable phenotype in LCLs. We previously demonstrated that several MS risk SNPs and genes are associated with EBV DNA copy number. We assessed the EBV DNA copy number for untreated and EBNA2-TAT treated LCLs (n=35). The TNFAIP8 locus demonstrated a genotype effect on EBV DNA copy number in untreated LCLs (Supplementary Fig. 5, p < 0·05, Mann-Whitney U test), and this genotype effect was ablated upon EBNA2-TAT treatment.\n\nIs the EBNA2 effect on gene expression at MS risk loci dependent on genotype?\n\nSince EBNA2 was demonstrated to bind one allele more than the other, we expected that EBNA2 would alter the allelic association with expression compared to that found in B cells. This was true for TRAF3, CD40, TNFAIP8, TNFRSF1A, TBX6 and RCOR1, but not CLECL1 (Fig. 5a). EBNA2 bound preferentially to the risk allele for TRAF3, and that allele had lower expression. It bound to the protective allele for CD40, TNFAIP8 and TNFRSF1A; and in each case that allele had relatively lower expression. However, from the effect of EBNA2-TAT inhibition on expression, we can deduce that EBNA2 increases the expression of CD40, CLECL1, and TNFAIP8; and decreases the expression of TRAF3 and TNFRSF1A. This suggests that while altering gene expression in one direction, it can alter the relative allelic expression in the same direction (TRAF3, TNFRSF1A) or in the alternate direction (CD40, TNFAIP8). The effect on expression due to EBNA2 preferential binding is the effect that would be expected to confer increased immune evasion if the EBNA2 binding is the basis for the increased MS risk.\n\nDoes the EBNA2 interaction with MS risk alleles increase host immune evasion?\n\nEBNA2 interacts with MS risk loci, dependent on genotype (Fig. 2). The direction of effect on risk gene expression can be inferred from the alteration in the relative allelic expression in LCLs compared to uninfected B cells (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 8). Each of these MS risk genes have putative functions in the EBV latency III program proximal to LMP1 and LMP2 signalling. On the basis of the inferred EBNA2 effect on expression and risk allele preference, we have postulated the effect of the EBNA2/risk gene interaction on the program, and so evasion of the host immune response (Fig. 5b). The effect of EBNA2/risk gene interaction is to increase gene expression (CLECL1, TNFAIP8, TNFRSF1A) or decrease expression (TRAF3, CD40, RCOR1), as described in Fig. 5b. In each case, there are plausible explanations for an enhanced EBNA2 function on the latency III infection cycle through its regulation of these risk genes."

By ethnicity, the risk-allele frequencies of rs3842787, rs20417, rs20118426 and rs1126643 were respectively 11.64%, 25.0%, 16.09% and 40.77% in Caucasian patients and 11.99%, 9.38%, 17.41% and 32.55% in Caucasian controls, and the corresponding frequencies were respectively 0.08%, 19.59%, 6.17% and 58.58% in Chinese patients and 10.82%, 12.62%, 3.88% and 28.69% in Chinese controls.\n\nOverall analyses\n\nTaking all available comparisons together for each polymorphism observed significant association of COX-2 gene rs20417 and ITGA2 gene rs1126643 with aspirin insensitivity, whereas no significance was found for COX-1 gene rs3842787 and ITGA2B gene rs201184269 under both allelic and dominant models (Table 3). For instance, risk estimates conferred by rs1126643-T allele reached as high as 2.37 (95% CI: 1.44–3.89; P = 0.001) for the occurrence of aspirin insensitivity relative to the alternative allele, and this estimation was more prominent under dominant model (OR = 2.81; 95% CI: 1.54–5.13; P = 0.001), despite marked between-study heterogeneity (P<0.01 for I 2) and low probability of publication bias as reflected by Egger's test (P>0.2). It is also worth mentioning that the significant association of rs20417 with aspirin insensitivity was immune from the disturbance of heterogeneity and publication bias. In addition, excluding comparisons with genotypes deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium yielded almost similar results (Table 3).\n\nSubgroup analyses\n\nTo estimate the influence of categorical confounders, separate analyses were performed within strata involving two or more comparisons (Table 3). By type of aspirin insensitivity, data were insufficient for rs3842787, rs20417 and rs20118426 to assess their associations with aspirin semi-resistance. For rs1126643, risk estimates was remarkably potentiated among patients with aspirin semi-resistance compared with those with aspirin resistance, especially under dominant model (aspirin semi-resistance: OR = 5.44; 95% CI: 1.42–20.83; P = 0.013 versus aspirin resistance: OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.07–3.6; P = 0.03). Heterogeneity was improved greatly for aspirin resistance comparisons.\n\nFurther grouping articles by ethnicity of study populations (mainly Chinese and Caucasian) observed the enhanced prediction of all examined polymorphisms except for rs20417 in Chinese compared with Caucasians (Table 3). Take rs1126643 for example, the odds of aspirin insensitivity in Chinese was nearly threefold relative to in Caucasians under both allelic (OR: 3.58 versus 1.29) and dominant (OR: 4.98 versus 1.49) models. However, a note of caution should be added because heterogeneity might potentially restrict the interpretation of risk estimates in Chinese (allelic model: I 2 = 76.5% and dominant model: I 2 = 51.0%).\n\nMeta-regression analyses\n\nTo further explore other potential sources of heterogeneity, a multivariable meta-regression model incorporating available study-level continuous covariates was conducted. Differences in percentage of CAD between patients and controls explained a large part of heterogeneity for rs20417 (P = 0.034). Moreover, averaged platelet number was a significant source of heterogeneity for rs1126643 (P = 0.012)."

    "content": "Results\n\nClinical presentation of three siblings\n\nThree siblings, born to consanguineous parents, were referred to the endocrine outpatient clinic at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City in Abu Dhabi for severe post-natal growth failure. The oldest sibling, patient 1 (P1), was conceived by in-vitro fertilization and born premature at 25 weeks but appropriate for gestational age (AGA) with a birth weight of 650-g and birth length of 30 cm. As a neonate, P1 was hospitalized for pneumonia with sepsis, requiring antibiotic treatments and supplemental oxygen. After discharge, she developed recurrent urinary tract and pulmonary infections, resulting in multiple hospitalizations that reduced in frequency with age and responded to antibiotics. She additionally had severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, feeding difficulties resulting in failure to thrive, and was developmentally delayed. P1 presented to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) at 4.8 years old with a GHI phenotype including severe short stature (height SDS −6.5), centripetal fat distribution, a prominent forehead, and a depressed nasal bridge. Atopic disease was present including eczema and reactive airway disease requiring corticosteroids. P1 was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and treated with levothyroxine. She additionally developed idiopathic thrombocytopenia at age 4 that resolved in months and recurred at age 7. She showed a temporarily positive treatment response to IVIG and dexamethasone, but platelet counts were normalized and sustained upon treatment with sirolimus. She did not develop ear, sinus, or skin infections or fungal infections. No lymphadenopathy was noted on physical exams.\n\nPatient 2 (P2) was born AGA at 37 weeks, weighing 2040-g. At the time of presentation, he was 2 years old with severe short stature and height SDS of −5.06, displaying a GHI phenotype similar to P1. P2 developed recurrent infections of the skin, urinary tract, and lungs requiring antibiotics and often supplemental oxygen. He presented with general lymphadenopathy at the time of evaluation. Similar to P1, chronic eczema and reactive airway disease developed. At presentation, P2 was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and treated with levothyroxine.\n\nPatient 3 (P3) presented at 7 months of age and was born AGA at 35 weeks, weighing 1900-g, but presented with severe short stature (height SDS −4.7) and facial dysmorphism. She had failure to thrive, and experienced recurrent skin and pulmonary infections requiring antibiotics and supplemental oxygen. P3 initially presented with atopic eczema and over the years of follow-up developed reactive airway disease. At age 2, she was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and treated with levothyroxine. P3 additionally had gastroesophageal reflux disease. No lymphadenopathy was noted.\n\nFamily history was negative for severe short stature that required medical attention, and both parents were of near-normal heights. When evaluated at CCHMC, the three siblings were placed on recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (rhIGF-1) to improve growth. The clinical presentation of these three siblings is outlined in Table 1.\n\nIdentification of novel homozygous nonsense STAT5B mutation in three siblings\n\nAt presentation, each sibling had normal serum GH levels and below-normal IGF-1, IGF-BP3, and acid labile subunit (ALS) concentrations, consistent with GHI. These abnormally low values and clinical phenotype prompted WES analysis of P1 at age 3.9. Trio clinical whole exome sequencing revealed 112,781 variants in P1, with only one candidate associated with growth and immune impairments, a homozygous variant in STAT5B, c.1892G>A, converting a tryptophan at position 631 to a nonsense residue, p.W631*. Other candidate variants can be found in Table S2. Sanger sequencing revealed heterozygosity in this STAT5B locus in both parents (Figure S1A), and sequencing of dermal fibroblast cultures from each sibling confirmed the presence of the mutation (Figure S1B). Interestingly, this novel mutation is adjacent to the first identified mutation in STAT5B, p.A630P (Figure S1C). The resulting protein lacks ~50% of the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, the critical phosphorylated tyrosine at position 699, and the entire transactivation domain (TAD).\n\nReconstitution analyses reveal impairments in the expression and function of the STAT5B p.W631* protein\n\nThe SH2 and TAD domains are critical for STAT5B activation, homodimer formation, and driving transcriptional activation. To evaluate the functional capacity of the STAT5B p.W631* mutation, we performed in vitro reconstitution analyses in HEK-GHRs. The truncated STAT5B p.W631* protein was significantly reduced in expression compared to wild-type FLAG-STAT5B (F-STAT5B WT) (Figure 1A and B). F-STAT5B WT, but not F-STAT5B p.W631*, was phosphorylated following GH treatment (Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence analyses revealed impaired nuclear localization of the F-STAT5B p.W631* protein following GH treatment (Figure 1C and D). Our results reveal reduced expression of the STAT5B p.W631* variant and an inability to be phosphorylated or traffic into the nucleus upon GH stimulation.\n\nSustained B cell hyperactivity is associated with atopy and autoimmunity in STAT5B deficient siblings\n\nThe identification of a LOF STAT5B variant in our patients prompted an evaluation of immune profiles. STAT5B deficient patients typically have reductions in the number of NK cells along with impaired function, and normal to elevated levels of B cells with increased immunoglobulin production. From infancy through early childhood, each sibling displayed normal numbers of NK cells (Table S1), B cells, and serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM (Table 2). Serum levels of IgE were consistently elevated in P1 and P2 (Table 2). These sustained elevations in IgE were associated with the development of chronic eczema and reactive airway disease, consistent with an atopic phenotype often associated with STAT5B deficiency. In early childhood, each sibling carried anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (Table 2).\n\nSTAT5B is important for the maintenance of T cell levels\n\nWhile immune defects associated with LOF STAT5B mutations vary, 7 out of 9 STAT5B deficient patients evaluated were moderately to severely T cell lymphopenic at the time of diagnosis. It remains unknown whether the systemic T cell reduction in these patients is due to impaired thymic T cell production or peripheral destruction. Studies of Stat5b−/− mice revealed normal levels of thymocytes and reduced splenocytes, while Stat5a−/−b−/− mice showed significant reductions in both thymocytes and splenocytes. To evaluate thymic output of T cells in the absence of functional STAT5B, levels of recent thymic emigrants (RTE) were assessed by quantification of CD4+CD45+CD31+ T cells. At 7 months of age, P3 displayed reduced RTEs that normalized the following year (Table 3). At 2 years of age, P2 displayed a low-normal RTE level that normalized over the following years. P1, who was evaluated at 4 years old, had normal RTEs throughout the evaluation.\n\nAnnual immune analyses did not reveal any alterations in total T cell levels, with the absolute number and total percentage of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells remaining within normal ranges in all three siblings (Table 3). The CD4:CD8 ratio also remained normal as previously reported. The normal levels of peripheral T cells from infancy to early childhood in the three young siblings suggest that STAT5B is likely dispensable for T lymphocyte development in these siblings, but may be important for long-term maintenance of T cell levels as older STAT5B deficient patients typically manifest T cell lymphopenia.\n\nSTAT5B may be responsible for the maintenance, rather than generation, of regulatory T cells\n\nRoles of STAT5B in IL-2 signaling include FOXP3 induction, Treg function, and self-tolerance in both humans and mice. Prior reports demonstrate reduced numbers and function of Tregs in STAT5B deficient patients; however, these evaluations were made when the patients were older and had already developed severe immune and pulmonary complications. In our younger patients, we annually evaluated the absolute numbers and total percentage of Tregs identified as CD4+ cells either expressing high levels of CD25 and low levels of CD127 (CD25+CD127low) or CD25 and FOXP3 (CD25+FOXP3+). Interestingly, the absolute number and total percentage of FOXP3+ Tregs were normal in P2 and P3 between the ages of 7 months and 5 years (Figure 2A–B, Figure S2). Reductions in Tregs were not consistently identified in P1 until age 8 (Figure 2A–C). However, the total percentage of CD4+CD25+CD127low T cells was reduced by the age of 3 years in each sibling (Figure 2D). These data suggest that the LOF STAT5B variant in these siblings impairs the maintenance of FOXP3 expression over time rather than the initial generation of FOXP3+ Tregs.\n\nPronounced dysregulation of memory CD8+ T cells in young STAT5B deficient siblings\n\nWhen evaluated, STAT5B deficient patients often have reduced naïve T cells and elevations in T cells with a memory/activation phenotype. Each of our siblings had modest but persistently reduced proportions of both CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T cells and elevated proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells (Figure S3, Figure S4A and B, Figure 3A and B). Evaluation of CD4+ T cell activation markers including CD69+, CD71+, CD40L+, CD134+, HLA+, and CD95+, were unremarkable (Table S1). The impact of STAT5B on memory T cell subsets including CD45RO+CCR7+ central memory (TCM), CD45RO+CCR7− effector memory (TEM), and CD45RA+CCR7− effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) were also evaluated in each sibling. CD4+ and CD8+ TCM cells remained within normal ranges (Figure S4C, Figure 3C). No alterations in the proportion CD4+ TEM cells were identified (Figure S4D), but increases in CD8+ TEM cell proportions became clinically significant with age in each sibling (Figure 3D). Elevations in the percentage of CD8+ TEMRA cells detected during infancy in P2 and P3 normalized around age 4 and remained normal in P1 (Figure 3E). A dysregulation of CD8+ T cells was noted despite normal CD4+ memory T cell subsets, an observation not previously reported for STAT5B deficiency. Our patients carried elevated proportions of CD8+ memory T cells beginning in infancy, suggesting a critical role for this LOF STAT5B variant in CD8+ T cell activation and homeostasis."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nIn the present study we utilized results from a previous investigation, namely, the sequencing‐based genotyping results of exon 2 in the HLA‐DRB1 and exons 2 and 3 in the HLA‐DQB1 genes of 359 ALL children with known ASP hypersensitivity status. 6  As a follow‐up cohort, a subset of these patients (n = 241) was enrolled. They were chosen based on the availability of their DNA samples. In the follow‐up cohort, we performed the genotyping of the 4 selected SNPs (Table 1) and investigated their potentials as predictors for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 carrier status (SNP‐genotyped subpopulation). Using the Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay the success rate of rs28383172 genotyping was 98%. Two patients had to be excluded due to the poor quality of their DNA samples; therefore, out of 241, a total of 233 patients were finally included in the analysis (Table 2). From the genotyping using KASPar‐on‐Demand prevalidated assays, genotypes were available for all 3 SNPs (rs2395182, rs4713586 and rs7775228) in all 233 patients. Based on the genotyping results, linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficients were calculated between the 4 SNPs in our population and based on the 1000 Genomes dataset in several super populations. As can be seen in Figures S1 and S2 there was LD between the investigated SNPs in all populations and the LD coefficients in the Hungarian population were most similar to those of in the EUR super population.\n\nBased on the literature, the genotypes determined for each SNP were classified as positive and negative predictors of HLA type separately (Supporting Information Table S1). We then evaluated the results as follows: (i) the association of rs28383172 AG or GG genotypes and HLA‐DRB1*07:01 carrier status; (ii) the association of rs28383172 AG or GG genotypes and HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status; (iii) the association of rs2395182 TT or TG and rs4713586 TT and rs7775228 TC or CC genotypes and HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status; (iv) patients meeting both the second and the third conditions were checked for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status; and (v) patients with rs28383172 AG or GG and rs7775228 TC or CC genotypes were examined for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carrier status (Supporting Information Table S2). The fifth algorithm was raised as a possible approach in data evaluation, during which we examined the contribution of each SNP in different combinations to positive prediction (Figure 1).\n\nThe performance of each test can be seen in Table 3. Carrying the G allele of rs28383172 was in perfect concordance with the HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele carrier status. Two‐thirds of the patients harbouring HLA‐DRB1*07:01 allele were HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype carriers. The rest of the patients did not carry the HLA‐DQB1*02:02 allele. Thus, algorithms II–V were designed to identify the same group of patients. The last of these, i.e. the 2‐SNP approach, seems to be the most suitable for clinical utilization with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values all greater than 95%.\n\nTo confirm our results in other populations, the performance of the different combinations of the tag SNPs was also assessed in the 1000 Genomes dataset. The results obtained for algorithm I were the same as those described by Erlichster et al. 8  For algorithm V, we found 100% sensitivity and >95% specificity in 3 out of 5 super populations, in AMR, EAS and EUR (Figure S3). The SNP combinations used for HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype‐tagging in algorithms III and IV did not achieve the performance required for validation in any super population.\n\nWe performed a pairwise comparison of the performance of algorithms II‐V on both the Hungarian and the 1000 Genomes data. In the Hungarian SNP‐genotyped subpopulation, specificity and the positive predictive value of algorithms III, IV and V were significantly higher compared to algorithm II, and, similarly, the specificity and the positive predictive value of algorithm IV were significantly higher compared to algorithm III, while the results of further comparisons were not found to be significant (Supporting Information Table S3). However, in the EUR super population, sensitivity and the negative predictive value of algorithm V, i.e. the 2‐SNP tagging, were significantly higher compared to algorithms III and IV. Besides, specificity and the positive predictive value of algorithm V were significantly higher compared to algorithm II. Overall, in the different comparisons on the 1000 Genomes dataset, the values of the different parameters of algorithm V were, in almost all cases, better than the values of algorithms II, III and IV (Figure S3).\n\nIn the SNP‐genotyped subpopulation, we evaluated the performance of the HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 and its surrogate markers as screening tests for E. coli ASP hypersensitivity (Table 4). The test identified a small proportion of affected patients (sensitivity value of 23.4%), but with good specificity (88.5%) and its positive and negative predictive values were 57.9 and 63.1%, respectively. We note that the performance measures of the HLA‐DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype and of its best tagger algorithm (V) were identical meanwhile, the latter is not a perfect predictor for the haplotype (i.e. the sensitivity and specificity of algorithm V to tag the haplotype were <100%). The reason for this seemingly contradictory result is that there were 2 patients for whom the tagger algorithm V missed the true haplotype carrier status (one in both directions), but neither had E. coli ASP hypersensitivity, and therefore they did not change the proportion of allergic patients."

    "content": "3. Results\n\nIn the present study, we enrolled 150 HIV-infected individuals and 158 healthy controls. The mean age (years ± SD) of HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls were 36 yrs ± 3.2 and 33 yrs ± 6.47, respectively. The demographic profile of HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls is shown in Table 1.\n\n3.1. Genotype-Phenotype Association\n\n3.1.1. TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) Polymorphism and HIV-Infected Individuals\n\nThe occurrence of TLR7 polymorphism in HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls is shown in Table 2. Polymorphisms rs179008 and rs179009 in TLR7 gene followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.07, 0.05) in healthy controls. The distribution of rs179009 AG genotype in the codominant model, rs179009 AG-GG genotype in the dominant model, and rs179009 AG genotype in the overdominant model was significantly reduced in HIV-infected individuals as compared to healthy controls (18.0% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23-0.77, P = 0.016; 26.7% vs. 36.7%, OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.30-0.89, P = 0.016, and 18% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23-0.77, P = 0.0039).\n\n3.1.2. TLR7 Haplotypes in HIV-Infected Individuals\n\nThe distribution of TLR7 haplotypes (rs179008 and rs179009) in HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls is shown in Table 3. In both polymorphisms, a nonsignificant association was observed in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D′) between HIV-infected individuals vs. healthy controls (D′: 0.2663). Haplotype AG (rs179008∗A/rs179009∗G) was found to be higher in HIV-infected individuals as compared to healthy controls (7.00% vs. 5.41%, OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.64-2.84, P = 0.43). Haplotypes AA, TA, and TG (rs179008∗A,∗T,∗T/rs179009∗A,∗A,∗G) were expressed almost similarly (75.33% vs. 72.44%, 14.33% vs. 16.8%, and 3.33% vs. 5.35%) (Table 3).\n\n3.1.3. TLR7 Polymorphism and HIV Disease Stages\n\nThe prevalence of TLR7 rs179009 AG genotype was observed less in early, intermediate, and advanced HIV disease stage individuals as compared to healthy controls (5.0% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.52, P = 0.001; 5.7% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.11-0.96, P = 0.04; and 4.7% vs. 29.1%, OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.03-0.39, P ≤ 0.001). Frequency of TLR7 rs179009 GG genotype was reduced in advanced HIV disease stage as compared with healthy controls (1.6% vs. 7.6%, OR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.01-1.07, P = 0.03) (Table 4).\n\n3.2. Gene-Environment Interaction\n\n3.2.1. TLR7 Polymorphism and Environmental Factors\n\nConsumption of tobacco and alcohol in HIV-infected individuals was analyzed for TLR7 polymorphism (Table 5). TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) polymorphisms did not differ between HIV-infected individuals with and without tobacco and alcohol users. The distribution of TLR7 rs179009AG genotype was found to be higher in tobacco-consuming HIV-infected individuals as compared to nonusers (26.1% vs. 17.2%, OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 0.52-5.49, P = 0.47). The prevalence of TLR7 rs179008 CC, CT, and TT genotypes was almost corresponding between tobacco-consuming HIV-infected individuals and nonconsuming (82.6% vs. 82.8%, 13.0% vs. 13.9%, and 4.3% vs. 3.3%). TLR7 rs179008 AA, AT, and TT and rs179009 AA, AG and GG genotypes distributed almost alike between alcohol taking HIV-infected individuals and nonusers (87.0% vs. 81.9%, 13.0% vs.14.2%, and 0.0% vs.3.9% and 78.3% vs. 72.4%, 17.4% vs. 18.1%, and 4.3% vs. 9.4%).\n\n3.2.2. Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis\n\nCorrelation of age, sex, tobacco, alcohol, baseline CD4 counts, and TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) polymorphisms with HIV disease progression was done by multivariate logistic regression analysis. TLR7 (rs179008 and rs179009) polymorphisms, age, sex, tobacco, alcohol usage, and baseline CD4 counts were not found as an independent risk factor for HIV disease progression (table not shown)."

    "content": "Results\n\nIdentification of ALK R1275Q Neoepitopes Using ProTECT\n\nA reduced version of our software, ProTECT (Figure 1), was initially run on a batch of six primary:relapsed NBL sample pairs from the TARGET cohort. We find at least one neoepitope-generating mutation persisting in the relapsed tumor for five of six patients (Table S1 and Supplementary Data S1 in Supplementary Material). Among these are two well-known hotspot mutations, NRAS Q61K and ALK R1275Q (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). We predicted two HLA-B*15:01-restricted decamer (MAQDIYRASY and AQDIYRASYY) and one nonamer (AQDIYRASY) neoepitopes arising from ALK R1275Q in sample TARGET-30-PARHAM. The predicted binding affinities are better than 0.55, 0.85, and 2.1%, respectively, relative to all peptides in a background training set (the top 5% ranked peptides are considered true binders by our method). While the peptide beginning at M1273 is predicted to be the top binder, the two epitopes beginning at A1274 are more promising from an immunological perspective since they are predicted to be significantly better binders to HLA-B*15:01 than their parental self-antigens ARDIYRASYY (10.75 percentile score) and ARDIYRASY (35 percentile score).\n\nUsing the full version of the ProTECT software (manuscript in preparation), we expanded our study to 100 primary NBL samples in the TARGET cohort to collect more complete statistics on ALK R1275Q-derived neoepitopes, and to identify other recurrent neoepitopes in NBL (Table S1 and Supplementary Data S2 and S3 in Supplementary Material). We identify four additional samples harboring ALK R1275Q (TARGET-30-PANWRR, -PANXJL, -PAPTFZ, and -PAPTLV). None of these samples express HLA-B*15:01, but sample PAPTFZ displays a close relative, HLA-B*15:03 that is predicted to bind ARDIYRASYY and ARDIYRASY with scores of 2.2 and 4.7%, respectively. Two samples (PANXJL and PAPTLV) express the high-frequency HLA-A*02:01 (20% in Caucasian populations), where an ALK R1275Q nonamer (GMAQDIYRA) is predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01 with a 1.4% score.\n\nAll but six of the 100 samples harbor one or more non-synonymous neoepitope with low percentile scores for at least one expressed HLA allele. Among these we identify other recurrent mutations, including the ALK mutation F1174L/I/C, present in 3/2/1 samples, respectively, and a ZNF717 mutation (Q716), present in three samples (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). One sample in the cohort expresses NRAS Q61K, an activating mutation commonly found in melanoma, thyroid, and colorectal cancers. Finally, the NRAS-derived neoepitope ILDTAGKEEY arising from a single mutation (Q61K) is predicted to bind the common HLA-A*01:01 allele with a statistically significant score of 0.35%. Notably, the same HLA-A*01:01/ILDTAGKEEY interaction identified by our method has been previously shown to elicit a specific T cell response using a melanoma cell line.\n\nALK Tumor Neoantigens Form p/MHC Complexes with Distinct Stabilities In Vitro\n\nThe results obtained from ProTECT analysis provide a range of therapeutically relevant neoantigen/HLA interactions to validate and characterize using biophysical and structural methods. Given the extensive genetic evidence supporting a role for ALK mutations in NBL tumors, we chose to pursue further the interaction between ALK R1275Q and HLA-B*15:01. We prepared recombinant HLA-B*15:01 bound to the two ALK-derived neoantigens, a nonamer (AQDIYRASY) and a decamer (AQDIYRASYY). As a control, we attempted to prepare HLA-B*15:01 with the self-antigen (ARDIYRASY), which is predicted to have a >10-fold reduced binding affinity for the HLA. Peptide/MHC samples were refolded from purified Escherichia coli inclusion bodies in the presence of 10-fold molar excess peptide using standard methods and purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC traces of the nonamer and decamer samples show three distinct peaks corresponding to protein aggregate (22.8 min), p/MHC complex (29.5 min), and free β2m (42.7 min) (Figure 2A). Notably, the sample refolded using the self-antigen peptide shows only two peaks in the chromatogram, none of which contain non-aggregated p/MHC molecules (Figure 2A, green trace), further suggesting that the affinity of the self-antigen is insufficient to promote the formation of a stable complex with the HLA.\n\nTo confirm the presence of the neoepitopes in the two MHC samples, we performed liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy (LC–MS). LC–MS reveals a high relative abundance of the correct peptide in each sample, with observed masses of 1,086.70 and 1,249.71 Da, which agree well with the expected masses of the nonamer and decamer, respectively (Figures 2B,C). Thus, we confirm binding of the two tumor neoepitopes to recombinant HLA-B*15:01 prepared through in vitro refolding. To further characterize the resulting p/MHC molecules, we used a differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay, which can accurately assess kinetic stability. According to this technique, properly folded class I p/MHC complexes show melting temperatures (Tm) from 37 to 63°C, which correlate with predicted IC50 values in the micromolar to nanomolar range. Here, both neoantigen p/MHC samples show a clear unfolding transition with a highly reproducible Tm of 53.4°C for the nonamer and 59.3°C for the decamer complex (Figure 2D), suggesting that the decamer forms a higher affinity complex with HLA-B*15:01. Such a difference in thermal stabilities of the p/MHC complexes together with previous observations that peptide length influences its conformation within a fixed-length groove is consistent with a hypothesis that the two peptides are displayed via distinct binding modes, as previously reported for nonamer and decamer peptides sampling unique conformations within an MHC groove.\n\nStructural Plasticity within the MHC Peptide-Binding Groove Enables Distinct Neoantigen Conformations\n\nTo elucidate the structural basis underlying the distinct stabilities observed for the two ALK neoepitopes and to further characterize peptide features displayed to TCRs we solved the X-ray structures of the nonamer (HLA-B*15:01/β2m/AQDIYRASY) (PDB ID 5TXS) and the decamer complex (HLA-B*15:01/β2m/AQDIYRASYY) (PDB ID 5VZ5). The nonamer complex crystallized in the P212121 space group at a resolution of 1.7 Å, while the decamer complex crystallized in the P6122 space group at a resolution of 2.6 Å (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). The nonamer peptide adopts a canonical extended conformation promoted by the N-terminal (Ala1, Gln2) and C-terminal (Tyr9) anchors, which are deeply embedded within A/B, and F-pockets of the HLA groove (Figures 3A,B), respectively. This anchoring results in a “curved” conformation, where the backbone of residues from Asp3 to Ser8 is pushed toward the upper part of the groove while the remaining residues are maintained within the C, D, and E pockets (Figure 3B). A survey of previously deposited HLA-B*15:01-restricted antigens in the PDB (LEKARGSTY derived from Epstein–Barr virus, PDB ID 1XR8; ILGPPGSVY derived from human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme-E2, PDB ID 1XR9; VQQESSFVM derived from SARS coronavirus, PDB ID 3C9N) reveals other nonamer epitopes consistently in extended conformations, in agreement with the conformation of the ALK nonamer neoepitope in our X-ray structure (Figures S4A–D in Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the overall architecture of the B*15:01-binding groove is similar between the different structures with heavy atom backbone RMSDs of less than 1 Å (Figure S4E in Supplementary Material). Comparison between the peptide amino acid sequences reveals excellent agreement with the established HLA-B*15:01-binding motifs, where LMQ/AEISTV and FY/LM are preferred/tolerated in anchor positions 2 and 9, respectively (Figures S4F,G in Supplementary Material). Thus, the X-ray structure of our ALK-derived nonamer neoepitope is consistent with established structural features in the PDB, suggesting a trend where the peptide backbone conformation is defined by its length and anchor motifs.\n\nGenerally, peptides of length greater than nine amino acids either bulge further out of the binding groove or form a “zig-zag” conformation. However, in our decamer complex structure (Figures 3C,D), the peptide adopts a short 310 helical backbone conformation from Ile4 to Ala7, as confirmed by an inspection of φ/ψ backbone dihedral angles (Figure S1A in Supplementary Material). Notably, while the N-terminal anchor residues are identical in the nonamer and decamer peptide, Tyr10 of the decamer replaces Tyr9 of the nonamer as the C-terminal anchor residue in a similar conformation (Figures 3B,D). The accommodation of a longer peptide sequence within the fixed-size MHC groove is thus achieved through the formation of a more compact 310 helix for the decamer, relative to the extended nonamer backbone. In addition, the 310 helix buries Arg6 further into the MHC groove and creates an amphipathic structure where Ile4, Tyr5, Ser8, and Tyr9 are oriented toward the solvent (Figure 3D). A structural superposition of the nonamer and decamer peptides (2.7 Å backbone heavy atom RMSD) highlights the changes in residues that are oriented toward the solvent, suggesting that the two epitopes display very different surface features for interactions with TCRs (Figures 3E–G).\n\nThe compaction of the peptide backbone in the decamer structure is accompanied by structural adaptations of MHC residues in the peptide-binding groove. In particular, in the decamer complex the HLA α2 helix undergoes a significant widening involving a 5.1 Å displacement of the Cα atom of Arg151. This movement is driven by a change in orientation of Arg151, which points toward the solvent in the nonamer versus toward the groove in the decamer complex (Figures S2A,B in Supplementary Material), and the burying of Arg6 further toward the floor of the groove. Thus, the addition of a C-terminal Tyr in the peptide sequence drastically alters the tertiary structure of the HLA complex, driven by a widely different peptide conformation that can be accommodated through conformational plasticity within a malleable MHC groove.\n\nKey structural parameters extracted from our crystallographic analysis provide insights into the increased stability of the decamer/HLA complex. Notably, the buried surface area (BSA) between HLA-B*15:01 and the decamer peptide is 1,986 Å2, relative to 800 Å2 in the nonamer structure. To further dissect different structural features for their contributions to p/MHC stability, we analyzed all polar (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and electrostatic interactions) and hydrophobic interactions involving HLA residues (Figure S5 and Table S3 in Supplementary Material). Specifically, the decamer peptide forms additional intra-peptide hydrogen bonds as a result of the more compacted 310 helix conformation. In addition, the decamer participates in 25 polar and 21 hydrophobic interactions with the MHC residues, while the nonamer forms 26 polar but only 11 hydrophobic interactions with the groove (Figure S5A in Supplementary Material). Specifically, Asp3 and Arg6 of the decamer peptide extend further into the groove, forming additional contacts with HLA side chains (Figures S5B,C in Supplementary Material). Our structural analysis suggests that an increase in the total number of intra-peptide hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic packing interactions, consistently with an increase in BSA brought on by the more compact 310 helical conformation, leads to an improved stability of the decamer complex, as confirmed independently by our DSF experiments (Figure 2B).\n\nStructural Exclusion of the Self-antigen from the HLA-B*15:01 Groove\n\nTo further evaluate the potential immunogenicity of the ALK R1275Q neoepitopes, we compared their affinity for HLA-B*15:01 relative to the self-peptide (ARDIYRASY). Formation of a stable HLA complex displaying the self-peptide would compromise the therapeutic relevance of any related neoantigen, due to immune tolerance mechanisms that limit the repertoire of responsive T cells. Preliminary attempts to refold HLA-B*15:01 using a synthetic nonamer peptide with the parental ALK sequence did not result in efficient p/MHC formation, suggesting low binding affinity, likely in the micromolar range (Figure 2A, green trace). To further explore the basis of this exclusion we performed structural modeling of the self-peptide/HLA-B*15:01 complex, using our solved X-ray structure of the nonamer complex as a template. We find that performing the reverse Gln to Arg substitution leads to steric hindrance between the longer Arg2 side chain and residues of the MHC-binding groove (Figure S6A in Supplementary Material). Despite a careful consideration of all possible Arg side-chain rotamers, significant clashes remain with Ser67 on the α1 helix, as well as with Ala24, Met45 on the floor of the MHC groove (Figure S6A in Supplementary Material). As expected from the conservation of peptide residue anchors in the A- and B-pockets, we observe similar clashes when the self-decamer is modeled with HLA-B*15:01. By contrast, the neoepitope Gln2 side chain fits well into the B-pocket, forming an additional hydrogen bond Tyr9 from the HLA heavy chain (Figure S6B in Supplementary Material, cyan dotted line). Finally, we performed detailed structure modeling calculations using simultaneous optimization of the peptide backbone in addition to the side-chain degrees of freedom and ranked the calculated affinities of the three peptides for HLA-B*15:01 according to a physically realistic energy function. The self-antigen complexes yield the least favorable binding energies, followed by the nonamer, and finally the decamer complex (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). Thus, our structural analysis is highly consistent with our in vitro results, i.e., that the self-peptide is excluded from binding, in sharp contrast with the nonamer and decamer neoepitopes which form tight complexes with the HLA.\n\nEvaluating the HLA-Binding Repertoire Using Comparative Modeling Calculations\n\nA patient’s HLA haplotype plays a major role in determining the outcome of targeted cancer immunotherapies. Therefore, toward expanding the range of individuals that could mount a T cell response to ALK R1275Q neoepitopes, we evaluated the potential of other HLAs to display the two peptides in silico. Here, we developed and applied a high-throughput approach which exploits the availability of our high-resolution X-ray structures for the two neoepitopes to simultaneously predict peptide/HLA interactions and surface features of peptide residues poised for interactions with TCRs. First, we selected a non-redundant set of 2,904 HLA alleles (885 HLA-A, 1,405 HLA-B, and 614 HLA-C unique sequences) from the EMBL-EBI database. We then carried out detailed Rosetta comparative modeling calculations for each allele, using our experimentally determined HLA-B*15:01 structures for the nonamer and decamer ALK peptides as templates (Figure 4). In contrast to previous structure-based peptide/HLA modeling methods which use a flexible peptide docking approach, we used a fixed-peptide backbone threading approach followed by energy minimization of the interacting peptide and HLA residues to drastically confine the docking degrees of freedom. Our approach was motivated the observation that the peptide backbone conformation shows minimal variance (less than 1.5 Å RMSD) in all nonamer/HLA-B*15:01 structures reported in the PDB (Figure S4E in Supplementary Material). Using this strategy, we extracted highly reproducible binding energies for both the nonamer and decamer peptides, which are maintained in extended and 310 helical conformations, respectively, in the resulting models (Figure S7 in Supplementary Material). As expected, the HLA-B*15 alleles rank systematically among the top binders, indicating a high degree of groove complementarity to both peptides (Figure 5; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, purple). Among those, the HLA-B*15:84 allele shows the lowest binding energy for the decamer (Figure 5A, black circle), whereas the HLA-B*15:107 allele shows the lowest binding energy for the nonamer (Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, black circle). A total of 116 HLA alleles from all A, B, and C types exhibit lower binding energies for both the nonamer and decamer peptides than our initial HLA-B*15:01 structural templates (Figure 5A; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, red square), suggesting the potential for a broader HLA display repertoire.\n\nTo elucidate a sequence bias for specific residues in the HLA-binding groove that consistently yield more favorable interactions with the two peptides, we analyzed the average binding energy as a function of sequence identity score, calculated relative to the best binding allele for each peptide (Figure 4). As a negative control, we computed the binding energy for a mock HLA allele in which all residues in the MHC-binding groove are mutated to Ala. As expected, the mock polyAla HLA exhibits a low binding affinity (i.e., high-binding energy) to the peptide and is distant from the best binding allele (Figure 5; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material, green triangle, top left). We observe an evident correlation between the computed binding energies and sequence similarity to the top binder. Our approach additionally allows us to decompose residue specific contributions to overall binding energy for each peptide–HLA combination. We find a clear trend for both the nonamer and decamer peptides with a set of HLA alleles where a bulk of the binding energy is provided by the “anchor” positions (Figures S11A,B in Supplementary Material). By contrast, the mock polyAla HLA exhibits considerably higher binding energy across the entire peptide length (Figures S11A,B in Supplementary Material). To elucidate key sequence features that allow the peptides to be accommodated in the MHC groove, we derived a sequence profile among good binders for the two neoepitopes. Such features are highlighted in the Kullback–Leibler sequence logo, which reveals preferred residues in the HLA peptide-binding groove (Figure 5B; Figure S8B in Supplementary Material). According to this metric, highly invariant residues in the MHC-binding groove should play an essential role in mediating peptide/MHC interactions, as they are consistently observed in HLA alleles that exhibit high affinity binding. A close inspection of our structural models for the nonamer and decamer bound to a common allele in our data set, HLA-A*01:01, reveals similar polar contacts, primarily in the A-, B-, and F-pockets, that correlate well with the positions of invariant MHC residues (Figures 5C,D; Figures S8C,D in Supplementary Material). Specifically, both the nonamer and decamer C-terminal anchors employ a similar interaction pattern in the F-pocket with conserved Thr, Lys, Trp, and Tyr residues of the MHC (Figures 5B,D; Figure S8B,D in Supplementary Material).\n\nTo test the validity of our structure-based simulations, we performed in vitro refolding of the ALK-derived nonamer and decamer peptides with HLA-A*01:01. This allele was chosen because it is a high-frequency allele in multiple populations worldwide and has been previously shown to form stable recombinant p/MHC complexes for structural characterization. As observed in our previous experiments with HLA-B*15:01 (Figure 2A), refolding of HLA-A*01:01 with decamer or nonamer peptide results in a stable p/MHC complex (Figures S8E and S9A in Supplementary Material). Further characterization of the purified complex reveals a thermal stability of 47.9°C for the decamer (Figure S9B in Supplementary Material) and 46.7°C for the nonamer (Figure S8F in Supplementary Material), suggesting that both ALK neoepitopes have a lower affinity for HLA-A*01:01 compared with HLA-B*15:01 (Figure 2D, 59.3°C), consistently with our binding energy calculations (Figure 5A; Figure S8A in Supplementary Material). Although certain HLA and H2 MHC alleles have been previously reported to yield partially folded, peptide-free molecules with measurable thermal stabilities, control refolding experiments performed without peptide for each of our HLA alleles failed to yield a stable complex. Finally, to conclusively test the atomic features predicted by our simulations, we determined the X-ray structure of decamer complex HLA-A*01:01/β2m/AQDIYRASYY (PDB ID 6AT9). The decamer complex crystallized in the P32221space group at a resolution of 2.9 Å (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). Inspection of crystallographic φ/ψ dihedral angles reveals that the peptide backbone also adopts a short 310 helix conformation when bound to HLA-A*01:01, suggesting that the peptide length is the main determinant of its conformation in the groove, and further justifying our fixed-backbone modeling approach (Figure S9F in Supplementary Material). The peptide conformation in the X-ray structure shows excellent agreement with our Rosetta model (1.1 backbone heavy atom RMSD), with several high-resolution features predicted by the model are confirmed by the X-ray, including polar contacts within both the A- and F-pockets of the MHC groove (Figures 5C–F; Figure S12 in Supplementary Material). Specifically, the side-chain hydroxyl group of the peptide Tyr10 is in contact with the same Tyr, Lys, and Trp side-chain atoms from the F-pocket (Figures 5D,F). Finally, in comparison with the X-ray structure of the same peptide bound to HLA-B*15:01, the side chain of Arg6 is flipped outwards from the groove when bound to HLA-A*01:01 altering the peptide surface displayed to TCRs (Figures S9D,E in Supplementary Material). Thus, our independent X-ray structure corroborates the trend observed in our structure-based binding energy simulations and further supports the potential for other HLA molecules to display the recurrent ALK neoepitopes with unique TCR interaction properties.\n\nThe Two ALK-Derived Neoepitopes Are Recognized by CD8+ T Cells\n\nGiven the unique conformations and surface features observed for the nonamer and decamer peptides, we sought to determine whether the two altered-self (i.e., mutated) neoantigens could be recognized by CD8+ T cells using a MHC tetramer staining assay followed by multichannel flow cytometry analysis. We hypothesized that an HLA-matched donor would be able to recognize altered-self neoepitopes in the periphery, as long as the peptide adopts a conformation that can potentiate interactions with TCRs. To test this, we acquired PBMCs from two HLA-B*15:01-matched healthy donors. For each peptide, we performed a double staining experiment using HLA-B*15:01 tetramers conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC) or phycoerythrin (PE), toward identification of T cells that recognize each neoepitope. Final cell sorting using fluorescence-based detection results in identification of double positive populations with a total of 0.012% CD8+ T cells reactive to the nonamer (Figure S13A in Supplementary Material), and 0.024% reactive to the decamer epitope (Figure S13B in Supplementary Material). Notably, these findings were very similar between two independent staining experiments using PBMCs from individual donors (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material). As a control, we additionally performed staining experiments using tetramers made for HLA-B*15:01 complexed with an immunodominant SARS coronavirus-derived epitope (VQQESSFVM). For double staining experiments with HLA-B*15:01/SARS tetramers, we observe double positive populations corresponding to 0.007 and 0.014% reactive CD8+ T cells (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material). Finally, simultaneous staining experiments using nonamer/HLA-B*15:01-PE and decamer/HLA-B*15:01-PE tetramers did not uncover populations of CD8+ T cells that recognized both epitopes (Figure S13C in Supplementary Material). Thus, CD8+ T cells are able to recognize both neoepitopes with nominal frequencies that are comparable to that of a known immunodominant epitope."

    "content": "Results\n\nGWAS meta-analysis of IgM anti-PC\n\nAfter phenotype and genotype matching, individuals with both IgM anti-PC measurements and genotypes available were used in this study (Table 1). Among the three individual discovery GWAS of IgM anti-PC, one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs74420772 in 3p14.1 achieved genome-wide significance in TwinGene (P = 2.7 × 10−8), whereas no genome-wide significant SNPs were observed in the other two studies (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). In the discovery phase meta-analysis of these three GWAS results (total n = 3002), two SNPs in 1p31.3 and six SNPs in 11q24.1 achieved genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 × 10™8, Fig. 1A; Supplementary Material, Table S1), with negligible inflation of the signal from population stratification or other sources, lambda (λ) = 1.001 (Fig. 1B). Validation of the eight associated SNPs from the discovery GWAS meta-analysis was sought in the fourth cohort (n = 646). The two SNPs in 1p31.3 were not significant (P ≥ 0.164), but all of the six SNPs in 11q24.1 were successfully replicated (P < 6.5×10−3, Supplementary Material, Table S2). On the basis of all four studies, the allelic effect size (β) of the leading SNP rs35923643-G in 11q24.1 was 0.19 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13–0.24, P =4.3 × 10−11] rank order normalized standard deviation (SD) of IgM anti-PC per allele (Table 2; Supplementary Material, Table S3). These six SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) within a 131 kb block that overlaps with the GRAM domain containing 1B (GRAMD1B) gene (Fig. 1C). The mean levels of IgM anti-PC in the genotype groups of rs35923643 (and its proxy SNP rs735665) are presented in Supplementary Material, Table S4.\n\nPolygenic risk score analysis\n\nThe allele rs35923643-G (or its proxy SNP rs735665-A, r 2 = 1, D′ = 1) has also been recognized as the top risk allele for CLL, as judged by the latest meta-analysis of six GWASs of CLL. In the latest GWAS of general immunoglobulin levels, rs735665-A was also found to be a main genetic variant specific for general IgM, rather than general IgA and general IgG. The shared genetic variants were investigated in polygenic risk score (PRS) and correlation analyses by using the summary GWAS results of IgM anti-PC (from our discovery meta-analysis), IgM [SNPs with association P < 1×10−6 from Jonsson et al. ] and CLL [from the InterLymph consortium ].\n\nPRSs on the basis of general IgM increasing alleles were positively associated with IgM anti-PC, with β close to 0.5 and P < 5 × 10−6 across all tested P-value threshold quantiles (Fig. 2A). Eight of the nine genome-wide significant SNPs for general IgM were identified in our IgM anti-PC GWAS, in which rs2476601 (P = 0.007) and rs735665 (P = 3.1 × 10−8) achieved nominal significance (Fig. 2B).\n\nPRSs on the basis of IgM anti-PC increasing alleles were associated with higher risk of CLL. Across the 5000 quantiles including genome-wide SNPs with gradually increasing association P-value with IgM anti-PC, the quantile only including the SNP rs735665 was best-fitted and explained the largest variance of CLL (Nagelkerke r 2 = 0.006, P = 1.2×1015, Fig. 2C). All of the 33 independent genome-wide significant SNPs for CLL were identified in our IgM anti-PC GWAS, in which rs9392504 (P = 0.04) and rs735665 (P = 3.1 × 10−8) achieved nominal significance (Fig. 2D).\n\nPRSs on the basis of increasing alleles for general IgM (across quantiles with gradually increasing threshold for association P-value, from P < 5.0 × 10−10 to P < 1.0 × 10−6) were associated with lower risk of CLL (Supplementary Material, Table S5). There were 43 independent SNPs (association P-values with general IgM was lower than 5.0 × 10−8) in the best-fitted quantile, explaining 0.003 of the variance of CLL risk with an odds ratio of 0.69 (95% CI 0.55–0.83, P = 4.2 × 10−8).\n\nFunctional prediction\n\nThe potential function of the variants in the top locus 11q24.1 shared between IgM anti-PC and CLL is not known. The LD block that rs35923643 located was scanned for regulatory marks in leukemia- or immune-cell lines (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). Peaks of histone mark monomethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4Me1) (in GM12878) and deoxyribonuclease I (DNaseI) hypersensitivity (in GM12878, CD34+ and GM12865) were found at the position of rs35923643 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3A and B).\n\nIn the chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), there were suggested binding sites for 22 different transcription factors (TFs) within the ~700bp region around rs35923643 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3C). Among the matched sequences from Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO) tool, the strongest signals were observed for Runt-related TF 3 (RUNX3) and SPI1 (Supplementary Material, Table S6). The RUNX3 binding motifs include the SNP rs35923643 (at the position of 391 bp), in which Haib_RUNX3_GM12878_Motif1_ fw_ic0 was from a B-cell line. Switching from the major allele T/A at rs35923643 to the minor C/G allele impeded the predicted binding affinity of RUNX3, making the P-value (defined as probability of match for a random sequence with the same length) to increase 10-fold (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3D).\n\nThe RegulomeDB database also gave support for rs35923643 to affect the binding of TFs in general (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Taken together, the results indicate that rs35923643 may be a more likely candidate to be the functional variant rather than rs735665 that has been frequently reported for CLL.\n\nPhenotypic association between IgM anti-PC and CLL\n\nIn a small nested case–control study (7 prevalent CLL cases, 23 incident CLL cases, with 3 age- and sex-matched controls for each case), we found IgM anti-PC to be lower in prevalent CLL cases than in matched controls (P = 0.006); although it was not different between incident CLL cases and their matched controls (P = 0.227, Table 3). No association between IgM anti-PC and incident CLL risk estimated from the stratified Cox proportional hazards model (P = 0.354). Moreover, we tested whether the difference of IgM anti-PC levels between CLL cases and the matched controls was dependent on the time between sampling and diagnosis. There was a declining but not statistically significant trend (β = –0.08, P = 0.10, Fig. 3; Supplementary Material, Fig. S5)."
