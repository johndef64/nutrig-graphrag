This suggests that genetic predisposition plays a crucial role in an individual's susceptibility to these conditions. For example, individuals carrying the rs7903146 risk allele (T-allele) often exhibit higher BMI at baseline compared to those with the protective CC genotype. Moreover, this variant has been shown to modify the effect of dietary factors on type 2 diabetes risk. Notably, studies indicate that individuals with the rs7903146 CC genotype who consume higher fiber intake have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with the T-allele. Conversely, the presence of the T-allele may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes even when dietary factors are considered.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Dietary Fiber Intake Modifies Genetic Risk\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The community emphasizes the importance of dietary choices, particularly fiber intake, in mitigating the influence of genetic predispositions.
