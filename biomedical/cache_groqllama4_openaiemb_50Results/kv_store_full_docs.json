    "content": "Results\n\nPhenotype definition\n\nAll cohorts used self-report questionnaires containing ≥70 food items. Average intakes were highly similar across cohorts (Supplementary Table 1.2). Using these self-reports, we calculated the relative contributions of fat, protein, carbohydrate, and sugar to total energy intake. When possible, we excluded individuals on calorie- or macronutrient-restricted diets (see Supplementary Table 1.3 for all exclusion criteria).\n\nWe do not study total energy intake because it is mainly determined by body size and physical activity, and because systematic underreporting of total energy intake is correlated with BMI. We caution that selective underreporting of macronutrients could be problematic for the common approach we adopt of studying relative intake, but there is mixed evidence for this, and its consequences are poorly understood (Supplementary Information 2.4).\n\nSince macronutrient intake may not scale linearly with total energy intake, we developed and applied a method that adjusts for observed non-linear relationships (Supplementary Information 2.6–2.8, Extended Data Fig. 1). Consistent with the satiating properties of protein, we find that relative protein intake declines at higher levels of total energy intake, while relative fat intake increases, and relative sugar and carbohydrate intake remain roughly constant (Supplementary Table 2.3).\n\nMain results\n\nGWAS were performed in individuals of European ancestries from over 14 population cohorts. Informed consent was obtained by the cohorts for all participants included in the analyses. Association statistics underwent rigorous quality control according to SSGAC guidelines, which included sample-size-dependent quality-control filters, exclusion of SNPs with too small standard errors or too large explained phenotypic variance, and visualizations of summary statistics and allele frequencies (Supplementary Information 3.3, Supplementary Tables 3.1–3.5). Our discovery sample is the subset of the UKB with survey data on dietary intake (N = 175,253). The replication phase consists of a meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics from 14 additional cohorts that followed our analysis plan (N = 60,138) together with summary statistics from DietGen (for fat, protein, and carbohydrate, N = 33,531, flowchart in Extended Data Fig. 2). DietGen assumed a linear scaling of macronutrients with total energy intake. Nonetheless, we included DietGen in our meta-analysis because the genetic correlations between DietGen and our other replication cohorts are not significantly different from one at P < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 4.1).\n\nThe discovery stage identified 21 approximately independent genome-wide-significant lead SNPs (see Supplementary Information 3.3.5 for a description of the clumping algorithm): 4 for fat, 5 for protein, 5 for sugar, and 7 for carbohydrate (Supplementary Table 4.2). These lead SNPs partially overlap across phenotypes and reside in 14 unique loci. In the replication stage, all 21 lead SNPs had the anticipated signs and comparable effect sizes (Extended Data Fig. 3), and 15 reach statistical significance at P < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 4.2). This empirical replication record matches or exceeds theoretical predictions that take into account the statistical winner’s curse, sampling variation, and statistical power (Supplementary Table 4.1). In our data, the association between DRAM1 and dietary intake reported by Merino et al. does not replicate, with a discordant effect size compared to Merino et al. (, SE = 0.025 compared to Merino et al.’s, SE = 0.02 in phenotypic standard deviations per effect allele, Supplementary Table 4.3).\n\nIn order to maximize statistical power, all follow-up analyses below are based on the combined discovery and replication samples (N = 235,391–268,922, Supplementary Information 5). The quantile–quantile plots exhibit substantial inflation (λGC = 1.12–1.19, Extended Data Fig. 4). The estimated intercepts from LD Score (LDSC) regressions suggest that the vast majority of this inflation is due to polygenic signal, and only a small share is attributable to population stratification (the maximum estimate, ~6%, is for fat and is not statistically distinguishable from 0% at P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 5.1). The number of approximately independent lead SNPs in the combined sample is 36 (pairwise r2 < 0.01), including 6 for fat, 7 for protein, 10 for sugar, and 13 for carbohydrate (Table 1, Fig. 1). These 36 reside in 21 unique loci (Supplementary Table 5.4). Fourteen lead SNPs are uniquely associated with one macronutrient at genome-wide significance (P < × 10−8), while five of these reach suggestive significance (P < 1 × 10−5) for at least one other macronutrient. The SNP effect sizes range from 0.015 to 0.098 phenotypic standard deviations per allele. The phenotypic variance explained per SNP, expressed in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), ranged from 0.011% to 0.054%, the same order of magnitude as the R2’s of the most strongly associated lead SNPs for other genetically complex traits such as BMI and educational attainment (Extended Data Fig. 5).\n\nMAGMA gene-based analyses of our GWAS summary statistics identifies 81 unique genes (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 5.5). While the majority of these genes are near our lead SNPs, MAGMA also identifies 33 genomic regions harboring 44 unique genes that are physically distant (>1 Mb) from our lead SNPs.\n\nDiscussion of lead SNPs from combined meta-analysis\n\nSeven of the 21 lead SNPs had not been (directly or via LD partners, r2 ≥ 0.6 and distance <250 kb) associated with any other traits in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog at the time of query (September 19, 2017) (Supplementary Table 5.6). Each of these seven SNPs is located in or near genes that have not been studied in depth to date.\n\nFive lead SNPs are located in or near genes that have well characterized biological functions in nutrient metabolism or homeostasis but have not previously been associated with dietary intake. First, we find that a missense variant in APOE (rs429358) is associated with fat, sugar, and carbohydrate, where the allele that decreases Alzheimer’s risk is associated with greater relative fat and lower relative sugar and carbohydrate intakes. In addition to its strong association with Alzheimer’s disease, APOE is known to be involved in fatty acid metabolism. We explored whether the associations in our data may be driven by sample selection. Specifically, older people with dementia may be systematically missing from the UKB, and unaffected elderly people may have different eating habits than younger people. To test for this possibility, we examined the subsample of UKB participants aged below 60, where such sample selection should be largely absent. We find that the association is indeed smaller in this subsample, but the 95% confidence interval of the effect size overlaps with that of the effect size in the subsample of UKB participants aged 60 and older (Supplementary Table 5.7).\n\nSecond, a well-known missense variant (rs1229984 in ADH1B) that limits alcohol metabolism is positively associated with fat intake. The association is weaker in a sample of UKB alcohol abstainers (N = 39,679; Supplementary Table 5.7), suggesting that it may be partially driven by substitution of fat for alcohol.\n\nThird, one of the protein lead SNPs (rs13146907) is in KLB, which codes an essential cofactor to FGF21, which influences sweet and alcohol taste preference via the liver-brain-endocrine axis. KLB is only associated with protein in our GWAS and MAGMA analyses, while FGF21 is strongly associated with all four macronutrients in both the GWAS and MAGMA analyses. With MAGMA, we also identified MLXIPL (only for fat), a gene that codes a transcription factor to FGF21. This combination of findings suggests that different genes involved in the same pathway are important for directing intake of different macronutrients.\n\nFourth, an intergenic variant (rs2472297) that has been linked to higher caffeine consumption is associated with lower carbohydrate intake. There are various possible explanations, such as interrelated lifestyle choices pertaining to food and caffeinated drinks.\n\nFifth, an intronic variant in GCKR (rs780094), a carbohydrate-metabolism gene, is associated with protein. The lead SNP is in almost perfect LD (r2 = 0.94) with a missense variant that has been associated with lipid levels and type 2 diabetes.\n\nBioinformatic analyses\n\nAnimal studies indicate that the brain and peripheral organs interact in directing macronutrient intake. A question that arises is whether the “periphery”, which digests and metabolizes macronutrients, plays a larger role than the brain, for instance by determining how the brain assigns reward values to macronutrients. (For example, this is partially the case with alcohol, where mutations that affect metabolic capacity render alcohol consumption unpleasant.) While individual loci associated with dietary intake have been studied previously (e.g.,), it is unknown in which tissues the polygenic signal is enriched. To address this question, we used stratified LDSC to identify in which tissues diet-composition-associated SNPs are likely to be expressed (Supplementary Information 6.1). We performed two stratified LDSC analyses, which partitioned SNP heritability according to (i) 10 broadly-defined tissues, which were ascertained with LDSC reference data from chromatin data and (ii) 53 tissues (including 14 brain regions), as ascertained with LDSC reference data from sets of Specifically Expressed Genes in GTEx (known as LDSC-SEG). To correct for multiple testing across tissues, we used Bonferroni-adjusted significance thresholds for the number of tested tissues (α = 0.05/10 = 0.005 and α = 0.05/53 = 9.4 × 10−4, respectively).\n\nWe find that the central nervous system explains the majority of the genetic signal for all macronutrients (for the regression coefficients; Fig. 2), with the proportions of explained heritability ranging from 44% (fat and sugar) to 55% (protein). Within the central nervous system, we find broad involvement of the brain, including (frontal) cortex (fat and sugar), the basal ganglia (fat), limbic system (fat and sugar), cerebellum (protein), and hypothalamus and substantia nigra for fat and protein (and sugar only suggestively after Bonferroni correction). The confidence intervals for the coefficients overlap across brain regions, so we cannot draw conclusions about the specificity of brain regions for intake of particular macronutrients.\n\nFor fat, genetic variation related to adrenals and/or pancreas tissue is estimated to explain 37% of the heritability. Because the adrenals play a role in lipid metabolism, and the pancreas is crucial for digestion, either tissue may plausibly affect fat intake. We caution, however, that in the LDSC-SEG analyses of 53 tissues, all non-brain regions had P-values above 0.05 even before Bonferroni adjustment.\n\nTo gain insight into the putative functions of the top associated loci, we queried the 81 genes identified by the MAGMA analyses in Gene Network, which predicts Reactome functions for genes (Supplementary Information 6.2). In addition to neural functioning (e.g., axon guidance), we find that the MAGMA genes are predicted to be involved in growth factor signaling and the immune system (Supplementary Information 6.6). These results may imply a more pronounced role for peripheral gene functions than our stratified LDSC results, which mainly implicated the brain.\n\nGenetic correlations, heritability estimation, and polygenic prediction\n\nWe estimated pairwise genetic correlations between the macronutrients with bivariate LDSC. All are statistically distinguishable from zero at P < 0.05 (except fat and protein), but also from one and negative one (Supplementary Information 7.1, Supplementary Information 7). (As we explain in Supplementary Information 2.8, negative phenotypic and genetic correlations are not mechanically induced by our phenotype definition.) Thus the macronutrients have overlapping but distinct genetic architectures, consistent with previous work from animal studies showing distinct biological mechanisms involved in macronutrient-specific appetites.\n\nWe calculated GREML estimates of SNP-based heritability using a random N = 30,000 subsample of conventionally unrelated UKB participants. The estimates range from 2.1% for protein to 7.9% for carbohydrate (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 8.1). Our estimates are similar to previous estimates. These heritability estimates might be biased downward due to phenotypic measurement error (Supplementary Information 8.2) and are similar in magnitude to those from other complex (and also noisily measured) behavioral phenotypes, such as subjective wellbeing and risk preferences.\n\nWe constructed polygenic scores for the macronutrient intakes by applying LDpred to our GWAS summary statistics. We assessed the scores’ out-of-sample predictive accuracy in two holdout cohorts: The Health and Retirement Study (N = 2,344) and the Rotterdam Study (N = 3,585). The scores predict the macronutrient intakes with incremental adjusted R2 ranging between 0.08% (P = 0.088) and 0.71% (P = 9.11 × 10−7; Supplementary Table 9.1, Extended Data Fig. 8).\n\nRelationships with health, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status\n\nUsing bivariate LDSC, we estimated genetic correlations between our diet-composition phenotypes and 19 preselected relevant medical and lifestyle phenotypes for which well-powered GWAS results were available. We also included four additional phenotypes for which GWAS results became available after our study was underway, as well as Alzheimer’s disease, motivated by the association we found between APOE and macronutrient intakes, and nine phenotypes from the psychiatric domain. To control for multiple testing, we again used Bonferroni-adjusted P-value thresholds (α = 0.05/33).\n\nProtein exhibits the strongest genetic correlations with poor health outcomes, including obesity (rg = 0.35, SE = 0.04), type 2 diabetes (rg = 0.45, SE = 0.06), fasting insulin (rg = 0.41, SE = 0.08), and coronary artery disease (rg = 0.16, SE = 0.04), as well as BMI (rg = 0.40, SE = 0.04) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 10.2). Fat, sugar, and carbohydrate has negative, non-significant genetic correlations with BMI (rg between −0.06 and −0.02). For comparison, we estimated phenotypic associations between diet composition and BMI in four independent cohorts (combined N = 173,353) and meta-analyzed the results (Fig. 4). Protein (standardized  = 0.090, 95% CI [0.085, 0.094]) and fat (standardized  = 0.069, 95% CI [0.059, 0.067]) are positively associated with BMI, while sugar and carbohydrate are negatively associated with BMI (standardized  = −0.082, 95% CI [−0.087, −0.078]; and −0.084, 95% CI [−0.088, −0.079] respectively, Supplementary Table 11.1). Thus, the genetic correlation between protein and BMI stands out as large relative to the phenotypic correlations. The phenotypic association between overall protein intake and BMI is probably driven by animal protein, which has a positive correlation with BMI (standardized , 95% CI [0.15, 0.18]), while plant protein has a negative correlation between BMI (standardized , 95% CI [−0.08, −0.05]). These protein subtypes were available in four population cohorts with a total N = 15,347. No such large differences are found between natural vs. added sugar and saturated vs. unsaturated fat (Supplementary Table 11.2, Extended Data Fig. 9).\n\nDespite their relatively weak genetic correlations with BMI, sugar, and carbohydrate have negative genetic correlations with waist circumference (rg = −0.13, SE = 0.03, and rg = −0.14, SE = 0.03) and waist-hip ratio (rg = −0.15, SE = 0.04, and rg = −0.18, SE = 0.04) that are larger in magnitude and statistically distinguishable from zero at the 5% level. All the macronutrients have negative genetic correlations with alcohol consumption (rg between −0.61 and −0.11), as expected since alcohol is included in energy intake and our phenotype measures are shares of energy intake (Supplementary Information 2.8).\n\nNext, we computed genetic correlations with indicators of socioeconomic status, which are heritable and known to be phenotypically associated with food access, dietary choices, and health. We found that fat is negatively genetically correlated with educational attainment (rg = −0.13, SE = 0.04). Sugar and carbohydrate are negatively genetically correlated with the Townsend deprivation index (rg = −0.23, SE = 0.06 and −0.30, SE = 0.06), which is constructed from the rates of unemployment, non-ownership of cars and houses, and neighborhood overcrowding, with higher scores indicating more severe socioeconomic deprivation. These genetic correlations might hint at environmental factors involved in macronutrient intake, although these relationships might also be caused by unmeasured, confounding factors.\n\nFinally, we estimate the genetic correlations between diet composition and physical activity, which has widespread physical and mental health benefits. In these genetic correlation analyses, we used unpublished physical activity GWAS summary statistics from a sample of research participants from 23andMe (N = 269,189). The physical activity phenotype is a composite measure based on self-reported activities from leisure, occupation, and commuting. We find a negative genetic correlation of physical activity with fat (rg = −0.32, SE = 0.04) and a positive genetic correlation with sugar (rg = 0.23, SE = 0.04) and carbohydrate (rg = 0.13, SE = 0.04). The genetic correlation with protein is positive but not statistically distinguishable from zero at P < 0.05 (rg = 0.011). In the psychiatric domain, we find negative genetic correlations between saturated fat and schizophrenia (rg = −0.13, SE = 0.04) and between carbohydrate and ADHD (rg = −0.19, SE = 0.04). The negative genetic correlation with schizophrenia contrasts with its known positive phenotypic correlation, as patients with schizophrenia tend to consume higher amounts of saturated fat. The negative genetic correlation with ADHD might be related to ADHD’s responsiveness to dietary intervention, or might be explained by socioeconomic status."

    "content": "Results\n\nGWAS of self-reported walking pace identifies 70 associated loci\n\nWe performed a GWAS of self-reported walking pace in 450,967 individuals of European ancestry from UK Biobank (full details in Methods). The phenotype was coded 0, 1 and 2 for self-reported slow, steady/average and brisk walking pace, and the characteristics of participants across these categories are summarised in Supplementary Data 1. We used a linear mixed model with covariates for age, sex, genotyping array and 20 principal components of ancestry implemented in BOLT-LMM v2.3.3. After quality control 10,061,374 imputed variants were analysed (Fig. 1). We identified 144 independent significant SNPs across 70 genomic loci (Table 1), indexed by 75 lead SNPs (Supplementary Data 2).\n\nWe estimated an inflation in the test statistics (λGC = 1.597, mean χ2 = 1.767) but, similarly to other phenotypes analysed in UK Biobank, the LD score intercept of 1.058 (s.e. = 0.0120) suggests that the inflation is largely due to polygenic signal and the large sample size rather than population substructure.\n\nAs there is a clear negative association between BMI and self-reported walking pace (Supplementary Data 1), we were concerned that the results may simply reflect genetic associations with BMI, which have been extensively described. We therefore performed a sensitivity analysis by including BMI as a covariate in the model (Fig. 1). Of the 70 associated loci only 15 retained genome-wide significance following adjustment for BMI, whilst 45 loci in total maintained a suggestive significance level (P < 10−5). In addition, using LD score regression we observed a strong genetic correlation between self-reported walking pace with and without adjustment for BMI (rg = 0.83, s.e. = 0.0073), suggesting that much of the genetic component of walking pace is independent of BMI.\n\nPost-GWAS annotation, gene-based analysis and tissue-enrichment analyses\n\nA detailed annotation catalogue of candidate SNPs in the associated genomic loci is presented in Supplementary Data 3. Of the 70 independently associated genomic loci, 59 have previously reported suggestive associations for other traits and diseases (Supplementary Data 4). The strongest overlaps with the self-reported walking pace include 28 shared loci with BMI, 20 loci associated with educational attainment and 13 loci associated with hand grip strength.\n\nUsing positional mapping and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, we identified a total of 535 genes associated with genome-wide significant SNPs (Supplementary Data 5). We also performed a genome-wide gene-based association study (GWGAS) that identified 255 genes associated with self-reported walking pace (Supplementary Data 6), of which 152 were implicated through positional or eQTL mapping.\n\nThe strongest self-reported walking pace signals were identified within SLC39A8 on chromosome 4, which has previously been associated with metabolic traits, FTO on chromosome 16, strongly associated with fat mass and obesity, and TCF4 on chromosome 18, linked to neurocognitive traits and psychiatric disease. Of these, SLC39A8 and TCF4 remained genome-wide significant after adjustment for BMI, while the association of FTO was attenuated as expected but remained nominally associated (Supplementary Data 2).\n\nTo prevent against the potential pleiotropic effects of adiposity-related SNPs in the gene analysis, we further assessed genes that remained prioritised following adjustment for BMI. Of the 152 genes implicated by both the gene mapping and gene-based analyses, 78 remained significantly associated with self-reported walking pace following BMI adjustment. These genes included GDF5, ACBD4, H1FX, PTPN9, FAM83C and UQCC1 which have previously been associated with height; MMP24, NCOA6, PIGU, GSS and PLCD3, associated with lean body mass; MAPT, TRPC4AP, DCAKD, GGT7 and PROCR, associated with heel bone mineral density, and several genes linked to educational attainment and cognitive function (SDCCAG8, BTN3A2, TCF4, HIST1H4H, ABT1, TXNL1, NYAP2 and ZNF322).\n\nWe assessed whether tissue types from the GTEx database were enriched for differences in self-reported walking pace. Genes that were associated with self-reported walking pace had increased expression in the brain (P = 9.6 × 10−4) and pituitary (P = 3.1 × 10−6), with tissue-specific enrichments found in the cerebellar hemisphere (P = 5.4 × 10−7) and cerebellum (P = 2.1 × 10−6) (Supplementary Data 7).\n\nInterpretable SNP-heritability estimates\n\nTo provide an interpretable heritability estimate for an ordinal outcome, we parameterised self-reported walking pace on the liability scale. Self-reported walking pace on the observed scale y takes the values 0, 1 and 2 with frequencies πj for the three ordered categories. The underlying latent variable l ~ N(0, 1) is related to the observed scale through thresholds t1 and t2 in the equation\n\nThe heritabilities on the observed and liability scales are related using the result\n\nderived by Gianola, where zj is the standard normal density at threshold tj and Vo = ∑3k=1 k2 πk −(∑3k=1 kπk)2 (see Supplementary Note 1).\n\nWe used BOLT-REML adjusting for age, sex, genotyping array and 20 principal components to first estimate the SNP-heritability on the observed scale. Then, using Eq. (1) to convert between scales, we estimated the SNP-heritability for self-reported walking pace on the liability scale as 13.2% (s.e. = 0.21%). With BMI included as a covariate, the heritability is reduced to 8.9% (s.e. = 0.17%).\n\nGenetic overlap with other traits and diseases\n\nWe assessed whether self-reported walking pace has a shared genetic basis with other complex traits, which may reflect common biological mechanisms or causal effects in either direction. We examined genetic correlations rg between self-reported walking pace and a range of 53 traits using LD score regression. The traits were assorted into categories including anthropometric traits, cardiometabolic traits, cognition and educational attainment, and aging-related traits. We observed significant genetic correlations with 39 traits based on a Bonferroni corrected threshold (P < 9.4 × 10−4), with results summarised in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 8.\n\nThe genetic architecture of self-reported walking pace overlaps highly with traits relating to adiposity (BMI, rg = −0.52, P = 4.7 × 10−179), education and cognition (years of schooling, rg = 0.51, P = 3.4 × 10−170; intelligence rg = 0.34, P = 3.1 × 10−72) and longevity (parentsʼ age at death, rg = 0.54, P = 3.9 × 10−12). Overall, traits related to cardiometabolic risk, lung function, psychiatric disease and muscular strength show genetic correlations with self-reported walking pace. The genetic correlations also support many of the phenotypic associations that have been observed across categories of walking pace in external cohorts. Traits that remained genetically correlated with self-reported walking pace after adjusting for BMI included hand grip strength, measures of lung function such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), years of schooling, intelligence, insomnia and depressive symptoms. Genetic correlations with adiposity-related traits and glycemic traits were attenuated following adjustment for BMI.\n\nPolygenic risk score association with all-cause mortality\n\nWe explored whether the strong associations that exist between self-reported walking pace and survival can be explained partly through genetic predisposition. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the association of genetically predicted walking pace, estimated through polygenic risk scores (PRS) with a range of P-value thresholds, and all-cause mortality. We conducted our analyses using sex-stratified GWAS results for self-reported walking pace (see “Methods”) to control for sample overlap.\n\nWe observed a significant association between genetic variants associated with self-reported walking pace and all-cause mortality in males (PRS with P < 10−2; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92–0.97; P = 1.93 × 10−5) and females (PRS with P < 10−2; HR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.92–0.98; P = 2.70 × 10−3) (Table 2). We performed further analyses to examine the possibility of BMI acting as a mediator of the associations. When we adjusted for BMI in the model, the association with all-cause mortality remained significant both in males (PRS with P < 10−2; HR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93–0.98; P = 4.40 × 10−4) and females (PRS with P < 10−2; HR = 0.95; 95%CI 0.92–0.98; P = 2.24 × 10−3), which suggests the effect of the genetic variants on mortality is partly independent of BMI.\n\nMendelian randomisation\n\nWe performed MR to test for credible causal associations between walking pace and genetically correlated traits. We tested 21 traits for causal relationships with self-reported walking pace at a Bonferroni significance threshold of P < 2.3 × 10−3, using only GWAS data from large scale, published studies of European ancestry that do not include participants from the UK Biobank cohort. The 75 lead SNPs for self-reported walking pace were used as genetic instruments within a two-sample MR, with walking pace as the exposure.\n\nGenetically predicted self-reported walking pace was associated with a range of cardiometabolic, respiratory, psychiatric and sleeping traits (Supplementary Data 9). An increase in genetically predicted walking pace is associated with lower BMI (βIVW = −1.37, PIVW = 6.7 × 10−12), lower risk of coronary artery disease (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34, PIVW = 3.1 × 10−8), higher HDL cholesterol levels (βIVW = 0.95, PIVW = 3.3 × 10−9) and higher FEV1 (βIVW = 0.35, PIVW = 2.9 × 10−5). We found no evidence of directional pleiotropy by testing the intercept of MR-Egger analysis (Supplementary Data 9).\n\nTo examine the potential pleiotropic effects of adiposity-related SNPs on the MR results, we conducted two sensitivity analyses accounting for the effects of BMI.\n\nFirstly, largely similar results were found when we excluded 28 SNPs that were previously associated with BMI (Supplementary Data 10). Similar magnitude associations remained between increased genetically predicted walking pace and lower risk of coronary artery disease (OR = 0.37, PIVW = 1.5 × 10−5) and higher FEV1 (βIVW = 0.33, PIVW = 1.6 × 10−3), though a weaker effect was observed on lowering BMI (βIVW = −0.55, PIVW = 2.1 × 10−6). Associations were substantially weakened following the exclusion of adiposity-related SNPs between genetically predicted walking pace and glycemic traits such as fasting insulin, HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index) and type 2 diabetes, suggesting a contribution of pleiotropy that confounds the MR results in these cases.\n\nSecondly, we included both self-reported walking pace and BMI in a multivariable MR (Supplementary Data 11). After the inclusion of BMI as an exposure, only the association between genetically predicted walking pace and waist-to-hip ratio remained significant. This may suggest that the observed associations found between genetically predicted walking pace on lower cardiovascular risk and improved lung function are pleiotropically mediated through BMI. Alternatively, because the multivariable MR tests the direct causal effect of walking pace while holding BMI constant, the analysis may have limited power to detect such an effect when the causal effect of walking pace is substantially mediated through BMI."

    "content": "Results\n\nDescriptive statistics of the 12 anthropometric measures from both polities are presented in Table 1. As previously stated, all measures were adjusted for the effects of age and gender due to their correlation with body fat. The American Samoans had significantly higher fat-related measures, were taller, and significantly larger skeletal measurements except elbow breadth in comparison to the Samoans.\n\nTwo genotyped SNPs and seven imputed SNPs were excluded from the analysis due to low MAF (<.05) and deviations from HWE (P <.01). The pairwise LD plot of the remaining 51 SNPs was identical for American Samoa and Samoa (data not shown). There were no significant differences in allele frequencies between American Samoa and Samoa; compiled SNP statistics with comparative minor allele frequencies from Asian (CHB) and Caucasian (CEU) HapMaps are presented in Table 2. In general, Samoan allele frequencies were relatively closer to those of the Asian population than those of the Caucasian population. Of note, MAFs of the previously reported eight GWAS SNPs were significantly lower in both Samoan groups (0.161–0.239) than the CEU (0.292–0.478).\n\nWe tested associations of 51 SNPs with the anthropometric traits adjusted for age and gender. The analysis was performed separately for American Samoan and Samoan samples due to significant differences in phenotypic traits between the two polities (see Table 1). Thirty-six out of 1,224 P-values were nominally significant, though none were previous GWAS SNPs (Table 3; all data with the nominal P-values are presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Thirty-two of the thirty six nominal associations were observed in Samoan sample. Of these, 26 were associated with measures of skeletal robustness (height and knee, wrist, and elbow breadth). No significant association, however, was found with any SNP after correction for multiple testing. A combined analysis and gender-specific analysis of the FTO SNPs in the American Samoa and Samoa did not uncover any further associations (data not shown). Finally, a meta analysis was performed to uncover any consistent signals of association observed in both polities, but the results did not change (Supplementary Table 3). A second meta analysis was performed to combine the association signals of rs9939609 in both Samoan polities and the Tongan population reported by, but the signal remained insignificant (P=0.424).\n\nSince the majority of previous FTO reports have included BMI as the principal phenotype, we have estimated the effect sizes of nominally significant SNPs on BMI in the American Samoa and Samoan samples. There was no commonly associated SNP with BMI between the two polities; the effect size estimates for the two SNPs in Samoa (rs1861869, β =−0.347; rs7186521, β=−0.586) were lower than the SNP effect size estimate in American Samoa (rs1164281, β=−0.931). The confidence intervals of these estimates (Table 3) overlapped with reported point estimates in previous GWAS."

    "content": "Results\n\nCorrelation structure and cluster of anthropometric measures\n\nSummary statistics of the 11 anthropometrics and two derivatives (BMI and WHR) are listed in Table 1 for males (N = 360) and females (N = 483) separately. Since these measures are correlated with gender and age (data not shown), we first adjusted the effects of gender and age and their interaction term by linear regression. Unless otherwise mentioned, all data analyses were performed on these adjusted measures.\n\nThe anthropometric measures we studied correlated to each other (Supplement Table S1). Therefore, we first clustered these phenotype measures based on their pairwise correlation structure using hierarchical cluster approach. As expected, the measures that reflect “body fatness” (Wt, HC, WC and BMI) together with UAC clustered together (cluster 1). Likewise, a second cluster (cluster 2) reflecting “subcutaneous obesity” was represented by the five skin fold measures. Ht, WHR and UAW were outliers to these two clusters (Figure 2).\n\nGenetic association analysis\n\nAmong the 36 genotyped SNPs, seven were excluded from the analysis either due to low minor allele frequency (5 with MAF<0.05) or deviation from HWE (2 with exact HWE test P-value<0.01). We tested the genetic association of the remaining 29 SNPs with each of the adjusted anthropometric trait using the single-locus score test under additive model (1df test). The distribution and the pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) of these 29 SNPs are shown in Figure 3. Significant associations were found between several SNPs and various phenotypic measures (Table 2). Majority of these significant associations were between the “body fatness” measures (Wt, HC, WC and BMI) of cluster 1 and a set of highly polymorphic SNP markers (MAF>0.3) that are located between rs7206790 (No. 9) and rs1861867 (No. 27), which spans approximately 50kb. For abbreviation, we refer to these 15 significant markers as “body fatness” markers (highlighted in boldface in Table 2). These associations remained significant even after multiple-testing adjustment on the number of markers by permutation test (Table 2 and Supplement Table S2).\n\nInterestingly, UAW was found to be significantly associated with “body fatness” markers, although it is less closely correlated with the “body fatness” traits (Figure 2). In addition, one significant association signal was found between UAW and rs16952517 (No. 6, P-value = 0.00156, significant even with permutation test). In contrast, “body fatness” markers were less significantly associated with UAC (a member of cluster 1 traits) compared with UAW. WHR and two skin fold measures (TrS and SbS) of cluster 2 also showed nominally significant associations with some of these markers, significance of which were not supported by the permutation test.\n\nSince multiple cluster 1 measures and UAW were found to be associated with similar sets of SNP markers, we performed a principle component analysis (PCA) to evaluate whether some “lower-dimensional summary” of these variables provide more information about the observed associations. We identified three major components (PC1, PC2 and PC3) that could explain up to 90% of the total variance of these measures (Supplement Table S3).\n\nThe first component (PC1) explained more than 70% of the total variance and was approximately an average of all the included measures with similar loading coefficients (around −0.40∼−0.45), except for UAW (with a loading coefficient of −0.264). The association signals (P-values) observed between PC1 and the “body fatness” markers shared similar pattern with individual body fatness measures (Wt, HC, WC and BMI) and the highest association peak was found at rs1421085 (P-value = 0.000307) (Figure 4A). Therefore, we considered PC1 as a summary variable for “body fatness” and it well captured the significant association between individual “body fatness” measures and “body fatness” markers. To confirm this, we tested association using PC1 as covariate to remove the effect of “body fatness”. As expected, all the significant signals found between “body fatness” measures and “body fatness” markers disappeared (P-value>0.01) after the adjustment for PC1 (Supplement Figure S1). We also performed association test conditional on rs1421085 (the most significant marker) to investigate whether the significant association signals between “body fatness” measures and “body fatness” markers can be explained by a single locus. Again, after adjustment for rs1421085, the significant signals on other “body fatness” markers diminished (Supplement Figure S2).\n\nThe second component (PC2) had a prominent UAW constituent (with a loading coefficient of 0.935) and it mainly represented the effect of UAW with adjustments of other variables. Not surprisingly, PC2 was not associated with “body fatness” markers because PC2 was independent to PC1 and the later already absorbed most of the variance of “body fatness”. In this sense, PC2 could be approximately regarded as UAW adjusted for PC1 or “body fatness” (UAW|PC1 in Figure 4B), which was exemplified by the similar association pattern of these two variables. Interestingly, unlike the “body fatness” markers, the unique significant association between rs16952517 and UAW still hold for PC2 (P-value = 0.00531) and PC1 adjusted-UAW (P-value = 0.00372).\n\nSimilar to PC2, the third component (PC3) mainly represents the effect of UAC (with a loading coefficient of −0.878) and could be approximately regarded as UAC adjusted for PC1 (or “body fatness”) represented as UAC|PC1 in Figure 4C. Accordingly, PC3 was not associated with the “body fatness” markers. However, two novel significant association signals emerged between PC3 and rs11075986 (P-value = 0.00255) and rs16945088 (P-value = 0.00142). Similar association signals exist between PC1 adjusted UAC (UAC|PC1) and rs11075986 (P-value = 0.00211) and rs16945088 (P-value = 0.00203)."

    "content": "Results\n\nBaseline characteristics of the subjects in each cohort are presented in Table 1. A total of 2,954 SNPs (77.2%–91.1% imputed SNPs) covering the six targeted genes were meta-analyzed. A total of 45 SNPs located in the FTO gene demonstrated significant associations with obesity phenotypes using a Bonfferoni corrected significance level of P<1.68×10−5. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed that these 45 SNPs were in almost complete LD (r2>0.80) and were located within the same LD block of approximately 50 kb (Figure 1). Another 125 SNPs out of the 1,275 total SNPs spanning the FTO gene in the present study showed marginal associations with obesity phenotypes (meta-analysis P-values ranging from 1.71×10−5 to 4.99×10−2) (Results not shown).\n\n Table 2 shows the top 15 FTO SNPs associated with obesity traits. For most variants, little heterogeneity among cohorts was observed, except for rs9922708 for which moderate heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 43% and QP-value = 0.091). The direction of effects was consistent across studies except for three SNPs (rs9922708, rs17817449 and rs7206790). The trans-ethnic meta-analysis using MANTRA closely mirrored the results from the standard meta-analysis using METAL. The most significant association was observed for FTO rs7185735 (P-value = 1.01×10−7 for BMI, 1.80×10−6 for FM, and 5.29×10−4 for PBF) (Table 2), and allele-specific OR (95% CI) reached 1.20 (1.12–1.28) for BMI, 1.18(1.10–1.28) for FM and 1.13 (1.05–1.21) for PBF (Figure 2). The frequency of minor allele G at this imputed SNP ranged from 0.11 (Chinese) to 0.47 (Caucasian) in different ethnic groups. The forest plot for this SNP indicated that its strongest association was observed in QFS (OR = 1.51 for BMI, 1.49 for FM and 1.37 for PBF). Carriers of the G allele had higher BMI, FM and PBF values (Figure 2).\n\nFor the other five genes, 26 SNPs, 11 SNPs and 33 SNPs from CTNNBL1, PPARG and LEPR showed marginal significance of associations with P-values ranging between 1.50×10−3 and 4.94×10−2(Results not shown). The strongest associations for the CTNNBL1, PPARG and LEPR gene markers were: CTNNBL1 rs45500793 (P-value = 2.68×10−3 for BMI, 6.34×10−3 for FM, and 2.06×10−2 for PBF), LEPR rs9436744 (P-value = 3.16×10−3 for BMI, 2.33×10−2 for FM, and 7.55×10−2 for PBF) and PPARG rs10222537 (P-value = 1.50×10−3 for BMI, 1.19×10−2 for FM, and 6.77×10−2 for PBF). We did not detect association between any variants in the ADRB2 and UCP2 genes and obesity phenotypes.\n\nTo identify potential sex-specific loci, we performed a series of meta-analyses stratified by sex. In female specific samples, 25 FTO SNPs were significantly associated with BMI and FM, all of which overlapped with the findings obtained with the combined sample. There was no evidence of significant associations in the male specific samples (Table 3). However, a nominally significant association was revealed at rs16952725 of FTO in males (P-value = 6.87×10−4 for BMI and P-value = 8.55×10−3 for FM), but not in the female specific sample (P-value = 0.55 for BMI and P-value = 0.43 for FM) (Table 3). We estimated the statistical power at various locus heritabilities for the total sample, males and females (Figure 3). Our total sample and female sample have >90% power to detect a variant explaining >0.40% of heritability. However, the male sample only have 30% power to detect a variant explaining >0.40% of heritability.\n\nFinally, we examined potential differences of SNP association with obesity phenotypes among the four ethnic groups (Chinese, Caucasians, African Americans and Hispanic-Americans). In Caucasians, we found that 35 FTO SNPs were significantly associated with BMI and FM (P<1.68×10−5); 28 of these 35 SNPs overlapped with those derived from the analysis performed on the combined samples. The most significant association was observed for rs17817288 in FTO (P-value = 1.96×10−7 for BMI, 2.76×10−5 for FM, and 2.39×10−3 for PBF). However, these significant FTO SNPs in Caucasians showed no or weak evidence of association in non-Caucasian populations (Table 4, Figure 1). Therefore, the association results of FTO obtained with the combined samples were mostly contributed by the Caucasian group. For example, P-value was 1.01×10−7 for the most significant SNP rs7185735 in the combined samples for BMI, 4.90×10−7 in Caucasians, 7.47×10−2 in Chinese, 6.05×10−1 in African-Americans and 4.45×10−1 in Hispanic-Americans. In non-Caucasian populations, we only found marginally significant associations. Two FTO SNPs (rs7201444 and rs13335146) specific in Hispanic-Americans, 14 FTO SNPs and one LEPR SNP(rs9436299) specific in African Americans and one CTNNBL1 SNP (rs45500793) specific in Chinese showed marginally significant associations (P-value<1×10−3) (Table 4, Figure 1). Table 4 listed 2 SNPs specific in Hispanic-Americans, 15 SNPs specific in African Americans, 1 SNP specific in Chinese and top 15 SNPs specific in Caucasians. To assess genetic differences for these ethnic-specific SNPs (listed in Table 4) among the eight populations, FST were calculated. Nine FTO variants (rs1861869, rs7186521, rs17817288, rs8044769, rs11075987, rs9935401, rs8051591, rs7193144, rs8043757) and CTNNBL1 SNP (rs45500793) showed little population differentiation (FST = 0–0.05). FST of other SNPs ranged from 0.05 to 0.31, suggesting moderate/great genetic differentiation. FTO rs7201444 showed very great differentiation with the frequency of minor allele A ranging from 0.001 (Chinese) to 0.365 (African-Americans).\n\nIn addition, we examined the association of previously reported SNPs of the six genes among our dataset (Table 5). All of the 10 previously reported FTO SNPs (rs1421085, rs1558902, rs17817449, rs9941349, rs8050136, rs1558902, rs1121980, rs7202116, rs9939609 and rs9930506) showed significant/nominal associations with BMI, FM and/or PBF. Two PPARG SNPs (rs1801282 and rs3856806) and 3 CTNNBL1 variants (rs6013029, rs16986921 and rs6020712) showed nominal associations with obesity traits."

    "content": "Results\n\nWe analyzed genotype data for 520 cases and 540 control subjects, and performed a GWAS on obesity as a binary trait. We observed a strong association of obesity to the FTO gene, with the most significantly associated marker being rs3751812 (P = 2.01×10−8, odds ratio = 1.64). All association signals with P<10−5 are shown in  Table 3 , and the Manhattan plot is shown in  Figure 1 . No additional loci with genome-wide significance were identified in the GWAS; nevertheless, the fact that FTO readily reached genome-wide significance in a small data set confirmed the high quality of the phenotypes within the sample collection. It also illustrated how a small sample ascertained from extreme phenotypes have high power to detect genuinely associated genes, compared to quantitative trait association analysis conducted on population-based samples.\n\nConsidering the possibility that some obesity-associated genes may be enriched among the top ranked genes in GWAS, we next followed up selected association signals (∼500 top SNPs) by iSelect genotyping on 2,256 cases, family members and controls. Additionally, we also performed dense genotyping of 49 SNPs in the FTO gene itself, including 7 from the original top 500 and 42 spanning the entire gene. We used the MQLS software for the association analysis, to account for the familial relationships. Interestingly, the significance for FTO SNPs increased by several orders of magnitude (P-values range from 10−9 to 10−12), suggesting that genotyping additional family members increased power to detect genuine associations ( Table 4 ).\n\nWe next completed exploratory analyses of quantitative measures of obesity. In part because of the extreme bimodality of the phenotype distributions based on sample ascertainment, we controlled for case/control status. Moreover, this approach makes it possible to assess the potential effects of genes on the extent of obesity in extremely obese individuals. The complete set of results (P<1×10−6) were given in  Table 5 . We note that a few markers reached P<5×10−8, notably waist circumference (chromosome 21, rs11088859, p = 3.75×10−8, nearest gene NCAM2), and waist to hip ratio (chromosome 14, rs11624704, p = 2.67×10−9, nearest gene NRXN3), but the NCAM2 locus cannot be regarded as genome-wide significant considering the need to adjust for multiple phenotypes being tested. Therefore, these exploratory results were provided as potentially interesting findings worthy of additional replication efforts.\n\n Table S1 summarizes our results with respect to previously reported associations with obesity related traits. As noted, only FTO and NRXN3 reached genome wide significance. Three genes, including SH2B1, MC4R and KCTD15, showed trends towards significance in the case/control association tests (P-value ranges from 0.015 to 0.065), but they did not pass multiple testing thresholds (based on number of genes tested). For quantitative traits, we cannot estimate the power of our study, since previously published studies utilized population samples for quantitative trait association with BMI. Nevertheless, in our data, it is interesting to see that MC4R and FTO are the two genes with the strongest effect sizes (risk allele odds ratio >1.2), probably explaining why they were the first two genes identified in GWAS for BMI."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nTable 1 shows the descriptive statistics for the study risk factors. Smoking was relatively common with 28% of the women smoking about 6 cigarettes per day on average. About one in four smokers at pregnancy quit smoking during the pregnancy. Nearly 60% of women reported drinking sometime during pregnancy, and binge drinking was observed in about one in four women in the first trimester but declined substantially during the second and third trimesters. Thirty-two percent of women who drank alcohol before pregnancy abstained from using alcohol during the pregnancy. About 8% of the women were obese, and average BMI was 23.5 in the total sample. On average, women gained 14.6 kilograms throughout pregnancy. Excessive weight gain (according to IOM guidelines) was observed in about one-third (32.5%) of women, and 43.6% gained an inadequate amount of weight.\n\nTables 2, 3, and 4 report summaries of the SNP associations with the smoking, alcohol, and weight measures, respectively; detailed results for each SNP and risk factor are in Supplementary Table A1 online. There were several SNPs and genes related to the risk factors at p<0.05. Of these, 23 SNPs and 9 genes were significantly related to the risk factors after the gene-based correction for multiple testing. However, only 4 of these loci were significant under the SNP-based correction threshold. We summarize the results below for each risk factor category.\n\nSmoking\n\nOf the 733 SNPs in 79 candidate genes for smoking, 50 SNPs in 19 genes/loci were found to be associated with any smoking during pregnancy at p<0.05 (Table 2). However, none remained significantly associated with any smoking after SNP-based (p<6.8E-05) or gene/locus-based (p<0.0006) corrections for multiple testing. Similarly, none of the loci were significantly related to smoking status by trimester at the SNP-level corrected threshold; however, ACTN1(rs4902682), DBH (rs2519155), and rs3791729 (CHRND) were significantly associated with any smoking in the first, second, and third trimester respectively after gene/locus-level correction for multiple testing.\n\nSeveral SNPs were associated with the various measures of number of cigarettes at p<0.05; however, none of the genes/loci remained significant at the SNP-level corrected threshold (Table 2). The number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy among smokers was associated with 27 SNPs in 18 genes/loci at p<0.05 (Table 2). Of these, none were significant after adjustment for multiple testing (same thresholds as for any smoking). ACTN1 (rs181484 and rs4902682) was significant at the gene/locus-level corrected threshold for the average number of cigarettes smoked in the total sample (with 0 for non-smokers), and the number of cigarettes smoked in the first (rs4902682, rs2268968, and rs181484) and third trimesters (rs4902682). CHRNA3 (rs12914385) was significant at gene/locus-level threshold for the number of cigarettes among smokers in the first trimester.\n\nFinally, 35 SNPs in 19 genes/loci were associated with quitting smoking among those who were smokers at the beginning of pregnancy, but none of these were significant at the SNP-level threshold. Only two SNPs in FAAH (rs3766246) and DBH (rs2519147) were significant at the gene/locus-level threshold.\n\nAlcohol use\n\nOf the 493 evaluated SNPs in 29 candidate genes/loci for maternal alcohol consumption, none were significantly related to any of the alcohol consumption measures at the SNP-level threshold (Table 3). 12 SNPs in 7 genes/loci were significantly related to any alcohol use during pregnancy at p<0.05. Of these, one SNP (rs6035239) in PDYN remained significant after gene/locus-based correction for multiple testing but was insignificant after SNP-based correction (p<1.0E-04).\n\nADH1C (rs11499823) was significant at the gene/locus-level threshold for any drinking in the first trimester. Several SNPs in/near GRM8 were significantly related to any drinking in second trimester, any binging during pregnancy, and any first-trimester binging at the gene-level threshold.\n\nFinally, 15 SNPs in 9 genes/loci were significantly related to quitting alcohol during pregnancy at p<0.05; however, none of these SNPs were significant at SNP- or gene/locus-level corrected thresholds.\n\nBody weight\n\nOf the 285 SNPs in 15 genes/loci evaluated for maternal pre-pregnancy body weight, 22 variants in 5 genes/loci were related to maternal obesity at p<0.05 (Table 4). Of these, 7 SNPs (rs9941349, rs3751812, rs8050136, rs10852521, rs7190492, rs8044769, and rs9930333) in FTO remained significant after gene/locus-level correction for multiple testing (p<0.0033). Four of these (rs9930333, rs9941349, rs3751812, and rs8050136) remained significant after SNP-based correction for multiple testing (p<1.75E-04).\n\nFourteen SNPs in 3 genes/loci were associated with BMI at p<0.05 (Table 2). Of these, 6 SNPs (rs8050136, rs3751812, rs9941349, rs7190492, rs8044769, and rs9930333) in FTO were significant after gene/locus-based correction for multiple testing (same threshold as for obesity). Two SNPs (rs8050136 and rs3751812) were significant after SNP-based correction (Table 4).\n\nFinally, 15 SNPs in 5 genes/loci were related to weight gain during pregnancy measured continuously at p<0.05, but none of them remained significant after SNP- or gene/locus-level corrected thresholds. However, one SNP (rs2293084) in TMEM18 and another (rs2540766) in FTO were significantly related to excessive and inadequate weight gain, respectively, after gene/locus-correction."

In the replication stage, 29 of the FTO SNPs and 1 of the MC4R SNPs were statistically significantly associated with BMI (Supplementary Table 2). None of the initially-identified SNPs from the discovery stage were associated with colorectal cancer risk with adjustment for age, sex, and PCAs; after additionally adjusting for BMI, two FTO SNPs (rs8046502 and rs4784329) had p-values < 0.05; the ORs were 1.04 (95% CI: 1.00 - 1.09; p = 0.048) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.92 - 1.00; p = 0.048) for these two SNPs, respectively (Table 1).

    "content": "Results\n\nSequencing and mapping\n\nIn this study, we sequenced 95% of the entire human FTO gene and surrounding sequence, a region spanning 411 606 bases. The DNA was collected from a pool of 524 severely obese children and a pool of 527 lean controls (Figure 1). In total, we successfully sequenced 389 501 bases; the non-sequenced regions were excluded owing to difficulties in the PCR enrichment, which was primarily due to genomic repeats. After mapping, a high sequencing depth was obtained across the FTO region, with a median read depth of 17 385 and 18 385 in the obese and control pools, respectively. This corresponds to an ∼16-fold read depth per allele in each pool for 50% of the positions (Figure 3). Furthermore, ∼95% of all positions had at least 1000 in read depth in both pools, which corresponds to an average ∼1-fold read depth for each FTO allele in the pools (∼1000  alleles/pool) for most sites. The coverage correlates well for each position between the two pools (r=0.92), and the same pattern of coverage peaks were reproduced in each independently sequenced pool (Figure 4). Characteristic peaks were found close to the primers of each amplicon, with peaks reaching a maximum of more than 345 000 fold coverage. Therefore, both primer regions, and the overlap between PCR amplicons, were excluded from further analysis. These regions add up to 40 944 bases, which leaves 348 557 bases for inclusion in the variant calling and analysis.\n\nSNP calling and estimation of allele frequencies\n\nCandidate SNPs were identified in reads containing valid adjacent mismatches, as defined by the SOLiD system, and allele frequencies were estimated by counting the number of reads containing the reference allele and the number of reads containing the putative SNP. To remove potential false-positive SNPs, primarily from amplification errors during the PCR enrichment, we used a statistical approach to determine a threshold for the minimum number of UVAM required for a SNP candidate to be considered reliable (Figure 2). The UVAM thresholds were 21 for the obese pool and 23 for the control pool. This difference was caused by the higher coverage obtained in the control pool. In addition, SNPs were only called if they were detected in both pools, if the number of reads were distributed equally between the DNA strands (at least 23% for the strand with the lowest coverage) and if they were located outside of amplicon overlaps. Based on these conditions, 705 SNPs with a minor allele frequency above 1% were called, and out of these we found 19 SNPs that were not present in dbSNP(v132) and, hence, considered novel (Supplementary Information 2). In comparison, 5091 SNPs were detected when not applying the above filtration steps.\n\nTo test the validity of the UVAM filtration, we selected 48 high-frequency SNPs without first applying the UVAM threshold that had a strong obesity association for genotyping with custom-designed array. Out of the SNPs selected for genotyping, 25 were found in dbSNP, whereas the remainders were candidate novel polymorphisms. The genotyping failed for two SNPs (rs11076004 and rs3751814) and these were removed from further analysis. However, the genotyping clearly showed that all of the candidate SNPs not found in dbSNP were monoallelic, and thereby erroneously called SNPs (Supplementary Information 3). In contrast, when applying the UVAM filtration, all these false candidate SNPs were removed, which strongly validates the applied method. Among the genotyped variations found in dbSNP, four (rs11076004, rs28665159, rs34270264 and rs9928425) were found to be monoallelic. However, our filtration removed all these SNPs. Of the 17 true genotyped SNPs, four (rs1558902, rs12933996, rs9939609 and rs8063057) were removed as they were found in amplicon overlap regions or did not achieve good enough strand distribution.\n\nThe 13 genotyped true SNP correlations, between estimated allele frequencies from the SOLiD sequencing and the array had a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.76 (P<2.26 × 10−3) in the obese pool and 0.89 (P<3.25 × 10−5) in the control pool. Furthermore, the absolute error of the SOLiD sequencing was 5% and 8% (relative error 0.10 and 0.17) in the obese and control pool, respectively.\n\nIndel calling and allele frequency estimation\n\nSmall insertions and deletions (indels) were called with two methods: SplitSeek, which realigns unmapped reads from corona lite; and gapped alignments using bwa and samtools. Indels were only considered valid if they were called by both approaches and frequencies, were estimated from the coverage of the alternate and reference sequence allele that were achieved by bwa. With this approach, 13 insertions and 27 deletions were called, ranging from 1 to 9 residues in length (Supplementary Information 4). Sixteen of these overlap known indels in dbSNP, whereas the remaining twenty-four are considered potential novel variants. The frequency differences between the pools were very small, with an average absolute deviation of 0.6% and a Pearson's correlation coefficient equal to 0.999.\n\nThe obesity-associated variation pattern\n\nFisher's exact test was performed, based on the allele frequencies for each SNP and indel with an estimated minor allele frequency above 5%, to test for association with the obese versus the lean group (Supplementary Information 2). First, 22 SNPs from the SOLiD data were considered associated with obesity (P<1.14 × 10−3) and were found in three different regions of the gene: 20 SNPs were found within the well-known obesity-associated haplotype block of intron one; 2 in intron eight and 1 in intron nine. However, after validation by genotyping with a TaqMan assay, one SNP in intron one and one in intron nine were found to be monoalleic and were excluded (Supplementary Information 3). In addition, the two SNPs in intron eight were far from association with obesity when the calculation was based on the genotyping. All of the 19 candidate obesity-associated SNPs were found within a 31 794-bp-long region (hg18 chr16:52 357 478-52 389 272) that lies within the known obesity-associated haplotype block of intron one. Ten of the 19 putative obesity-associated SNPs from the SOLiD data in intron one were genotyped with the 48-plex GoldenGate array and analyzed for association with obesity using logarithmic regression and controlling for sex (See Table 1 for a summary of the association tests for all true SNPs associated with obesity calculated on the SOLiD data). Based on the genotyping, all 10 SNPs were associated with obesity, when not adjusting for multiple testing. However, when adjusting for the 44 haplotype blocks in the FTO region, 3 SNPs (rs55872725, rs11642015 and rs62048402) were associated (P<1.1 × 10−3). The SNPs, rs11642015 and rs62048402, were the top-associated SNPs, when calculating association tests based on SOLiD estimates and genotyping. No indel was considered associated with obesity, even when not adjusting for multiple testing (P>0.05). For results from the validation in Greek and Lativan populations, see Supplementary Information 1 and 5.\n\nBy using the UCSC browser, the genetic data were integrated with ENCODE data of gene regulation and DNA sequence conservation between vertebrate species, to try to identify candidate functional variants among the obesity-associated SNPs (Figure 5 and Supplementary Information 1)."

    "content": "Results\n\nTable 1 is the basic characteristics of the subjects used in discovery sample and replication sample 1. The basic characteristics of replication sample 2 are summarized in the previous research. Genomic control inflation factor of discovery sample is 0.976. In order to avoid potential population stratification, we used the inflation factor to adjust individual p-values. Figure 1 shows the logarithmic quantile–quantile (QQ) plot of SNP-based association results. After adjustment by the genomic control approach there is no evidence of population stratification is observed. Figure 2 is Manhattan plot of the discovery sample.\n\nWe identified 29 SNPs located in the FTO gene demonstrated associations with LMI in the discovery sample (p < 10−2). LD analysis showed that these 29 SNPs were in LD (r2 ≥ 0.91) and were located within two LD blocks (Figure 3). These SNPs were replicated in independent Caucasian replication samples (Table 2). Meta-analysis p-values ranging from 5.92 × 10−12 to 1.69 × 10−9. SNP rs17817964 is the most significant SNP with combined p = 5.92 × 10−12 in discovery sample and two replication samples of Caucasian. There are 6 SNPs with p value less than 1 × 10−11. Forest plot of SNPs with combined p < 1 × 10−11 was drawn in Figure 4. Regional plot of the gene FTO was drawn by LocusZoom in Figure 5.\n\nThe results of biological functional annotation using HaploReg v4.1, Regulome DB and GTEx are performed in Table 3. 25 SNPs may locate in a strong enhancer region marked by peaks of several active histone methylation modifications (H3K27ac, H3K9ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3). SNP rs17817288 (discovery p = 2.44 × 10−3, combined p = 5.44 × 10−11) occupies promoter histone marks in muscle satellite cultured cells. It was predicted to have enhancer activity by chromatin states, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks in skeletal muscle myoblasts cells and H3k4me1 marks in muscle satellite cultured cells. Besides it has promoter activity, implied by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac in muscle satellite cultured cells and H3K9ac in HSMM skeletal muscle myoblasts cells. Among the 29 SNPs evaluated with Regulome DB, 7 had no data. Of the 22 SNPs for which Regulome DB provided a score, 2 had a score of <3 (likely to affect the binding) including rs17817964 and rs7202116 with Regulome DB score = 2b respectively. Analyses using GTEx data reveal 11 SNPs of our GWAS results have strong signals of cis-eQTL for FTO gene in skeletal muscle tissue (p < 1 × 10−4). SNPs rs7201850 and rs8044769 were deposited in the GTEx eQTL database as a cis-eQTL for FTO in skeletal muscle with the same direction of effect (p = 1 × 10−5, Figure 6). Gene-gene interaction networks shows there are some connections between FTO and IGF-1, myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs: MYF5, MYOD1, MYOG, and MYF6) and IRX3, implying that FTO may play an important role in muscle development (Figure 7)."

    "content": "Results\n\nCharacteristics of the population\n\nTable 1 contains a summary of the descriptive characteristics of the 998 students and staff from the University of Chicago and the University of Georgia included in this study. All participants are of European ancestry. Of these, 617 (61.8%) are women and 381 (38.2%) are men, with a mean age of 21.67 ± 3.31 years and mean BMI of 24.06 ± 4.61 kg/m2. People with underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity represented 4.1%, 64.3%, 21.7% and 9.9% of the sample population, respectively. The genotype distribution of the FTO rs3751812 SNP is 33.1% GG (N = 330), 49.1% GT (N = 490) and 17.8% TT (N = 178). The rs3751812 T allele frequency was 42.4% in our sample, which was similar to the frequency reported in the European subpopulation of the 1000 Genomes Project (41.4%). A total of 14 impulsivity parameters grouped into three categories (impulsive choice, impulsive action, and impulsive personality) are outlined in Table 1.\n\nAssociation of impulsivity traits with BMI\n\nTable 2 presents a summary of the association of 14 impulsivity parameters with BMI, adjusted for sex, age and site. Within the three broad domains of impulsivity (impulsive choice, impulsive action, impulsive personality traits), 4 parameters were associated with BMI. From the impulsive choice domain, delay discounting of rewards area under the curve (Beta (B) = −0.021 ± 0.009, P = 0.018), delay discounting of rewards average of log transformation of k index for large, medium, and small items (B = 0.011 ± 0.004, P = 0.004) were associated with BMI. From the impulsive action domain, Conner’s continuous performance test (B = 0.0008 ± 0.0004, P = 0.027), and from the impulsive personality traits domain, negative urgency (B = 0.011 ± 0.005, P = 0.030) were associated with BMI. As delay discounting of rewards area under the curve has a reverse relationship to impulsivity, the direction of the effects for the 4 parameters is consistent with a higher BMI being associated with more impulsivity (Table 2).\n\nAssociation of FTO rs3751812 with BMI\n\nThe rs3751812 minor allele T was associated with a higher BMI (B = 0.007 ± 0.003, P = 0.03) in the young adult population.\n\nAssociation of FTO rs3751812 with impulsivity traits\n\nTable 3 contains a summary of the association of rs3751812 SNP with 14 impulsivity traits adjusted for sex, age, and site. The same analysis adjusted for BMI was performed to test if BMI drives the association between FTO and impulsivity traits. The rs3751812 minor allele T was associated with 2 traits in the impulsive personality domain. These include lack of premeditation and lack of perseverance. When not adjusted for BMI, the P values were 0.009 (B = −0.050 ± 0.019) and 0.010 (B = −0.052 ± 0.020), respectively. When adjusted for BMI, the P values were 0.009 (B = −0.050 ± 0.019) and 0.017 (B = −0.048 ± 0.020), respectively. The direction of the effect was negative for both traits, meaning that the obesity risk allele is associated with more premeditation and more perseverance (Table 3). No association was found between rs3751812 and the remaining 12 traits, before and after adjusting for BMI.\n\nRelationships between FTO rs3751812, impulsivity traits and BMI\n\nWe adjusted the association test between FTO rs3751812 and BMI for sex, age, site, lack of premeditation and lack of perseverance, separately and together. The aforementioned association between rs3751812 and BMI unadjusted for impulsive personality traits was B = 0.007 ± 0.003 (P = 0.03). The association between rs3751812 and BMI survived after adjusting for lack of premeditation (B = 0.007 ± 0.003, P = 0.04), but not for lack of perseverance (B = 0.007 ± 0.003, P = 0.06). The association did not remain significant after simultaneously adjusting for the two impulsive personality traits (B = 0.007 ± 0.003, P = 0.05)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nThe FTO SNPs passed all quality control screening (see). Minor allele frequencies of the FTO SNPs ranged from 0.41 to 0.45. Missing genotypes were found for four AN cases in two SNPs and the difference in missingness was not significant between cases and controls (p>0.50). All seven SNPs satisfied Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.24 in controls). All pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (r2) values among the seven SNPs ranged between 0.81 and 1.\n\nTable 1 presents the uncorrected and corrected p-values for the most significant SNPs from the association analyses, accounting for affection status and the interaction between SNP and affection status. (Since all SNP pairs have high linkage disequilibrium, the results for the SNPs not shown are similar). The lowest uncorrected p-value obtained for all SNP analyses was 0.021, which corresponds to an FDR of 0.47, suggesting no significant phenotype-genotype association.\n\nAfter FDR correction for multiple comparisons, no significant associations were found for any of the FTO SNPs genotyped with eating disorder phenotypes or measures of trait anxiety, harm-avoidance, novelty seeking, impulsivity, obsessionality, compulsivity, or concern over mistakes, in cases or controls. Among the cases only, there were also no significant associations between FTO SNPs and the drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, or bulimia scales.\n\nGiven the preliminary nature of this study, we sought to inform future research in this area by exploring some of the non-significant trends identified in the current sample that may warrant examination in subsequent studies. In uncorrected tests, highest lifetime BMI was significantly higher for individuals with one or two copies of the rs7193144 at-risk C allele as compared to those homozygous for the T allele (p<.033). Similarly, lowest lifetime BMI was significantly higher among individuals carrying one or two copies of the rs3751812 at-risk T allele as compared to individuals homozygous for the G allele (p<.021). These results are consistent with the expected effects of these SNPs on BMI and obesity risk based on previous evidence; however, the non-significant corrected FDR values for these effects suggest the findings may be spurious."

    "content": "Results\n\nThe age of the 20,488 participants ranged from 20 to 85 years with an average age of 58.5 years across the cohorts (Table 1). The fraction of men included in each cohort varied from 0% to 43%. In all studies that included both genders, men had on average a lower BMI than the women. Participants in the Hypertensive Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) had the highest BMI while participants in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) had the lowest BMI. The obesity rate (defined as BMI≥30 kg/m2) across the studies was 46% ranging from 31% to 58%.\n\nThe targeted 16q12.2/FTO fine-mapping region spans 646 kb from 53,539,509 to 54,185,773 (build 37) on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q12.2), including the large FTO gene (411 kb) as well as 198 kb downstream of FTO, which includes the RPGRIP1L gene and 37 kb upstream of FTO (Figure 1). On average, we successfully genotyped or imputed one SNP per 172 bp ( = 646,264 bp/3,756 SNPs). The allele frequency distribution of the 3,756 SNPs in this region is shown in Table 2. In contrast to GWAS platforms, a large fraction of SNPs have allele frequencies <5% (52.5%), including 16.7% with allele frequency <1%. Twenty-one SNPs are within the exons of FTO and RPGRIP1L, of which 7 are synonymous and 14 are missense (2 synonymous and 4 missense are located in FTO).\n\nThe most significant SNPs in the 16q12.2/FTO fine-mapping region was rs56137030 (p-value 8.3×10−6), which showed no evidence for heterogeneity (p = 0.13; Table 3). Each A allele of this variant (allele frequency = 0.12) increased BMI by 1.35% (95% confidence interval (0.76%–1.95%). Table 3 also displays results for the three next most significant SNPs showing similar significant associations (p-values 1.4×10−5 to 1.1×10−5) and Table S1 shows results separately for each study. All three SNPs were correlated with rs56137030 (r2≥0.73 in AA and r2≥0.91 in EA; Table S2). rs56137030 and the three next most significant SNPs are located in intron 1 of the FTO gene, approximately in the middle of the region (Figure 1). The nine GWAS index SNPs previous highlighted in EA studies are also located in the same intron 1 FTO region and results for these nine GWAS index SNPs are provided in Table 3 showing p-values<0.05 for five out of the nine index SNPs (0.03 to 3.0×10−4).\n\nThe most significant variant, rs56137030, was correlated at r2>0.5 with 103 SNPs in Europeans (Figure 1a), including eight of the nine GWAS index SNPs (Table S2). In contrast in AAs rs56137030 was correlated with only 28 SNPs at r2>0.5 (Table S2, Figure 1b). All 28 variants correlated with rs56137030 in AA showed some evidence of association with BMI (p-values 0.0057 to 1.1×10−5) and no or limited evidence of heterogeneity (all p for heterogeneity >0.04). To investigate if any of these correlated SNPs were associated with BMI independently from rs56137030 we adjusted each SNP for rs56137030 (including rs56137030 and a second SNP simultaneously in one model). None of these variants remained significant at p<0.05 (Table S2). As expected, the p-values of rs56137030 were also less significant in these conditional analyses, particularly for SNPs highly correlated in AA, demonstrating that these findings are not independent. All 28 SNPs correlated with rs56137030 (r2>0.5) in AA are located between 53,800,954 and 53,845,487, spanning a 44.5 kb region about 104.8 kb downstream of the exon 1 boundary, and ending about 1.4 Kb after exon 2 ends [no variant in exon 2 was genotyped or imputed and, to our knowledge, only 3 variants (rs116753298, rs149393601, and chr16:53844100) all with allele frequency <0.1% have been reported in FTO exon 2 so far ].\n\nTo predict the molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic association signals, and to identify candidate variants for functional follow-up, rs56137030 and variants in LD (r2>0.5; n = 28) were assessed for overlap with eleven different genome-wide functional annotation datasets (Table S3, Material and Methods). Among these 29 variants, six (rs11642015, rs17817497, rs3751812, rs17817964, rs62033408, and rs1421085) were located within candidate intronic regulatory elements, including two (rs3751812 and rs1421085) that were within highly sequence-conserved elements among vertebrates, and two (rs11642015 and rs1421085) that were predicted to have allele-specific binding affinities for different transcription factors. Specifically, we predicted that only the T allele at rs11642015 binds Paired box protein 5 (PAX5) and that the C allele at rs1421085 has a substantially reduced binding affinity for Cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1; Figure S1).\n\nOutside the known FTO intron 1 region, we observed no strong evidence for a second independent signal: When we adjusted each SNP for rs56137030 the most significant SNPs outside of the FTO intron 1 region was a SNP located at position 53710931 (no rs number reported) intronic of the neighbor gene RPGRIP1L (conditional p-value 7.7×10−4) followed by rs8051873 in intron 8 of FTO (conditional p-value 0.0011).\n\n Table S4 shows results for variants highlighted in previous AA studies. Of these nine SNPs only two SNPs had a p-values<0.05 (rs3751812, p value 0.0012)."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nThe obesity risk variants and their allele frequencies among controls for each ethnic group are described in Supplemental Table 1. Allele frequencies in whites in the MEC were similar to those observed in populations of European descent.\n\nAmong the MEC controls, we confirmed the positive associations between BMI and 13 variants in 6 loci (BDNF, FTO, KCTD15, NEGR1, NRXN3 and SH2B1) and also between BMI-adjusted waist circumference and 19 SNPs in 10 loci (the 6 loci above plus LYPLAL1, MSRA, SEC16B and TMEM18) (reported separately by the PAGE consortium).\n\nCases were slightly older than controls (Table 1). After controlling for age, cases were more likely than controls to have a higher BMI and personal history of diabetes, to be a former smoker, with higher mean pack-years among smokers, and to have consumed more alcohol. Cases had slightly fewer years of education and were likely to consume less multivitamins, dietary fiber and total calcium. Among women, cases were less likely to use postmenopausal hormone treatment than controls.\n\nIn the main effect analysis of the obesity risk variants on colorectal cancer, adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity, two out of the 24 SNPs showed a significant association (Table 2; results for all SNPs are shown in Supplemental Table 2). The KCTD15 rs29941 obesity risk allele (C) was associated with a lower colorectal cancer risk, whereas the MC4R rs17782313 obesity risk allele (C) showed a positive association with colorectal cancer. Further adjustments for BMI or for the risk factors that differed between cases and controls in Table 1 did not materially change the risk estimates (i.e., difference <10%). However, neither association was statistically significant when corrected for multiple comparisons, either by FDR-adjustment (adjusted p-value for both rs29941 and rs17782313 = 0.24), by case-control status permutation in sex/race/SNP-strata (permutation p-value = 0.056 for rs29941, p = 0.060 for rs17782313) or by the FPRP approach (FPRP = 0.650 for rs17782313 and 0.752 for rs29941, at a prior probability level of 0.01 and power to detect an OR of 1.5). Similarly, haplotypes estimated from the 8 FTO variants and 2 KCTD15 variants did not show a significant association with CRC (Supplemental Table 3).\n\nWe also examined individuals’ risk score by summing the number of risk alleles for the 15 loci (including two SNPs in low linkage disequilibrium (LD) for BDNF, rs8050136 for FTO, and rs29941 for KCTD15). The risk score, ranging between 4 and 22, showed a significant positive association with BMI (p <0.0001) but not with colorectal cancer (p = 0.47). The MC4R rs17782313 variant, but not KCTD15 rs29941, showed a slightly stronger association with rectal cancer (n = 444 cases; OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.10–1.51) than with colon cancer (n = 1,369 cases; OR = 1.07, 0.96–1.18; p-heterogeneity = 0.03).\n\nIn a subgroup (1,640 cases, 8,878 controls) that had 109 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) data available, the SNP-colorectal cancer associations were examined with and without adjustment for the four principal components that represented the differential AIMs patterns for the 5 race/ethnic groups in the cohort. The results were similar, indicating no evidence of population stratification (data not shown).\n\nBMI was positively associated with colorectal cancer risk (OR for a 5 kg/m2 increment = 1.19, 95% CI 1.12–1.26), with a slightly stronger association for colon cancer (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.29) than for rectal cancer (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.99–1.23), as reported previously. These risk estimates were not changed after adjustment for the rs29941 and rs17782313 variants (data not shown).\n\nBecause some of the obesity variants have shown different associations with obesity phenotypes by sex, race, or physical activity, we tested for evidence of heterogeneity. Results for FTO and KCTD15 that showed significant heterogeneity by weight status in some or all variants examined are presented in Table 2 (Phet <0.05). Three of the 8 variants in FTO (r2 of 80–95% in whites, 54–98% in the other ethnic groups) and both KCTD15 variants (rs11084753 and rs29941; r2 ranging from 31% in African Americans to 60% in Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians) had a significant inverse association with colorectal cancer among obese individuals, but not among normal-weight or overweight individuals. As in the main effects analysis, adjusting for BMI did not yield a notable change in the risk estimates (data not shown).\n\nThe SNP-cancer associations did not vary across ethnicity (see Supplemental Table 4), except for the NRXN3 rs10146997 variant, which was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in whites only (p-heterogeneity = 0.02). Similarly, there was no evidence of heterogeneity by sex, age (by median age of 70) or physical activity (by median 1.60 METs; data not shown)."

    "content": "3. Results\n\nOut of the twenty SNPs involved in the present analysis, nine showed no significant association with any obesity- or WC-related phenotype in neither of the populations under investigation (namely rs10938397 (GNPDA2), rs1137101 (LEPR), rs1501299, rs2241766 (ADIPOQ), rs17782313 (MC4R), rs6265, rs925946 (BDNF), rs659366, and rs660339 (UCP2)). \n\n3.1. Characteristics of the Study Samples\n\nAs shown in Table 1, a total of 2637 subjects were included in the analysis, 1496 and 1141 from the HG and HR populations, respectively. There was a higher proportion of females in the HR population compared to that of the HG population. The mean age of the HG group was higher than that of HR group, thus all calculations were adjusted for sex and age. Mean values for BMI and WC and the prevalence of central obesity (according to ATPIII and European and Asian criteria of IDF) were higher in the case of the HG population.\n\nIn addition, the HG population displayed a consistently higher frequency of central obesity, as well as larger waist size and BMI compared to the HR sample, independently of classification applied for abdominal/central obesity.\n\n3.2. Individual Effects of SNPs in the Hungarian General and Roma Population\n\nThe effect of the SNPs exhibiting significant associations with BMI and/or WC (as continuous outcomes) separately for each study population are shown in Table 2. Altogether, four SNPs (rs1121980, rs1558902, rs9939609, and rs9941349) located in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene showed significant association with WC (as a continuous outcome) in both populations. The same four SNPs also showed a significant positive association with BMI in the HG population, and only two of them (rs9939609 and rs9941349) in the Roma population. \n\nThe rs1801282, located in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) gene, was significantly associated with decreased waist circumference as a continuous outcome only in the HR population (HG: β = 0.340, SE: 0.724, p = 0.638; HR β = –3.507, SE: 1.699, p = 0.039; p = 0.029 for difference in association). This SNP had a large protective effect against increased WC but did not have any significant effect on BMI in the HR population. A protective effect of this extent was not observed for any of the obesity phenotypes in the HG sample. Effect sizes for WC were consistently stronger in both populations, compared to generalized obesity, suggesting that the risk for obesity in both populations is primarily dependent on abdominal obesity.\n\nFurther comparisons (Figure 1) were made by computing ORs for obesity (Figure 1A), WC by ATPIII (Figure 1B) and WC by IDFEURO (Figure 1C), and IDFASIA (Figure 1D). When comparing associations of SNPs for obesity (Figure 1A), all four FTO variants displayed a similar significant association in both the HG and HR groups. rs16139 in the neuropeptide Y gene (NPY) had a significant effect on obesity (Figure 1A) only in the HG, while all other SNPs showed no association with obesity in either population. In the case of the WC ATPIII phenotype (Figure 1B), three SNPs (rs1558902, rs9939609, and rs9941349 in FTO) showed a significant effect in HR population (Figure 1B) and one (rs12970134 which is localized near the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene), had a significant effect on WC in the HG population (Figure 1B).\n\nComparisons based on IDFEURO (Figure 1C) showed two SNPs (rs2867125 and rs6548238—located in the transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18) gene) significantly associated with WC in HG. In the case of IDFASIA (Figure 1D), no significant association was observed in HR. A summary of SNPs associated with obesity- and WC-related phenotypes as continuous outcomes, is presented in the supplementary Figure S3.\n\n3.3. The Results of Different Genetic Models for the rs1801282 Gene Polymorphism in PPARγ\n\nWe used four genetic models (i.e., codominant, dominant, recessive, and over-dominant) to further examine the effect of the rs1801282 in PPARγ on the WC as a continuous outcome (Table 3). There was a significant association between SNP and outcome in the Roma population with a dominant genetic model. Furthermore, it was found that the direction of the effect of the rs1801282 differed in both study populations regardless of the genetic model. No significant difference in the risk susceptibility for this SNP was observed, with or without obesity phenotypes among HG or HR, when considering other generalized and centralized obesity criteria in further genetic models (Tables S6–S9).\n\nFor PPARγ SNP (rs1801282) the allelic frequency was significantly higher among Roma (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 2.18–3.46), with ethnicity status as an outcome."

Among these 52 SNPs, rs8050136 (p-value = 7.80 × 10− 10), rs9939609 (p-value = 1.32 × 10− 9), rs1421085 (p-value = 1.54 × 10− 8), rs9941349 (p-value = 9.05 × 10− 8), rs1121980 (p-value = 7.27 × 10− 7), and rs9937354 (p-value = 6.65 × 10− 7) were the top ranking SNPs, and all located in the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) block (Additional file 1: Figure S1) in the intron 1 of FTO gene. Nine additional SNPs showed statistical significance using the Bonferroni correction criteria (p-value < 9.6 × 10− 4 [0.05/52]). Seven SNPs flanked six loci as follows: RBFOX1 (rs12925846 [p-value = 6.21 × 10− 6], and rs17235335 [p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5]), RP11-638 L3.1 (rs2126015, p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5), TMTC1 (rs159702, p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5), CBLN4 (rs6069477, p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5), CSMD3 (rs16883931, p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5), and ERBB4 (rs6757087, p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5). Two SNPs, rs11626956 (p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5), and rs9808434 (p-value = 1.26 × 10− 5) were located in an intergenic region."

    "content": "Results\n\nSelected baseline characteristics of cases and controls\n\nTable 1 summarizes selected baseline characteristics of cases and controls. Cases were more likely to be overweight, and also tended to have more experience with smoking and a family history of colorectal cancer than controls. Table 1 also shows plasma concentrations of three adipokines among cases and controls. Although there was no material difference between the two groups, controls tended to have higher plasma concentrations of total and HMW adiponectin than cases.\n\nAssociation of SNPs in the FTO gene with the risk of colorectal cancer\n\nPrior to investigating the association between the eight candidate SNPs of the FTO gene and the risk of colorectal cancer, we first tested whether genotype frequencies among controls were consistent with those predicted under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using the χ2 test statistics, and found no inconsistency except for rs6499640 (P HWE = 0.01). We then conducted a haplotype analysis excluding rs6499640, and found that the remaining seven SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium with R2> 0.8 (Fig 2). As highly expected, all seven SNPs in the FTO gene demonstrated a similar positive association with the incidence of colorectal cancer (Table 2), and most evidently for rs1558902, rs8050136, rs3751812, and rs9939609 (Ptrend = 0.02). In the case of rs8050136, carriers of the obesity risk A allele had a 36% elevated risk for colorectal cancer (95% CI, 2–83%) compared to non-carriers.\n\nAssociation of pre-diagnostic plasma adipokine levels with the risk of colorectal cancer\n\nTable 3 shows the association between plasma concentrations of the three adipokines and the risk colorectal cancer. Plasma leptin levels were positively associated with the incidence of colorectal cancer (Ptrend = 0.04), with a multivariate adjusted OR of colorectal cancer for the highest compared to the lowest quintile of 1.80 (95% CI, 1.12–2.88). In contrast, a non-linear inverse association was suggested for total and HMW adiponectin (Ptrend = 0.10 and 0.13, respectively): using the first quintile as reference, the second presented a decrease in the multivariate adjusted OR of colorectal cancer, whereas the third to fifth presented no further decline. Additional adjustment for BMI considerably attenuated the associations of plasma adipokines with the risk of colorectal cancer, but an elevated risk was still statistically significant for plasma leptin levels. Compared to the lowest quintile of plasma leptin, the highest demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the BMI-adjusted OR of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.00–3.16; P = 0.04).\n\nInteraction between SNPs in the FTO gene and pre-diagnostic plasma adipokine levels on colorectal cancer risk\n\nFinally, we investigated the interaction between SNPs in the FTO gene and plasma adipokine levels on colorectal cancer risk. In Table 4, we presented the results of rs8050136 only, because rs8050136 and the other six SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium, and all demonstrated closely similar results. Compared to non-carriers in the lowest quintile of leptin, carriers of the obesity risk A allele in the highest quintile had a substantially increased risk of colorectal cancer (multivariate adjusted OR = 2.55; 95% CI, 1.21–5.39), although the interaction was not statistically significant (Pinteraction = 0.30). Of interest, we observed a statistically significant interaction of rs8050136 with total adiponectin (Pinteraction = 0.03), but only a marginal interaction with HMW adiponectin (Pinteraction = 0.16). Compared to non-carriers in the lowest quintile of total adiponectin, carriers of the obesity risk A allele in the same quintile showed a considerably elevated risk of colorectal cancer with the multivariate adjusted OR of 2.54 (95% CI, 1.36–4.75), while the corresponding OR was 2.18 (95% CI, 1.14–4.16) for HMW adiponectin."

    "content": "Results\n\nOverview of analyses\n\nAll continuous measures were first examined for distributional properties. Only epinephrine exhibited a significant departure from normality. The raw values were log transformed, and the log transformed values were used in all subsequent analyses. Since all analyses were planned a priori, and because of the difficulty in detecting interactions in field studies, critical alpha was maintained at .05 for all analyses. We first explored demographics and baseline physical activity to assess the success of random assignment. We then conducted attrition analyses to determine whether differential attrition generally or by condition occurred across the course of the study. Missing data were approached via the use of full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation, whereby all possible data points are utilized and missing values are iteratively estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Analyses on intervention outcomes were conducted in a random coefficient regression (RCR) framework via SAS Proc Mixed, which takes into account the longitudinal nature of the data and implements FIML estimation of missing data within the analysis. Moderator analyses were also conducted in a RCR framework.\n\nDemographics\n\nDuring the baseline assessment, 19 individuals reported more than 90 minutes of voluntary physical activity in the past week according to the PAR assessment. These individuals were not considered “inactive” and were therefore dropped from the analysis. Thus, the sample used here included 219 individuals. Table 1 provides baseline characteristics across the two intervention groups and outcome variables at 12-months. On average, the sample was 28.20 years of age (sd = 7.95). The majority were White (67.1%), were predominantly female (80.4%), had an average of 15.83 years of education (sd = 2.60), and more than half had a total household income of $50,000 or more (55.2%). Participants reported engaging in 17.58 minutes (sd = 26.58) of at least moderate-intensity exercise over the past week, with a majority (59.8%) being completely sedentary and half (50%) fell into the normal weight range on BMI (18.5-24.9). There were no significant differences between the groups on any baseline demographic data.\n\nAttrition\n\nAttrition analyses were conducted with regard to who was retained versus not retained at the 12-month follow-up. To examine whether there were differential rates of attrition by condition, a series of ANOVAs were conducted to examine the interaction between attrition at 12-month follow-up (retained vs. not retained) and condition (COSTRIDE versus HW) on pretest measures of key demographic and behavioral constructs. Of 13 tests conducted, there were only two significant effects. Participants with lower levels of self-reported frequency of exercise at baseline were significantly more likely to be retained at the 12-month follow-up ( p = .004), although this did not differ by condition and baseline levels of behavior are included in every analysis of behavior change over the trial. There was also a significant retentionXcondition interaction for gender, such that males were less likely to be retained in the HW condition (p = .02). Thus all main intervention analyses on outcomes were repeated controlling for gender.\n\nMain effects of the intervention on physical activity outcomes\n\nPAR minutes\n\nIn the first analysis, PAR minutes reported at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months served as the dependent measure, and condition (COSTRIDE versus HW) and time were the independent variables. There was a significant timeXcondition interaction on PAR minutes (est. = 14.85, se = 7.47, p = .047). Participants in both conditions increased their moderate intensity physical activity minutes from baseline to 6 months, but those in the COSTRIDE condition appeared better able to maintain those gains from the 6-month to 12-month follow-up (see Figure 3). Simple effects tests confirmed that the COSTRIDE and HW conditions were not different in PAR minutes at the 6 months, but this difference was significant at 12 months (p = .02). Outcomes were unchanged after controlling for gender.\n\nFrequency of aerobic exercise\n\nIn the second analysis, past 3-month frequency of exercise reported at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months served as the dependent measure. There was a significant timeXcondition interaction on frequency of exercise (est. = .09, se = .03, p = .006). Participants in the COSTRIDE condition increased their frequency of exercise from baseline to 3 months and then maintained that change over time, while participants in the HW condition actually decreased their frequency of exercise from baseline to 3 months and, similarly, maintained that behavior (see Figure 4). Simple effects tests confirmed that the COSTRIDE and HW conditions were not different in reported frequency of exercise at baseline, nor at the 9 month follow-up. However, the conditions were significantly different at the 3 month (p = .002), 6 month (p = .02), and 12-month assessments (p = .004). The significant intervention effect was unchanged after controlling for gender.\n\nVO2 max\n\nVO2 max at baseline and then at 12 months served as the dependent measure. There was no significant timeXcondition interaction on VO2max (est. = .30, se = .52, p = .55). In the HW condition, VO2 max went from a mean of 33.23 ml/kg/min (sd = 7.10) at baseline to a mean of 33.39 ml/kg/min (sd = 7.57) at 12 months. In the COSTRIDE condition, VO2 max went from a mean of 34.06 ml/kg/min (sd = 8.16) at baseline to a mean of 34.92 ml/kg/min (sd = 8.49) at 12 months.\n\nThe three outcome measures were most certainly assessing three different, though related, dimensions of physical activity. The correlations between outcomes before and after 12 months of participation in COSTRIDE or HW were high for the self-reported outcomes, but much smaller for VO2 max. At both baseline and 12-month follow-up, past 7-day PAR minutes was significantly and positively associated with past 3-month frequency of exercise (r = .20, p = 004 and r = .64, p < .001, respectively) and VO2 max (r = .15, p = .03 and r = .29, p < .001, respectively). Frequency of exercise was not associated with VO2 max at baseline (r = .08), but was significantly and positively associated at 12 months (r = .24, p = .002).\n\nModeration of intervention effects on physical activity outcomes\n\nFor each moderator tested, we estimated a RCR wherein condition, time, the moderator (centered when necessary), and all possible interactions served as the independent variables. The test of primary interest in these analyses is the timeXconditionXmoderator interaction.\n\nGenetic factors\n\nThe BDNF SNP (rs6265) did not moderate the intervention effects on past 7-day PAR minutes, but it did moderate intervention effects on past 3-month frequency of exercise (est. = .14, se = .069, p < .05). COSTRIDE participants with two copies of the G allele exercised less frequently in the past three months than individuals with at least one copy of the A allele, while individuals with an A allele in the HW condition were the least active (Figure 5). There was no moderation of intervention effects on VO2 max by the BDNF SNP, however there was a marginal main effect of the SNP on overall levels of VO2 max (est. = 3.06, se = 1.59, p = .056). The estimated means indicated that A/A and A/G individuals had higher overall VO2 max (M = 34.99, se = .84) than G/G individuals (M = 33.58, se = .64). There was no moderation of intervention effects on 7-day PAR minutes by a SNP in the FTO gene (rs8044769). However, there was evidence for the moderation of intervention effects on past 3-month frequency of exercise by this FTO SNP (est. = -.15, se = .076, p = .05). COSTRIDE participants with two copies of the C allele exercised more frequently, while individuals with at least one copy of the T allele exercised less frequently (Figure 6). There was no moderation of intervention effects on VO2 max by this FTO SNP. Additionally, there was no moderation of intervention effects on PAR minutes, voluntary aerobic exercise, or VO2 max by the other SNPs examined.\n\nPhysiological responses to exercise\n\nIn order to explore the extent to which physiological responses to exercise moderated intervention outcomes, it was necessary to compute slopes that characterized the response during exercise for each of our physiological moderators. We utilized a RCR framework in SAS Version 9.2 to model linear changes in the response over the course of the submaximal exercise challenge. These analyses produced individual within-subject regression slopes that characterized each individual’s change in, for example, heart rate over the course of the bout of exercise. These slopes then served as an additional predictor in the overall RCR models assessing intervention effects. There was no significant moderation of intervention effects on past 7-day PAR minutes, past 3-month aerobic exercise, or VO2max by lactate, temperature, systolic blood pressure, norepinephrine or heart rate response to a bout of moderate intensity exercise.\n\nSubjective experience of exercise\n\nNext, the extent to which the subjective experience of moderate intensity exercise moderated intervention outcomes was tested. The same strategy of computing within-subjects regression slopes for each of our measures of subjective experience was utilized. There was no significant moderation of intervention effects on past 7-day PAR minutes, past 3-month aerobic exercise, or VO2max by perceived pain or affective response to a bout of moderate intensity exercise."

    "content": "3. Results\n\n3.1. Literature Search\n\nThe search strategy and the number of hints per each search are shown in Supplementary Appendix pp 1-2. A total of 3,519 published records were identified through searches (Figure 1). A total of 718 studies were excluded based on duplication, and titles/abstracts of 2913 records were screened. Of these, 341 were included for full-text review, and 4 additional studies were obtained from screening the references of included studies. A total of 44 studies consisting of 8 GWAS/linkage studies, 4 pedigree/familial studies, 19 candidate gene association studies, and 13 population/hospital-based cross-sectional studies were included. Figure S1 shows the linear growth over time of heritability, family history, and genetic studies on T2DM published in SSA. Up to 45.8% of genetic studies were published between 2011 and 2015, and 66.7% of FH and heritability were published between 2011 and 2019.\n\n3.2. Pedigree and Family Studies on T2DM in SSA\n\nAlthough few published studies have thoroughly investigated the heritability of T2DM within the SSA context, these studies demonstrate a distinct familial aggregation of T2DM and offered useful insights into the pattern of heritability of T2DM.\n\nThe reports of Meiloud et al. among 609 known T2DM Mauritanian patients indicated that 27% of T2DM patients have at least one relative with the condition. The association between PFH and T2DM was observed to be higher among first-degree compared to second-degree relatives (p = 0.003). Moreover, more probands with an affected mother than those with affected father were observed, suggesting a preferential maternal effect which does not extend to second-degree relatives.\n\nSimilar to the above findings, a prospective case-control study among 1,111 T2DM and 687 controls from the Black South African population reported 27.3% of T2DM having a PFH compared with 8.4% in the control group (p < 0.01). Also, first-degree relatives with T2DM had a significant maternal aggregation of 64.7% compared with 27% of those who had diabetic fathers (p < 0.01). In addition to these, Erasmus et al. reported that patients with PFH had an earlier onset (<50 years) of diabetes than those with NFH (p < 0.01).\n\nTwo of the studies included in this review reported severe pancreatic beta-cell secretory dysfunction among Ghanaian and Cameroonian offspring of T2DM patients compared with those of nondiabetic parents. Amoah et al. compared β-cell secretion, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity (Si), and glucose effectiveness (Sg) among 42 healthy nondiabetic first-degree relatives and 22 healthy control subjects without a PFH The mean total and acute first and second phases of serum insulin and c-peptide responses after oral glucose tolerance test at t = 60, 90, and 120 minutes (p < 0.05) were prolonged in relatives than in healthy controls. The level of insulin resistance and glucose effectiveness at basal insulin level (Sg) did not significantly differ in the relatives and healthy controls.\n\nEven though only few studies (<5) have investigated the familial aggregation of T2DM in SSA, three common themes were identified to be associated with T2DM heritability. Firstly, preference for maternal aggregation was higher among first degree compared to second-degree relatives; secondly, probands manifested a degree of β-cell impairment marked by reduced early-phase insulin secretion; and lastly, T2DM onset was early (<50 years) among relatives of diabetic individuals.\n\n3.3. Genome-Wide Association/Linkage Studies\n\nThe two maiden genome-wide linkage study in SSA among the Akan and Ga, from Ghana, Yoruba, and Igbo from Nigeria identified significant linkage signal regions on 10q23 and 4p15, while few other regions had logarithm odd (LOD) scores considered as suggestive evidence of linkage.\n\nUsing an affected sibling pair (ASP) approach with 390 short tandem repeat markers typed in 343 families in the African American Diabetes Mellitus (AADM) study, a multipoint linkage analysis identified suggestive evidence of linkage in four regions on three chromosomes; 12 (LOD = 1.92), 19 (LOD = 1.81), and 20 (LOD = 2.63), with the strongest evidence on 20q13.3 (LOD = 1.80). This region was previously identified as a T2DM susceptible locus in a non-African population. In addition, 12q24 linkage signal was identified, as has been previously reported as T2DM susceptible locus.\n\nChen et al. employed the multipoint linkage approach performed on log C-peptide using the AADM samples. Significant linkage signals were observed on 10q23 (LOD = 4.04), 4p15 (LOD = 3.48), 15q14 (LOD = 2.41), and 18p11 (LOD = 2.18). These regions were identified to harbour five positional candidate genes for T2DM and related complications: the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) in 18p11; the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 (PPARGC1) in 4p15; PTEN, PPP1R5, and IDE in 10q23 (Supplementary Appendix, pp.16).\n\nAdeyemo et al. conducted a study on the evaluation of T2DM susceptibility genome-wide loci in SSA. The study sampled 1775 subjects of which 90% were participants enrolled in the AADM study and 10% of East Africans enrolled from Kenya. The study observed 41 loci showing transferability to African sample: 11 at the exact reported SNP and 30 others at SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the reported SNP. The TCF7L2 SNP rs7903146 showed the strongest association with T2DM (p = 1.61 × 10−8, OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.26–2.15). When the 41 loci that showed transferability were fine-mapped, stronger evidence of association with T2DM was shown by neighbouring SNPs (SLC30A8 and CDKAL1) compared with index SNPs with an exception to the block that contained both TCF7L2 and ZBED3.\n\nIn a recent discovery study by Adeyemo et al. using the population group of West and East Africans, ZRANB3 (lead SNP p = 2.831 × 10−9), which has not been previously associated with T2DM, was identified as an African-specific T2DM locus. The role of ZRANB3 in an experimental model was found to be involved in β-cell functional response to high glucose conditions, thus the capacity of the pancreas to respond to insulinogenic stimuli.\n\nA study by Chen et al. found an association with T2DM using the shared variant (rs7903146) from West, East, and South Africa, the Europeans, and Africans and a distinct African-specific signal, VT11A- rs17746147. Likewise, one novel signal, rs73284431, near alkylglycerol monooxygenase (AGMO: p = 5.2 × 10−9, MAF = 0.095), distinct from previously reported signals in the African region was also detected. This indicates that combining different populations from SSA could possibly lead to the discovery of new and population-specific loci for T2DM.\n\n3.4. Association between PFH and the Risk of T2DM among SSA Population\n\nThirteen studies were identified that provided evidence on the risk of T2DM among the general population. Ten of the studies were population/community-based cross-sectional studies, two were hospital-based case-control studies, and one study was a comparative cross-sectional study. A total of 14,432 participants from the ten cross-sectional studies and the two hospital-based case-control studies were used for meta-analysis. The characteristics of the 12 studies are shown in Table S4 (Supplementary Appendix pp. 10). From the pooled studies, the prevalence of T2DM ranged from 5.4-66.8% among participants with a positive family history (PFH) and 2.5-32.2% among participants with no family history (NFH). The overall prevalence of T2DM among the SSA population with PFH of T2DM was 28.2% compared with 11.2% among participants with NFH (Table 1).\n\nA meta-analysis from the twelve studies demonstrated a significant effect of PFH on T2DM prevalence in SSA [OR = 3.29 (95% CI: 2.40-4.52)] (Figure 2). This effect size was robust in the sensitivity analysis and remained at a significant level following the omission of each single study. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis also revealed that the pooled estimate was much less impacted by odds ratios values from Bello-Ovosi et al., Millogo et al., and Mayega et al. (Figure 3). The funnel plot revealed publication bias, depicted by the asymmetrical display of odds ratios reported by the various studies (Figure 4).\n\n3.5. Candidate Gene Studies\n\nA total of 28 polymorphisms (including SNP, indels, and repeats) in 17 genes were investigated across studies. Supplementary Document: pp. 6-10 shows the distribution of the polymorphisms in various genes, including four in CAPN10 (rs3792267, rs2975762, rs5030952, rs3842570), three in TCF7L2 (rs7903146; rs12255372; DG10S478), and FTO (rs9941349, rs3751812, rs8050136); and two in ACDC (C-11377G, G-11391A) and ENPP1 (rs997509, rs1044498).\n\nA shown in Supplementary Table S3, 8 SNPs in the SCL40A1, PPAR-γ, IRS-1, AGRP, PPAR-α, and CAPN10 genes were examined and were not significantly associated with T2DM or measures of glycaemia across included studies. In single studies, the ABCC8 and Haptoglobin SNPs were found to be associated with T2DM among Nigerians and Ghanaians, respectively. Two polymorphisms in two genes (PSMD6 and C2D4B) were found to be nonsignificantly associated with T2DM in Black South Africans after correcting for multiple testing. Polymorphisms in KCNJ11 (rs5219) was found to be nonsignificantly associated with T2DM among Ghanaian and Nigerian populations but significant among Mauritanians.\n\nOf the three polymorphisms in the FTO gene reported in two studies in two black South African mixed ancestry population, only rs9941349 (OR = 1.43 (1.00-2.04), p = 0.052) was near significance, associated with T2DM after adjustment for cofounders.\n\nWith the two SNPs in ACDC reported among Black South Africans, SNP G-11391-A was found to be protective to T2DM. Of the two SNPs in ENPP1 reported among South-African Mixed ancestry, only rs997509 was found to be significantly associated with T2DM. Also, one SNP in TNF-α (−308 G/A) was reported to be associated with T2DM among the Ethiopian population.\n\nMoreover, all the variants of TCF7L2 reported among Ghanaians, Cameroonians, and Nigerians were found to be significantly associated with T2DM. Among South Africa-Mixed Ancestry, TCF7L2-rs7903146 showed marginal significance whereas TCF7L2-rs12255372 was not significantly associated with T2DM.\n\n3.6. Association between TCF7L2-rs7903146 Risk Variant and T2DM among SSA Population\n\nThe pooled estimate of the effect of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism on T2DM is shown in Figure 5. Across the three studies that assessed the effect of TCF7L2-rs7903146 using the codominant genetic model, the pooled odds ratio was 6.17 (95% CI: 2.03-18.81; I2 = 64.71%, p − heterogeneity = 0.059). The effect of TCF7L2-rs7903146 was 1.75 (95% CI: 1.18-2.59; I2 = 0.00%, p − heterogeneity = 0.859) using the recessive model across two studies; and 2.27 (95% CI: 1.50-3.44; I2 = 0.00%, p − heterogeneity = 0.789) additive model across two studies. These values suggest that the effect of TCF7L2-rs7903146 on T2DM risk is moderately strong among the SSA population with moderate heterogeneity existing across studies."

    "content": "Results\n\nCausal effects of childhood obesity on risks of adult T2D and CAD\n\nIn the main MR analyses based on the IV1 model with 7 valid SNPs that were significantly associated with childhood obesity (Table 1 and Table S1), we found that childhood obesity was associated with a 16% increased risk of adult T2D under the IVW model (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06–1.28; P = .001; Fig. 2) for each unit increase in the log-odds of having childhood obesity. Similar results were obtained under the penalized robust IVW and the weighted median methods (Fig. 2). With the MR-Egger regression method, the intercept term was −0.076 with the 95% CI of −0.161 to 0.008 (P = .080), suggesting that the causal estimate may not be influenced by pleiotropy. There was a modest heterogeneity between the causal estimate by different SNPs under the IVW model (P-heterogeneity = .051), Under the IV2 model with 9 SNPs that were significantly associated with the children obesity (Table 1 and Table S1), we found that childhood obesity was also associated with increased risk of adult T2D; however, the MR-Egger regression suggested that the IVs violated the pleiotropy assumption (P = .028; Table S2). The pleiotropy-adjusted coefficients also supported the causal association between childhood obesity and T2D in adult (β = 0.909, se = 0.308; P = .003).\n\nBased on the IV1 model with 7 valid SNPs that were associated with children obesity, the MR analysis suggested that a 7% increased risk of adult CAD (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02–1.12; P = .004; Fig. 2) was caused by each unit increase in the log-odds of having childhood obesity. The penalized robust IVW and weighted-median models provided similar results (Fig. 2), and the MR-Egger regression method suggested that the causal estimate for childhood obesity on CAD was not influenced by pleiotropy (intercept term = −0.042, se = 0.023; P = .062; Table 2). No significant heterogeneity between the causal estimate was noted between the SNPs under the IVW model (P-heterogeneity = .468), and none of the SNPs significantly influenced the causal estimate, as suggested by the leave-1-out sensitivity analyses. The MR-Egger regression did not identify a violation of pleiotropy assumption under IV2 model (intercept = -0.042, se = 0.023; P = .062), and the pleiotropy-adjusted coefficient also suggested a causal association between childhood obesity and adult CAD (β = 0.306, se = 0.131; P = .019). In addition, the MR analyses based on the IV2 model with 9 SNPs also suggested childhood obesity was associated with increased risk of adult CAD (Table S2).\n\nCausal effect of childhood obesity on adult cardiometabolic traits\n\nBy using the IV1 model (Table 1 and Table S1), we found that per-unit increase in the log-odds of having childhood obesity was causally associated with a 0.192-standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI (β = 0.192, se = 0.018; P = 6.64 × 10–26), a 0.168-SD increase in HC, a 0.155-SD increase in WC, and a 0.066-SD increase in WHR under the conventional IVW model (Table 2). Significant heterogeneity for the causal estimates between individual SNPs was noticed for BMI, WC, and HC but not for WHR (Table 2). Similar results were noticed with the IV2 model with 9 SNPs as the IVs (Table 1 and Table S1) in assessing the causal estimates between childhood obesity and adult BMI, HC, WC, and WHR. The MR-Egger regression suggested that both the IV1 and IV2 model violated the pleiotropy assumption for BMI, HC, and WC but not WHR (Table 2 and Table S2); however, the pleiotropy-adjusted coefficients also suggested that there were significant causal effects of childhood obesity on the anthropometric traits.\n\nFor the glycemic traits, we found that each 1-unit increase in the log-odds of having childhood obesity was causally associated with an increase of 0.025 pmol/L of log-transformed fasting insulin (P = .011) and .025 of log-transformed HOMA-IR (P = .012) in adults based on the conventional IVW method with the IV1 model (Table 1 and Table S1). There was no evidence for the causal effects of childhood obesity on fasting glucose, 2-hour glucose, HbA1c, or the log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of beta-cell (HOMA-B) level in adults. No significant heterogeneity was noticed for the causal estimates between individual SNPs for these traits (Table 2). The MR-Egger regression suggested that the causal associations for glycemic traits were not influenced by the pleiotropy effects. Similar results were noticed with the MR analyses based on the IV2 model with 9 SNPs (Table S2).\n\nFor the lipid traits, each unit increase in the log-odds of having childhood obesity was causally associated with a 0.047-SD reduction in HDL-c and a 0.036-SD increase in TG in adults with IV1 model (Table 1 and Table S1). There was no evidence for the causal effects of childhood obesity on the LDL-c or TC level in adults (Table 2). No significant heterogeneity for the causal estimates between individual SNPs was noticed for the conventional IVW method regarding HDL-c or TC (P-heterogeneity >.05); however, significant heterogeneity for the causal estimates between individual SNPs was noted for LDL-c and TC (P-heterogeneity = .010 and .046, respectively). For all traits, the intercept term estimated in the MR-Egger regression was centered at the origin with a 95% CI including the null, suggesting that the observed results were not influenced by the pleiotropy. Similar results were obtained for the MR analyses based on the IV2 model with 9 SNPs (Table S2).\n\nSensitivity analyses of MR studies\n\nWe performed the leave-1-out sensitivity analyses with the IV1 model using the conventional IVW method to evaluate the causal effects of childhood obesity on the risks of adult T2D and CAD (Figure S1), anthropometric traits (Figure S2), glycemic traits (Figure S3), and lipids (Figure S4) using the summary-level data from GWASs. We did not identify any heterogeneous SNPs that largely influence the causal estimates for childhood obesity on T2D, CAD, and cardiometabolic traits in adults."

    "content": "Results\n\nSummary statistics on body mass by age and sex are shown in Table 1. The results of regression analyses for WFH z-score for the whole sample are tabulated for each SNP in Table 2. Results on BWT, early weight gain and BMI for sample subsets are reported in Additional file 1, Table S2. We observed no association with WFH z-score or other measures of body mass despite reasonable precision. The standard error of the effect size (derived from multiple regression models with covariates) for the WFH z-score was approximately 0.033 units per allele copy, and the corresponding 95% confidence interval less than 0.17, for all SNPs. The confidence intervals for other measures of body mass and all but the three SNPs with the lowest allele frequencies (< 15%; rs3751812, rs9931494 and rs9935403) indicate that the FTO genotype is unlikely to be associated with differences per allele of greater than 0.12 in WFH z-score, 0.74 kg/m2 in BMI among adults, 80 g in BWT and 0.11 z-scores difference in growth rate in the first 2 years of life. The exception was rs3751812, the SNP with much the lowest allele frequency (4.4%). The 95% confidence interval for the WFH z-score of rs9939609 (-0.061, 0.065) did not embrace the lower bound (0.08) for the equivalent effect on BMI z-score reported previously in Europeans.\n\nWe note that dropping covariates made little difference to the effect sizes measured. Reanalysis based on clustering by father (rather than mother) had no effect on our findings. The analysis accounting for possible sex differences did show that no genotype effect varied significantly between the sexes for any body mass outcome.\n\nWe found no association of FTO SNPs with reproductive success (as number of babies born, Table 1), nor with age at first delivery or seasonality of birth (see Additional file 1, Table S2). The confidence intervals indicate that we should have been able to detect a 10% difference in reproductive success."

    "content": "Results\n\nThe results presented are for PEAR study participants on atenolol monotherapy (i.e. the atenolol arm). Baseline characteristics and demographics are shown in Table 1 . Among a total of 384 study participants in the atenolol group, 58.6% were white and 38.3% were African American. Participants were overweight (average BMI = 30.8 kg/m2), and 12.8% were current smokers. The average baseline HDL-C was 49.7 mg/dL.\n\nThe Manhattan plots and corresponding Q-Q plots for HDL-C response to atenolol are shown in Figure S1  and Figure S2 , respectively. No SNPs achieved a Bonferroni correct P-value. Overall, 25 SNPs met the screening P-value (P<1x10-3) in whites and 42 SNPs met the screening P-value in the African Americans; however, no SNP replicated in the other race group, in the same direction. After examining the identified gene regions in the other race for evidence of consistent association, thirteen regions met our threshold for association (P<0.005 or P<0.05 with prior HDL-C or lipid association, Table 2 ). The allele frequencies, genotype counts, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P-values for these SNPs are shown in Table S1 . All SNPs identified in these gene regions were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (Hardy-Weinberg P-value > 0.01).\n\nIn whites, the strongest association was rs10157410 in PLA2G4A (P=6.66x10-5, beta=3.46, Table 2 ), with consistent regional association at rs4648287 in the African Americans (P=0.0040, beta=3.21). PLA2G4A is located at chromosome 1q31.1 and encodes the cytosolic phospholipase A2. In African Americans, the strongest association was seen at rs3213619 on chromosome 7q21.12, with a P-value of 2.74x10-4 and a beta of 5.22 (Table 2 ). rs3213619 lies in ABCB1, ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1, and consistent regional association was also observed at rs10267099 in whites (P=0.0059, beta=1.62).\n\nTwo other regions are of particular note. First, GALNT2, polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2, which has been previously associated in GWAS studies with circulating HDL-C levels, was associated with atenolol induced HDL-C change. In whites the G allele of rs2144300, one of the same SNPs identified from GWAS studies, was associated with an atenolol induced decrease in HDL-C (P=2.29x10-4, Table 2 , Figure 1A ), with a mean HDL-C change of -4.18 mg/dL, -3.03 mg/dL, and -0.63 mg/dL for the GG, GA, and AA genotypes, respectively (Figure 1B ). In African Americans, a signal was observed in GALNT2 with the A allele of rs2144297 and a decrease in HDL-C in response to atenolol (P=0.0233, Table 2 , Figure 1C ). The mean change in HDL-C was -5.39 mg/dL, -3.61 mg/dL, and -1.63 mg/dL for the AA, AG, and GG genotypes, respectively (Figure 1D ).\n\nThe second gene, FTO, the fat mass and obesity associated gene, has been previously associated with BMI, obesity and type 2 diabetes in GWAS, and was recently associated with HDL-C in a large, gene-centric analysis of the CVD array used herein. In African Americans, the A allele of rs12595985 was associated with an increase in HDL-C in response to atenolol treatment, with an increase of 13.03 mg/dL in the AA homozygote, an average decrease of 0.07 mg/dL in AC heterozygotes, and an average decrease of 3.97 mg/dL in CC homozygotes (P=2.90x10-4, Table 2 , Figures 2A  and  2B ). The observed signal in whites was with rs9940629, with the G allele associated with a greater reduction in HDL-C after atenolol therapy (P=0.0041, Table 2 , Figure 2C ). The mean change in HDL-C was -1.09 mg/dL, -1.90 mg/dL, and -4.04 mg/dL for the AA, AG, and GG genotypes, respectively (Figure 2D ).\n\nTop initial signals with low minor allele frequencies were further investigated to determine if single study participants with an extreme HDL-C response to atenolol were driving the observed signals. One white participant with an HDL-C change of -36.4 mg/dL was identified and the individual was removed in a sensitivity analysis (Table S2 ). All of the initial signals in whites remained except for LIPC rs9652472 (sensitivity P-value=0.3998). Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted in African Americans at rs12595985 in FTO (Table S3 ). The signal remained under both a dominant genetic model, collapsing the AA homozygote with the AC heterozygotes (sensitivity P-value=9.71x10-4) and an additive genetic model, after removing the single AA homozygote, (sensitivity P-value=3.18x10-3).\n\nThe putative functional implications of the lead SNPs from the initial signals in the 13 gene regions are shown in Table S4 . rs3736228, in LRP5 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5), is a non-synonymous SNP causing a conservative amino acid change of an alanine to valine at amino acid position 1330. Additionally, rs3736228 was predicted by FastSNP to affect splicing regulation. All of the other SNPs identified were located in intronic regions, or upstream or downstream of the nearest gene.\n\nIn order to examine the possible function of two the top SNPs, we measured gene expression at baseline (before atenolol treatment) of GALNT2 by rs2144300 genotype in 34 whites and of FTO by rs12595985 genotype in 35 African Americans. For GALNT2, study participants with one or two copies of the G allele had a 1.59 and 1.75 fold increase in relative expression at baseline, respectively, compared to AA homozygotes (P=0.0279, Figure 3 ). There was no difference in baseline expression between genotype groups for FTO (data not shown)."

    "content": "Results\n\nEvaluation of Performance of GMDR-GPU\n\nTo evaluate the speed of GMDR-GPU relative to the original Java implementation of GMDR, we conducted a series of performance tests for the Java version GMDR on a server equipped with an Intel® Xeon® X5680 CPU (3.33 GHz) and 96 GB of RAM. Six Tesla C2070 GPUs on the same server were used to test the speed of GMDR-GPU. Performance tests were run on a simulated dataset containing 5,000 subjects with a number of SNPs ranging from 103 to 106 per subject (Table 1). We performed an exhaustive two-dimensional search of each simulated sub-dataset by setting all other running parameters to default values. A CPU program of the same GMDR algorithm was also written in C++ to measure the speed-up obtained using the GPU rather than a CPU, which was run on the same CPU with the same amount of RAM using the same dataset.\n\nAs shown in Table 1, GMDR-GPU running on a 1 Tesla C2070 was about 550 times faster than the single-core C++ CPU version and about 3,500 times faster than the single-core Java CPU version. We also tested the performance of GMDR-GPU with multiple GPUs compared with a single GPU and found that GMDR-GPU running on six GPUs was about six times faster than that running on one GPU. In other words, GMDR-GPU achieves perfect scalability when running on multiple GPUs.\n\nApplication of GMDR-GPU to WTCCC T2D Phenotype\n\nTo provide an example of GWAS data analysis with the GMDR-GPU software, we applied it to the WTCCC dataset for the T2D phenotype. Prior to analysis, we performed data quality control, checking separately for cases and control subjects, and removed those SNPs with >10% missing data or minor allele frequency of <0.05. We further performed the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) test for all the SNPs included in the dataset for the control subjects and removed those SNPs with a P value <0.001. Following those filtering steps, 351,976 SNPs remained for each subject and were used in this study.\n\nFor the G×G analysis, we performed searches from two- to five-way interactions (Table 2). To avoid interactions that might be attributed to linkage disequilibrium effects, those SNP combinations containing any SNP pair whose physical distance is <1 Mb were ignored. Based on the values from 10-fold cross-validation for a given SNP combination, only those combinations whose cross-validation consistencies were >5/10 were used. An exhaustive two-dimensional search was run among those 351,976 SNPs that passed quality control testing for detecting two-way interactions.\n\nBecause it was impractical to run three- or higher-dimensional searches among these 351,976 SNPs, exhaustive three- to five-way searches were run only among the SNPs in the best combinations generated from the exhaustive two-dimensional search, a commonly used approach in G×G analysis for large dataset like GWAS. On the basis of the estimated time required for each run and the available computational capacity, we selected the top 1,000 SNP combinations from each training set. Because many SNPs in those best-SNP combination outputs through two-dimensional search overlapped, we finally identified 281 top and unique SNPs according to the two-dimensional search results and used them for exhaustive searches in three- to five-dimensional G×G analyses. Also, although we wished to perform as many permutations as possible for each SNP combination with our GMDR-GPU program, we finally decided to run 107 permutations for each SNP combination based on our current computational capacity and the time required to complete each run. Specifically, for our report on the WTCCC T2D data, we removed those interactions whose cross-validation consistencies were <7/10 or whose P value was >10−7. After these filtering steps, the remaining best SNP combinations were considered to be significant interactions and are reported here.\n\nDetermination of Core SNPs based on Two- to Five-way Interaction Analysis\n\nFollowing the two- to five-way interaction analyses for the T2D phenotype with GMDR-GPU, we generated an SNP-SNP interaction network with the goal of identifying core SNPs that were consistently detected by our G×G analyses at different dimensions (Figure 2). As shown in Table 3 and Figure 2, although a significant number of SNPs were identified, only 24 were considered to be “core” SNPs (i.e., identified repeatedly in multiple SNP combinations at different levels), which included 5 SNPs identified by two-way analysis; 1 by four-way analysis; 3 by two-way and five-way analyses; 1 by three-way, four-way, and five-way analyses; and the remaining 14 by five-way analysis. The best interaction models for these 24 core SNPs and their CVCs, testing accuracies, and P values based on 107 permutated samples are shown in Table 3.\n\nFurther mapping and bioinformatics analysis of the 24 core SNPs revealed that they are located in six genes (Table 4), with 2 SNPs in the l(3)mbt-like 3 gene (L3MBTL3) on chromosome 6; 8 in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) on chromosome 10; 1 in the tetraspanin 8 gene (TSPAN8) on chromosome 12; 6 in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) on chromosome 16; 2 in the CUGBP, Elav-like family member 4 gene (CELF4) on chromosome 16; and 5 in the runt-related transcription factor 1 gene (RUNX1) on chromosome 21. Of these six genes, TCF7L2, TSPAN8, and FTO have been previously reported to be associated with T2D, whereas other three genes (i.e., L3MBTL3, CELF4, and RUNX1) have not; thus, they likely represent new susceptibility genes for T2D in WTCCC GWAS dataset."

    "content": "Results\n\nCharacteristics of cohort\n\n10,000 participants were genotyped of which 6,870 participants were linked to Renown Hospital electronic health records with the covariates required to conduct this study: age at consent, gender, ethnicity and BMI. We removed 225 participants based on the exclusion criteria as stated in our methods. Our final cohort characteristics of the 6,645 individuals are described in Table 2, which illustrates the makeup of the cohort with respect to gender, age, ethnic origin, and standardized value of BMI after removal of outliers using our custom algorithm. For the extreme obesity (Class 2 and 3) case vs. control study, the normal (healthy) control range consisted of BMI values between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2, while the case obese values were any BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2. The number of participants in each range is displayed in Table 2.\n\nGWAS of BMI in the healthy Nevada cohort\n\nUsing quality-controlled BMI values, two separate GWASs were performed to find genotypic associations with BMI using PLINK. In the first association study, all individuals diagnosed with DM2 were excluded to focus on the association between the genotype and BMI under the additive model with adjustments for gender, age and the first four principal components (PC1-PC4). The second association analysis included all DM2-diagnosed individuals and added DM2 as a covariate to the model, again using the additive model with adjustments for gender, age, diabetes status, and PC1-PC4. Genomic inflation coefficients (lambda) were computed for the two separate cohorts: 1.06 for the association without DM as a covariate, and 1.06 for the association where DM is a covariate. Any SNP with association p-value of p < 1x10-5 was considered a statistically significant association, based on the standard of the NHGRI-EBI Catalog of published genome-wide association studies [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/methods/criteria], as well as obesity studies performed by Frayling et al.. Genetic variance in the BMI study with DM2 cases removed was 15.78%; genetic variance was 17.49% in the BMI study with DM2 cases included.\n\nThe first GWAS was performed on 5,994 total participants without DM2 and identified 20 SNPs across seven chromosomes at statistical significance defined by p<1x10-5 (Table 3). The majority of these mapped to the FTO gene on chromosome 16, while two SNPs mapped to TDH on chromosome 8 (Supplementary Figure S2). Of the 20 SNPs, 15 were shown to be associated with BMI in previous publications. A large majority of the SNPs (17/20) lie within noncoding regions of genes and are intronic in nature. It is interesting to note that our strongest associations lie within the FTO gene (p < 3.5x10-6). Results are presented in Table 3: BMI without DM2 lists the significant associations of our cohort that exclude all DM2 diagnoses. BMI with DM2 presents significant associations with BMI in the cohort that includes participants with a DM2 diagnosis. Effect sizes (and their standard deviations) are presented as change in BMI per each copy of the minor allele. Raw per-SNP p-values are presented.\n\nStatistical analysis with PLINK demonstrated that DM2 is a significant predictor of BMI, with the p-value of its coefficient consistently less than p < 2x10-16 in each per-SNP linear regression. The entire cohort includes 6,645 participants: of those, 651 have a diagnosis of DM2 in their twelve-year medical history. A GWAS applied to this larger cohort identified 27 statistically significant SNPs across seven chromosomes associated with BMI at p<1x10-5 (Figure 1). Furthermore, 77% of the SNPs in this second GWAS (21/27) were previously associated with BMI in previous research studies. With the addition of DM2 as a covariate, the GWAS identified several additional SNPs on chromosome 8, as well as SNPs on chromosomes 17 and 19. These additional SNPs were previously linked to BMI and obesity in other studies. Manhattan plots for the two BMI GWAS studies are presented in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2, with the linear associations results presented in Table 3.\n\nThe SNP on chromosome 17 is of particular interest, as it has the largest effect of any SNP identified in our study (β=0.90). It is also the rarest SNP tested in our cohort with minor allele frequency (MAF) 8.17%. The median MAF across the strongest associative SNPs in both studies is 40%, which demonstrates that most of the SNPs are common and thus result in relatively moderate individual effect sizes. Most of the SNPs lie within noncoding intronic regions; this is of interest as although noncoding SNPs do not alter the amino acid sequence of the translated protein, they may be linked to disease, as several previous studies show that polymorphisms within introns can affect intron splicing as well as transcriptional and translational efficiency.\n\nCase-control GWAS of extreme obesity in the healthy Nevada cohort\n\nA complementary GWAS was performed to identify genotype-phenotype links in extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 35) versus non-obese (BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2) in our cohort. This study incorporated 2996 participants (984 extreme obese cases, 2012 non-obese controls), and under the log-additive model with adjustments for gender, age and the first four principal components, identified 26 SNPs across six chromosomes that were associated with obesity at p < 1x10-5, with approximately 70% associated with obesity and BMI in prior studies (Figure 2). The percentage of phenotypic variance attributed to genetic variation based on all the SNPs was 15.7%. The genomic inflation coefficient (lambda) for the obesity cohort was computed as 1.05. We also include eight SNPs found slightly above the significance threshold in the FTO gene that are reported in several studies as obesity-related. In comparison to the two quantitative-trait BMI GWASs, this study identified several more associations around the NEGR1 gene on chromosome 1. We also identified SNPs in two genes, PFKFB3 and CABP5, which are associated with obesity in other studies. Note that all the mutations in the FTO gene increase the odds of obesity risk. Table 4 lists the strongest SNPs associated in our extreme obese vs. non-obese GWAS. Effect sizes and their standard deviations are presented as odds ratios. Raw p-values generated by the GWAS are also presented.\n\nFrom our three separate GWASs, we identified fifteen different chromosomal cytoband regions across ten chromosomes associated with at least one BMI or obesity-related trait. All but three of those cytoband regions contained a gene, while the remaining cytoband hits were in noncoding regions of the genome. Approximately 70% of the SNPs identified in this study were linked to BMI and obesity in prior studies (Tables 3 and 4), validating our methods. The functions of the genes which lie within the cytoband regions are outlined in Table 5.\n\nAnalysis of variance\n\nThe mean BMI values across genotypes presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 correlate with negative and positive effect sizes: SNPs showing a negative effect size have a decrease in mean BMI values across the genotypes from left to right (homozygous in major allele, heterozygous, homozygous in minor allele). Note that BMI levels increase with the increase of the number of minor alleles, which is typical of variants in FTO. All ANOVA F-test p-values of the significant SNPs identified in the two BMI studies are statistically significant at the alpha=0.05 level, even after a simple Bonferroni correction (.05/27 =0.0019, and .05/20=0.0025, respectively). Supplementary Table S3 presents the proportion of extremely obese cases across each genotype. A box and whisker figure of ANOVA results for one of the strongest associations (rs9939609) is shown in Supplementary Figure S3.\n\nPheWAS of BMI and obesity\n\nBeyond the GWASs, we present here two comprehensive PheWAS studies that follow each GWAS. The first examines pleiotropy, i.e., whether additional phenotypic associations exist between the statistically significant SNPs associated with BMI or obesity in our cohort. The second investigates which EHR phenotype groups are associated with BMI; more specifically, the analysis identifies whether the number of individuals in an EHR phenotype group is a predictor of BMI and/or extreme obesity.\n\nA PheWAS tested the 20 statistically significant SNPs identified in the first BMI GWAS (the sub-cohort with no DM2-diagnoses) for association with 562 EHR phenotypes and resulted in no statistically significant associations at the false discovery rate of 0.1 (data not shown). The top two associations showed that a locus on FUT9 (rs4839813) associated with obesity, and rs1620977 on NEGR1 associated with morbid obesity with raw p-values p=2.3x10-5 and 2.8x10-5, respectively. The second PheWAS identified 179 EHR (phenotypic) associations of BMI (DM2-diagnosed participants excluded) with p<2x10-2, that associates to an adjusted p-value of 0.1 (see Materials and Methods). Included in the strongest phenotypic associations are obesity, morbid obesity, and overweight (p<1x10-80), sleep apnea (p<1x10-45), hypertension (p<1x10-40), abnormal glucose (p<1x10-25), hyperlipidemia, asthma, GERD, osteoporosis, and others. (Data not shown).\n\nThe PheWAS of the second BMI GWAS (DM2-diagnosed individuals included) examined whether 633 EHR phenotype groups containing at least 20 participants are dependent on the genotypes of the 27 statistically significant SNPs associated with BMI in our cohort (Figure 3). Results of this PheWAS indicate that TDH and FAMA167-AS1 are strongly associated with DM2. Variants in the FTO gene associate with obesity and overweight phenotypes. An association with hypertension and essential hypertension and the locus rs12412241 on chromosome 10 was detected (p<1x10-4). Several strong associations with FTO loci and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were also found. Variants in the FTO gene also associated with obesity at the p=3x10-4 level, and with hypercholesterolemia with p=1x10-3 level. Significant associations (p<1.02x10-4, associated to an adjusted p-value of 0.1, see Materials and Methods) are included in Table 6 and illustrated in Figure 3, where the blue line represents the Bonferroni correction of p=3x10-6. The second PheWAS examined links between BMI and the 1,523 EHR phenotype groups containing at least 20 individuals in this cohort and showed that 301 such clinical phenotypes groups associated with significance p<1.96x10-2. (This significance level is associated to an adjusted p-value of 0.1, as described in the Materials and Methods) These are shown in Figure 4. Included in the highest associations are obesity, morbid obesity, and overweight (p<1x10-100), DM2 (p<1x10-87), hypertension ((p<1x10-82), sleep apnea (p<1x10-80), abnormal glucose (p<1x10-53), hyperlipidemia, asthma and other respiratory disorders, GERD, edema, liver disease, mood disorders, polycystic ovaries, and others. Significant associations are presented in Supplementary Table S4 and Figure 4. Only associations at p<1x10-15 are annotated in the image for ease of viewing. Note that a single-SNP Bonferroni correction results in a significance level of 3.3x10-5.\n\nWe performed the same two PheWASs on the case-control GWAS. The first PheWAS identified possible associations between 34 SNPs and 372 phenotype groups with at least 20 individuals (Figure 5). The significance level corresponding to an FDR of 0.1 was p=3.85x10-4, resulting in 50 significant associations. The Bonferroni correction p-value is 4x10-6 and shown in blue (see Materials and Methods). The strongest associations occurred between the NEGR1 and KLRB1 gene and obesity and morbid obesity and the NEGR1 gene and abnormal glucose. The NEGR1 gene, along with TDH and FAM167A-AS1, also associated with impaired fasting glucose and diabetes, respectively, at a slightly lower, yet still significant p-values. The locus rs2948300 on chromosome 8 associated with essential hypertension. The SNP rs1620977 on NEGR1 is linked with incidence of bronchitis. Additionally, several strong associations of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and digestive disorders with loci in CABP5 are shown. Results are pictured in Figure 5 and included in Table 7.\n\nThe second PheWAS in this case-control study identified possible links between 1,362 EHR phenotype groups with at least 20 individuals and the incidence of extreme obesity (Figure 6). The significant threshold of p=1.4x10-2 enabled an FDR of 0.1. At this significance level, 191 significant associations were identified, including obesity (p<1x10-134), hypertension (p<1x10-65), sleep apnea (p < 1x10-43), abnormal glucose (p<1x10-40), hyperlipidemia, asthma, and GERD. The high level of association with obesity validates our methods. These associations are shown in Figure 6, with phenotypes annotated above a significance level of 1x10-15 for ease of viewing. A line is drawn at the significance level 1x10-15 as guidance. Results are included in Supplementary Table S5. Note that a single-SNP Bonferroni correction results in a significance level of 3.7x10-5."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nTable 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the two study populations. Allele frequencies for the nine genotyped SNPs and test for HWE deviation are listed in online appendix Table 1. The MAFs for all nine SNPs were higher in Asian Indians (0.33–0.43) than in Malays (0.28–0.33) or Chinese (0.12–0.18). None of the SNPs showed significant deviation from HWE. Figure 1 illustrates the linkage disequilibrium between the nine FTO SNPs in the different ethnic populations. A high degree of linkage disequilibrium was observed between the SNPs, with similar patterns in all three ethnic groups in our population. In addition, the linkage disequilibrium structure of our population showed similarity to that of the European population (CEU population of HapMap [online appendix Fig. 1]).\n\nTable 2 shows associations between the nine SNPs with obesity, impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes. All nine FTO SNPs were associated with increased BMI with an effect size, per risk allele, of 0.42–0.68 kg/m2 (P < 0.0001) in NHS98 Chinese, 0.65–0.91 kg/m2 (P < 0.02) in NHS98 Malays, and 0.52–0.64 kg/m2 (P < 0.0001) in SiMES Malays. FTO variants were also associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the NHS98 Chinese (odds ratio 1.32–1.42; P ≤ 0.049), NHS98 Malays (1.52–1.63; P ≤ 0.028) and SiMES Malays (1.20–1.24; P ≤ 0.007). However, these associations were abolished after adjustment for BMI, except in the SiMES Malays (1.17–1.22; P ≤ 0.026). No statistically significant associations were observed in Asian Indians.\n\nWe next examined the association between FTO SNPs with obesity-related traits. Table 3 summarizes the association between rs9939609 and these traits. We chose rs9939609 as the representative SNP in our study because it was the index SNP in the original study and had one of the strongest associations with BMI. In our study, rs9939609 also showed highly significant association with waist circumference in both NHS98 Chinese (P < 0.0001) and NHS98 Malay (P = 0.001); waist circumference data were not available for SiMES Malays. Borderline association was also observed with LDL cholesterol and triglyceride, the latter only after adjustment for BMI, in NHS98 Chinese samples. Details of the associations for the other SNPs are listed in online appendix Table 2. Meta-analysis of the association between this SNP and BMI for all four populations in our study was also performed. No significant heterogeneity was observed between the four populations, and the pooled effect size was BMI 0.62 kg/m2 (95% CI 0.45–0.80; P = 2 × 10−12). Haplotype-based analyses recapitulated findings from individual SNP analyses; these results are shown in online appendix Table 3.\n\nWe also examined the interaction between rs9939609 and physical activity in relation to BMI (online appendix Fig. 2). Although it appeared that rs9939609 had a smaller effect on BMI in those who exercised regularly, the interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.248)."

    "content": "Results\n\nObesity GWAS SNPs/genes\n\nA total of 445 SNPs were identified to be associated with obesity, BMI, body weight, overweight or FBM at a significant threshold P < 5×10−8, and 389 genes were considered as obesity GWAS genes. Of these SNPs, 263 mapped to intronic regions, 63 mapped to intergenic regions, 64 located in gene upstream and 58 in gene downstream, 19 located in 3'UTR and 8 in 5'UTR, 15 missense variant, 10 nc transcript variants, and 3 synonymous variant. A total of 5,614 proxy SNPs were considered to be in strong LD with obesity GWAS lead SNPs by SNAP (r2 ≥ 0.80). The detailed information of obesity GWAS loci was showed in S1 Table.\n\nFunctional annotation of obesity GWAS lead SNPs and proxy SNPs\n\nOf the 6,059 SNPs, 36 SNPs returned error and 1,739 SNPs had score of ‘7’ that means no data available for these SNPs in RegulomeDB database, 4,284 SNPs returned with scores of 1–6, in which 680 SNPs (55 lead SNPs and 625 proxy SNPs) had score less than or equal to 3. The detailed regulatory functions of all GWAS SNPs and their proxy SNPs were given in S1 Table. Of particular note, four proxy SNPs which were in strong LD with obesity GWAS lead SNP rs977747 (located at 1p32 region) had scores of 1, were eQTLs for PDZK1IP1. Twenty-two proxy SNPs located at 1q21-q22 region had scores of 1, were eQTLs for CTSS. Four lead SNPs and multiple proxy SNPs located in 2p23.3 region were eQTLs for ADCY3. Additionally, some SNPs were located at the binding sites of obesity related transcription factors CEBPB, TCF7L2, STAT3, SPI1, GATA2, CREB1 and MEF2C (Table 1 and S2 Table). For 3DSNP, eleven GWAS lead SNPs had scores more than 100, and twelve GWAS lead SNPs were in the range of 60–100 (S1 and S3 Tables). GWAS lead SNP rs823114 had the highest 3DSNP score of 205.28 and a RegulomeDB score of 4, which located in 2kb upstream of the NUCKS1 gene. RegulomeDB suggested that rs823114 influence the binding of 59 different proteins (S3 Table). GWAS lead SNP rs329120 had the second highest 3DSNP score of 204.84 and a RegulomeDB score of 4, which located in the intronic region of the JADE2 gene and 500kb downstream of the LOC107986451 gene. RegulomeDB uncovered that rs329120 affect the binding of 34 different proteins (S3 Table). The functions of NUCKS1, JADE2 and LOC107986451 in obesity are unknown, and need to explore in the future.\n\nEffects of obesity GWAS lead SNPs and proxy SNPs on miRNA binding and protein phosphorylation\n\nUsing miRNASNP, nine obesity GWAS lead SNPs and 35 proxy SNPs might influence the recognition and targeting of miRNAs (S4 Table). Among these miRNAs, miR-326, let-7, miR-31, miR-342, miR-181a, miR-148, miR-196a and miR-548 have been reported to relate with adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. The target genes of these miRNAs were further identified using Target Scan Human 7.1 and literature mining through NCBI PubMed (Table 2).\n\nTen obesity GWAS lead SNPs and thirteen proxy SNPs may affect protein phosphorylation (Table 3). Among them, SNP rs6265 within BDNF influencing BDNF phosphorylation has been verified.\n\nProtein-protein interaction network\n\nFig 2 showed protein-protein interaction network of obesity GWAS genes coding proteins. Proteins with the strong connections were considered as being ‘Hub proteins’, such as CREB1, MC4R, PPARG, TMEM18, FTO, BCL2, TCF7L2, IRS1, SH2B1, KCNJ11, SEC16B, SLC30A8, BCDIN3D, BTRC, CDKAL1, FOXO3, GNPDA2, IGF2BP2, KCTD15, MTCH2 and RIT2 (S5 Table). These hub proteins were mainly involved in AMPK signaling pathway (CREB1, FOXO3, IRS1 and PPARG), Neurotrophin signaling pathway (BCL2, FOXO3, IRS1 and SH2B1), PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (BCL2, CREB1, FOXO3 and IRS1), Circadian rhythm (BTRC and CREB1), T2D (IRS1 and KCNJ11), and several cancer associated pathways. These hub proteins encoding genes were defined as “hub” genes.\n\nGO and pathway enrichment analyses of obesity GWAS genes\n\nGO and pathway enrichment analyses found that obesity GWAS genes significantly enriched in 104 GO functional categories with P-value < 0.05 (S6 Table) and 15 KEGG signaling pathways with FDR < 0.05 (S7 Table). Notably, of 104 GO functional categories, two GO terms “glucose homeostasis” and “response to glucose” were also enriched by T2D GWAS genes (such as TCF7L2 and FTO), indicating that obesity associated genes might confer T2D risk through its primary effect on adiposity."

    "content": "Results\n\n1. Demographic characteristics and their associations with thyroid cancer\n\nTable 1 provides the sociodemographic characteristics of 705 cases and 705 controls from the Korean National Cancer Center Screenee Cohort. Because of the 1:1 frequency-matched design, the age and sex distributions were equal for the cases and controls. In the total population, the average BMI was slightly higher in the cases than in the controls (p=0.01). In addition, the proportion of individuals with a first-degree family history of thyroid cancer was higher in the cases than in the controls (p < 0.001). However, differences between the cases and controls were not observed for marital status, educational level, occupation, monthly income, alcohol consumption, or smoking status. When classified by sex, BMI (p < 0.001) was higher in the male cases than in the male controls, whereas female cases were more likely to have a family history of thyroid cancer than female controls (p=0.01).\n\nIn the multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses, associations were observed between the demographic characteristics and thyroid cancer risk (Table 2). A family history of thyroid cancer was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer in the total population (adjusted OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.60 to 5.55). In contrast, the odds of thyroid cancer in sales and service participants were significantly lower than those in professions, office workers, and housewives (adjusted OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.94), whereas the odds in those with moderate income were higher than in those with low income (adjusted OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.23). An association was not observed among family history of cancer, marital status, educational level, monthly income, smoking status, and alcohol consumption in the total population. When classified by sex, the male population did not show any associations between occupation and thyroid cancer (Table 2).\n\nBMI was associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer in the overweight group (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.00) and the obese group (adjusted OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.14) compared with the risk in the normal group. When stratified by sex, BMI was also associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer in males in the overweight group (adjusted OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.42 to 4.97) and the obese group (adjusted OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.57 to 4.92) when the normal group was used as a reference, but the association in the females was not significantly different.\n\n2. Genetic characteristics and their associations with body mass index and thyroid cancer\n\nTable 3 presents the summary statistics of 27 SNPs included in the analysis. Additionally, there were differences in the distribution of genotypes of rs1861868 (p < 0.001) and rs8044769 (p=0.04) between total cases and controls, whereas unequal distribution was observed for rs8044769 (p=0.02) in females only (Table 4).\n\nTable 5 shows the association between single FTO variants and thyroid cancer risk in the codominant, dominant, and recessive models. Variant rs1861868 was found to be associated with a decreased risk of thyroid cancer, with adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of 0.73 (0.57–0.92) for A/G vs. G/G, 0.48 (0.25–0.95) for A/A vs. G/G, and 0.70 (0.56–0.89) for A/G-A/A vs. G/G. In contrast, variants rs8047395 and rs8044769 were found to be associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.39 (1.02–1.89) and 1.44 (1.05–1.97) in the recessive model.\n\nGenome association analysis revealed that none of the 27 SNPs included in the study were significantly associated with overweight and obesity (p > 0.1) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, Fig. 3 shows the LD block structure with the high correlation among 27 variants in the FTO gene. Then, Haploview identified seven tagging SNPs including rs1861868, rs8047395, rs56094641, rs1477196, rs9930506, rs11642841, and rs7195539. Compared to the haplotype GAAGACA, AAAGACA (adjusted OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.84), and GGAAACA (adjusted OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.72) were found to be associated with significantly lower odds of thyroid cancer in the total population and female subgroup, respectively (Table 6).\n\n3. Combined effect of body mass index and variants on thyroid cancer risk\n\nThe adjusted ORs and 95% CIs for the combined effect of BMI and SNP on thyroid cancer are presented in Tables 7–9. When using G/G carriers with normal BMI as the reference, overweight and obesity were significantly associated with thyroid cancer risks in all genotype groups of rs17817288, with adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of 1.77 (1.07–2.91), 1.66 (1.06–2.62), and 2.15 (1.18–3.95) for overweight participants carrying G/G, A/G, and A/A, respectively; and 2.68 (1.65–4.34), 1.67 (1.08–2.58), and 1.71 (1.01–2.90) for obese participants carrying A/A, G/A, and G/G, respectively, in the codominant model (Table 7). Neither overweight nor obesity was associated with thyroid cancer risks in all genotype groups of other variants.\n\nIn the dominant model, when using G/G-A/G carriers with normal BMI as the reference, overweight and obesity were significantly associated with thyroid cancer risks in A/G-A/A genotype carriers of rs9937053, rs12149832, and rs1861867 (Table 8). The adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for rs9937053 were 1.66 (1.04–2.67) and 1.71 (1.13–2.58) for overweight participants; and 2.20 (1.39–3.49) and 1.65 (1.12–2.45) for obese participants carrying G/G and A/G-A/A, respectively. The adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for rs12149832 were 1.81 (1.13–2.89) and 1.69 (1.11–2.57) for overweight participants and 2.30 (1.45–3.66) and 1.68 (1.13–2.49) for obese participants carrying G/G and A/G-A/A, respectively. The adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for rs1861867 were 1.40 (1.04–1.90) and 2.69 (1.06–6.83) for overweight participants and 1.56 (1.17–2.07) and 2.09 (1.02–4.27) for obese participants carrying G/G and A/G-A/A, respectively. When using A/A carriers with normal BMI as the reference, overweight and obesity were significantly associated with thyroid cancer risks in G/A-G/G genotype carriers of rs7195539, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.70 (1.12–2.57) and 1.64 (1.09–2.47) for overweight participants and 1.90 (1.27–2.86) and 1.75 (1.19–2.56) for obese participants carrying A/A and G/A-G/G, respectively.\n\nIn the recessive model, when using G/G carriers with normal BMI as the reference, overweight and obesity were significantly associated with thyroid cancer risks in A/A genotype carriers of rs17817288 and rs8044769 (Table 9). The adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for rs17817288 were 1.64 (1.19–2.25) and 2.11 (1.21–3.67) for overweight participants and 1.95 (1.43–2.67) and 1.66 (1.04–2.65) for obese participants carrying G/G-A/G and A/A, respectively. The adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for rs8044769 were 1.53 (1.12–2.10) and 2.55 (1.35–4.81) for overweight participants and 2.30 (1.45–3.66) and 1.68 (1.13–2.49) for obese participants carrying G/G-A/G and A/A, respectively."

    "content": "Results\n\nBaseline characteristics\n\nOf the 562 patients initially enrolled in the study, 459 had adequate data to be included in our analysis. Of the 103 patients who were not included in the analysis, only 5 were lost to follow-up. Twenty-seven of the patients not included met exclusion criteria that were missed on initial recruitment: 15 had metastatic cancer, 5 had ductal carcinoma in situ, 2 had lobular carcinoma in situ, 3 were pregnant, and 2 had a concurrent malignancy. The remaining patients had missing weight data either at baseline or on follow-up that precluded data analysis.\n\nTable 1 highlights the baseline patient characteristics and Table 2 the treatment characteristics of the 459 patients included in our analyses. The average patient age was 51.3 (s.d. 10.9) years old with the majority being Caucasian (74.5%) and the most common minority population being African American. The mean baseline BMI was 27.5 kg m–2, classified in the overweight category, and mean baseline weight 74.2 kg. About 70% of the patients received chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with the most common chemotherapy regimen being doxorubicin at 60 mg m–2 and cyclophosphamide at 600 mg m–2 i.v. every 2 weeks for four cycles followed by paclitaxel at 175 mg m–2 every 2 weeks for four cycles (ddACT), and 78% received endocrine therapy with tamoxifen being the most commonly used agent. Supplementary Table 1 shows the distribution of SNP alleles for the 4 FTO and 10 adiponectin pathway polymorphisms being evaluated in this study along with allele frequencies. In all, <1% of the SNP data are listed as undetermined, indicating that the analyser was unable to determine the specific allele; each of these samples was run twice for confirmation.\n\nWeight gain\n\nAs seen in Table 3, 33% of patients at 6 months and 56% at 18 months had a BMI increase of >0.5 kg m–2 from baseline. Average weight gain among these patients was 3.5 kg (s.d. 2.36 kg) at 6 month and 5.1 kg (s.d. 3.76 kg) at 18-month follow-up, with corresponding BMI increases from 1.3 kg m–2 (s.d. 0.84 kg m–2) to 1.9 kg m–2 (s.d. 1.42 kg m–2). To better evaluate clinically significant weight gain, we looked at >5% increase in baseline BMI and found that 13% of patients at 6 months and 36% at 18 months had gained this amount of weight. The maximum BMI increase was 9 kg m–2 at 18 months (38% increase in BMI), with maximum weight increase of 23.4 kg.\n\nUnivariate analysis of clinical variables\n\nSupplementary Table 2 shows the significant clinical variables in the univariate analysis at each time point of 6, 12, and 18 months from breast cancer diagnosis. Results for our analyses are expressed in effect sizes, with each value quantifying the relative change in BMI with variable of interest, for example −0.106 for BMI at diagnosis indicating that each additional increase in BMI by 1 kg m–2 at diagnosis is associated with 0.106 kg m–2 less increase in BMI by 6 months. Quartile analysis data is also included and expressed as ORs comparing likelihood of being in the upper quartile of weight gain compared with lower quartile with variable of interest. Results show that BMI at diagnosis and age were both negatively correlated with weight gain with younger and lower weight patients being at higher risk of weight gain. Weight gain was also associated with lower stage, ER/PR-positive markers, use of endocrine therapy, and absence of chemotherapy. Among the chemotherapy regimens, docetaxel 75 mg m–2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg m–2 (TC) i.v. every 3 weeks for four cycles was associated with less weight gain. There was some support for weight gain with premenopausal status at diagnosis (weight gain associated with premenopausal>postmenopausal>perimenopausal), menopausal change from premenopausal to peri/postmenopausal, absence of lymph node metastases, lower tumour grade, tamoxifen use, and white race though results were not significant across all time points. It should be noted that menopause classification was obtained from what was labelled in chart review and not based on serum markers. Menopausal status was more clearly specified in the diagnosis history and physical notes but at 1 year was only mentioned clearly in some patients' charts and in other cases postmenopausal status was inferred from descriptions of no menses for >1 year. Given the lack of thorough charting in follow-up notes, approximately 10% of 1-year data on menopausal status are missing, as can be seen in Table 1. No statistically significant differences in weight gain were seen at any time points for radiation therapy, family history, HER2 status, or menopausal status at 1 year.\n\nSingle SNP analysis\n\nSingle SNP analyses were conducted using a generalised linear model with effect sizes and quartile analyses with ORs, adjusting for clinical covariates. Results are as shown in Table 4. One FTO SNP (rs7206790) and six adiponectin pathway SNPs (rs1342387, rs822396, rs2232853, rs1501299, rs7539542, and rs10920531) were found through additive or dominance effects to be associated with weight gain for at least one time point, with the adiponectin rs822396 SNP through additive effects being the only one to show significance at two time points.\n\nMultivariate analysis\n\nWe used the Bayesian hierarchical generalised linear model for our multivariate analysis. This was performed using both epistatic and non-epistatic models as well as models including the FTO SNPs alone, the adiponectin pathway SNPs alone, and a combination of both sets of SNPs. The epistatic model using both sets of SNPs showed the best fit with smallest deviance and so was chosen to interpret our results as shown in Table 5. Also included are the results of multivariate quartile analysis. Paying particular attention to the SNPs that are significant at the 12-month or final 18-month points either individually or part of an interaction, rs822396, rs266729, rs1342387, and rs7539542 are notable. For the clinical variables, age and BMI were again significant across multiple time points (though age lost significance at 18 months) with younger and lower BMI women being at higher risk for weight gain, consistent with our univariate analysis. Oestrogen receptor status positivity, absence of chemotherapy, and lower stage were also associated with increased weight gain, although stage was only significant at the 6-month time point.\n\nPredictive models\n\nWe created several clinical, genetic, and combination models using the above data to predict the post-diagnosis weight gain in our patients. As described in the Materials and Methods section, discriminatory power of our predictive models was assessed by performing ROC analysis (Figure 1). The ROC curves show the estimated true-positive and the false-positive rates for different classification thresholds between 0 and 1. The AUC represents the probability that given two random individuals, one who will develop the disease and the other who will not, the predictive model will assign the former as a positive test and the latter as a negative test. A perfect predictive model would have an AUC of 1. It has been suggested that an AUC>0.5 has some discriminatory ability and for screening high-risk individuals an AUC>0.75 should be used.\n\nA traditional clinical model was generated with the significant variables on univariate analysis and yielded AUCs of 0.51, 0.50, and 0.47 for 6, 12, and 18-month weight gains, respectively. For the genetic SNP models, analyses were conducted on both main effect and epistatic models for FTO SNPs alone, adiponectin pathway SNPs alone, and the combination of both at each time point. We performed the analyses first by focusing on only the significant SNPs seen in the above multivariate analysis and then by including all the SNPs. We found that an epistatic model incorporating all 14 SNPs had highest AUCs with values of 0.84, 0.81, and 0.79 for 6, 12, and 18-month weight gains, respectively. In comparison, the epistatic model incorporating only significant SNPs had AUCs of 0.57, 0.59, and 0.24 and the main effects model with all 14 SNPs had AUCs of 0.6, 0.6, and 0.59. Incorporating both FTO and adiponectin pathway SNPs yielded higher AUC values than including only one of these groups. Using our most predictive model of all 14 SNPs and their epistatic interactions, we analysed several combinations with clinical variables and found that incorporating all significant clinical variables decreased the AUCs to values of 0.55, 0.48, and 0.52. In contrast, addition of only the baseline age and BMI yielded our most powerful model, as illustrated in Figure 1, with AUC values of 0.90, 0.88, and 0.85, for 6, 12, and 18-month weight gains, respectively."

    "content": "Results\n\nFifteen GWAS SNPs frequency profile in obesity-risk/healthy dichotomy\n\nWe present fifteen target GWAS SNPs-specific frequency profiles in Fig. 2. According to allele frequencies distribution and previous haplotype research, we segregate the locus into 4 haploblocks (Fig. 2). The haploblocks partition was majorly ‘supervised’ by African populations group due to the allele frequency profiles (Fig. 2) and, to a minor extent, other (non-European) populations. Note that positions 3 (rs1421085), 4 (rs1558902), 6 (rs62033400), 14 (rs17817964), 15 (rs12149832) are highly monomorphic in the ancestral population (AFR), implying that they can shift the original (ancestral) obesity status during the course of evolution. In particular, no drastic adipocyte specific pathophysiology of obesity due to the rs1421085 alternative allele should be observed in African population. Another clear observation from Fig. 2 is that the European population shares the smallest ratio of low-risk alleles across all polymorphisms considered. Notably, all 15 SNPs are linked in EAS populations by r2 statistic disequilibrium rate in EAS populations including the first position, thus representing a single haploblock therein.\n\n1000 Genomes assessment on the 15-fold FTO locus\n\nTo control for the haplotype consistency, we performed pairwise comparison of haplotype distributions in populations using a conventional F statistic (; see methods) analogous to Fst ratio, with a subsequent Multi Dimensional Scaling plot creation (XLStat, Inc.; xlstat.com) presented in Fig. 3. We may see that the populations unambiguously cluster into corresponding continental groups, underscoring the consistency of the haplotype clustering.\n\nConverging to 10 letters haplotype\n\nBased on the Arlequin Amova variance analysis (Table 2), we excluded positions 2, 5, 7–9 due to their small variations (< 7.1%; Va < 0.011) among groups (Table 2, bold typed), also underlined on haplotype profiles of AFR (Fig. 3) and other populations (not shown). The aim of conversion was to reduce the haplotype variability to core haplotypes suitable to infer the transparent, essential features of population specific haplotype distribution by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and phylogeny tree plotting.\n\nWe thus removed the positions with minimal (4–8%) variation among groups of populations (SAS, EAS, AFR, EUR), which reduced the representation of abundant haploblocks 2 and 3 (Fig. 2) without losing the population specificity of the haplotypes. After the compressing the 15-letter haplotypes to 10-fold ones we observed 6 core alleles, presented in Table 3.\n\nFTO intron 1 haplotype evolution\n\nWe reconstructed the phylogeny of haplotypes from Table 3 using the DNAML routine from the phylip package (Fig. 4). We also excluded the distant first SNP impact in frequencies assessment for transparency. From the locus phylogeny it follows that: a) the major haplotype (population-wide) was present in the ancestral (African) population and comprised low-risk SNP alleles (partially except for the first position) (Fig. 4;’ major allele’); and b) The second ancestor allele maintains haploblock 3 (Fig. 2) inversed (Fig. 4; ‘minor1 allele’), which contains 4 obesity risk substitutions. Further evolution resulted in fixing of European/South Asian specific alleles (Fig. 4, ‘minor2 allele’) consisting totally of risk-associated SNPs variants.\n\nNotably, the major low-risk allele frequency is elevated in EAS/SAS population relative to AFR state and is decreased in EUR populations (Fig. 3; ‘major allele’).\n\nPCA analysis of haplotype distribution\n\nBased on Table 3, we performed the PCA analysis, presented in Fig. 5, which indicated a distinct distribution of population–specific haplotypes. In particular, population wise Europeans possess the highest ratio of risk-associated alleles (0.3; Fig. 5; Table 3), while EAS populations have the highest low-risk allele ratio (0.64; Table 3). The intermediate allele ATTAATAACG located opposite the EAS specific allele implies that the first position low-risk allele is interlinked (by r2 disequilibrium rate) with the rest of SNPs specifically in EAS populations, contrary to others (Fig. 2). Another intermediate allele located opposite to African-specific haplotypes implies that no polymorphism is observed in African populations for 2, 3, 6, 9, 10 positions according to the SNP frequency profiles (Fig. 2).\n\nSix major 15-fold haplotypes\n\nSix target full-sized 15-fold haplotypes corresponding to ones in Table 3 are presented in Table 4 and are plotted in Fig. 6. Two haplotypes (Table 4; N1, 2) correspond to healthy state haplotype except for the first position, which is highly linked in EAS populations only. The highest-risk haplotype (Table 4; N3) is essentially presented in EUR and SAS populations."

    "content": "Results\n\nCharacteristic of the study group\n\nA total of 5559 unrelated Polish adult subjects were enrolled to the study group. According to the GWAS exclusion criteria described above we excluded 141 samples due to bad quality of the genotyping. After exclusion, there were 2758 women and 2660 men (N = 5418). Case (obesity and/or overweight individuals) and control (normal weight individuals) groups were established from the study group according to the BMI (kg/m2). The sample size for obese subjects (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) was 797 (male:female ratio 424:373, age 50.16 ± 13.55 years, BMI 33.15 ± 3.33 kg/m2), whereas for normal weight controls (BMI 18.5–24.99 kg/m2) was 2624 (male:female ratio 1127:1497, age 38.74 ± 14.13 years, BMI 22.27 ± 1.71 kg/m2). The underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) and overweight (BMI 25–29.99 kg/m2) groups consisting of 192 (male:female ratio 155:37, mean age 32.30 ± 12.31 years, BMI 17.49 ± 0.92 kg/m2) and 1805 individuals (male:female ratio 1072:733, with mean age 45.48 ± 14.25 years and BMI 27.19 ± 1.39 kg/m2), respectively, were also included to the analysis (Table 1).\n\nIn our study we successfully genotyped SNPs spanning the 2 Mb region, encompassing the RPGRIP1L, FTO, IRX3, IRX5, IRX6 genes. This region was selected according to the Hunt et al. to encompass a TAD defined in embryonic stem cells. We found 353 SNPs in the tested area. We estimated the minor allele frequency (MAF) of all mentioned SNPs and realized that 89 of them had a MAF under 0.01 (S1 Table) so we excluded them from the further analysis. In the case and control groups (S2 Table), two SNPs, rs4784382 and rs1211435, showed evidence for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE; p<1E-04) and they were also excluded. Total genotyping rate in all individuals was 0.999 for all tested SNPs.\n\nIn summary, we conducted association analyses for 262 SNPs with an estimated MAFs > 1% in 5418 unrelated Polish adults, divided into four groups as described above and presented in Table 1. The ratio of women to men in our study group was 1.037 (50.9%: 49.1%).\n\nLinkage disequilibrium and haplotypes association analysis\n\nWe investigated the role of haplotypes formed by tested SNPs (n = 262) in the risk for obesity in our study group. Haplotyping was performed with Haploview. As shown in Fig 2, LD analysis revealed 61 blocks in the tested region of chromosome 16, with 24 SNPs located within the same block 8 of approximately 42 kb, in almost complete LD (|D’|>0.98). This previously identified region in the first intron of the FTO contains rs76804286, localized next to the rs9939609, which is in complete dependence with all the SNPs in this block and with six SNPs from the block 3, and also with SNPs from the blocks 4, 5, 6 and 7. Haplotypes are depicted at S1 Fig. The strongest obesity associating haplotype (χ2 = 11.474, p = 0.0007) was in block 8 and occurred at a frequency of 0.46 in the case group and 0.41 in controls (S3 Table). Two other haplotypes were also associated with higher BMI: first in block 30 which is localized 200 kb upstream IRX3 and second in 57 localized 8 kb upstream IRX6, (p = 0.0079 and 0.0097, respectively).\n\nCase-control association studies\n\nUsing 262 selected SNPs, we performed tests of independence between BMI and alleles of each SNP using differently coded control and case phenotype group: normal vs. overweight, normal vs. obesity, normal vs. overweight and obesity. As the underweight group was represented by only 192 individuals we excluded it from association analysis.\n\nWe found that the association of alleles of tested SNPs with BMI was different in group of women and men (S4–S6 Tables). The most interesting finding from our analysis is that the FTO intronic region (47 kb block 8) was strongly associated with overweight only in males without impact of SNPs from this block on overweight in a group of females. Surprisingly, analysis of obesity phenotype in sex stratified manner did not revealed sex differences in this region (S2 and S3 Figs, respectively). A case-control analysis for obese female and male groups without sex stratification was performed and results are presented in supplementary materials (S7 Table and S4 Fig).\n\nWe have also performed analyses on different age groups in female and male. Six different age classes were set up in every 10 years interval (20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79). Using CMH we tested the association of every SNP with overweight and/or obesity while assuming age class stratification. The observed effect of the SNPs impact on overweight and obesity was similar as described above but the estimated p values were lower while taking into account age stratification (S8 and S9 Tables). Differences in the distribution of estimated p values of the Chi square test between sexes in the normal weight versus obesity and normal weight and overweight association analysis with age stratification are depicted at Figs 3 and 4, respectively. This entirely confirmed the statistically significant association of block 8 SNPs with overweight group of male found in our analyses.\n\nThe FTO rs1558902 had the highest observed chi-square statistic (χ2 = 14.28, p = 0.0001572, OR = 1.265, SE = 0.06227, 95% CI = 1.12–1.43) in group of overweight men versus normal weight, whereas rs4270172, located 200 kb upstream IRX3, had the highest observed chi-square statistic (χ2 = 7.241, p = 0.007125, OR = 0.8063, SE = 0.08054, 95% CI = 0.6885–0.9442) in overweight females. When we analyzed the normal weight group versus group of obese women and obese men, the most statistically significant variants were located in FTO: rs1558902χ2 = 11.38, p = 0.000741, OR = 1.349, 95% CI = 1.133–1.605 and χ2 = 10.55, p = 0.001162, OR = 1.317, 95% CI = 1.115–1.556, respectively)) and rs12149832 (χ2 = 10.84, p = 0.000994, OR = 1.338, 95% CI 1.125–1.592 and χ2 = 10.09, p = 0.001493, OR = 1.309, 95% CI = 1.108–1.546, respectively).\n\nWe found additional association regions, in normal weight versus obesity analysis, which were located upstream IRX3 (block 29 and 30, highest observed p value for rs1420285: χ2 = 10.84, p = 0.000994, OR = 1.338, 95% CI = 1.125–1.592) and downstream IRX6 (blocks 53 and 54 with highest observed p value for rs2171262: χ2 = 10.87, p = 0.000975, OR = 1.431, 95% CI = 1.155–1.772) in females only (Fig 3). When we pulled together overweight and obesity groups we realized that in females group there are only 8 statistically significant SNPs compared with 27 in males (S6 Table).\n\nWe then searched for differences in the distributions of allele/genotype frequencies in case and control groups under additive, dominant, and recessive inheritance models. Stratification by BMI and sex revealed the influence of sex on the effect of tested SNPs on increased BMI in a genetic model-dependent manner (S10–S12 Tables). The strongest effect on obesity occurred again with FTO variants: rs1558902 and rs1421085 in females using a dominant model (p = 0.000463 and p = 0.0004744 respectively). In a group of males, two different FTO loci, rs12149832 and rs9930506, showed the strongest association with obesity under the recessive model (p = 0.003137 and 0.003741, respectively). Under the recessive inheritance model we also observed the strongest statistically significant association with BMI in range 25–29.99 kg/m2 for three loci in males and only one in females: rs4435250 (non-coding sequence located 100 kb downstream IRX5), rs9930506, rs12149832 (both FTO SNPs) and rs12444481 (non-coding sequence located 200 kb downstream IRX5), respectively.\n\nPrevious studies suggested that genetic association to obesity at the FTO locus may be age dependent. According to this, we examined the role of age in our age-diverse group (range from 20 to 77). Linear regression using BMI as a continuous trait (including underweight subjects) with sex and age as a covariates revealed differential contributions of SNPs to increased BMI. Obtained results are presented in Fig 5 and S13 Table. Age had bigger influence on BMI in group of women than in males. There were SNPs with positive and negative regression coefficient. The highest positive regression coefficient was observed only for three FTO variants: rs1558902, rs1421085 and rs9939609. The minor alleles of these SNPs were significantly more frequent in the obese group than in the normal-weight control group (0.5075 vs. 0.4509, 0.5069 vs. 0.4516 and 0.4812 vs. 0.4354, respectively) and carriers of the mentioned MAF had higher BMI than homozygous for the wild-type alleles (Beta = 0.3492, 95% CI = 0.1892–0.5093, p = 1.93E-05; Beta = 0.345, 95% CI = 0.185–0.5051, p = 2.42E-05; Beta = 0.3124, 95% CI = 0.1523–0.4725, p = 0.0001329, respectively)."

    "content": "Results\n\nDemographics of Study Subjects\n\nThe overall clinical and laboratory characteristics of the 741 MAFLD patients and the 825 controls are listed in Table 1. Age or gender differences between MAFLD and control groups were neglectable. BMI, waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, FPG, TG, ALT, GGT and the prevalence of diabetes were found to be higher in the MAFLD group than the control group (P <0.05). HDL-C was lower in the MAFLD group than in the control group (P <0.05). \n\nSingle SNP Site Associations\n\nThe detailed information of six SNPs are listed in Table 2. For all six SNPs, there was no significant deviation from HWE in either the case or control groups (P >0.05). The allele frequencies of rs1421085, rs8050136, rs3751812 and rs9939609 were significantly different between MAFLD and controls (Pcorr <0.05). The C allele frequency of rs1421085 was remarkably higher in MAFLD patients (OR=1.353; 95% CI=1.095–1.671; P =0.005; Pcorr =0.030). The occurrence of A allele of rs8050136 was significantly increased in MAFLD group (OR=1.371; 95% CI=1.109–1.695; P =0.004; Pcorr =0.024). In rs3751812, the T allele frequency was remarkably higher in MAFLD (OR=1.369; 95% CI=1.108–1.691; P =0.004; Pcorr =0.024). And the A allele frequency of rs9939609 was also significantly increased in MAFLD (OR=1.369; 95% CI=1.108–1.691; P =0.004; Pcorr =0.024). \n\nFive different genetic models (codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant and log-additive) were tested to assess the association of genotype frequencies with MAFLD. As shown in Figure 1, the dominant model of rs8050136, rs3751812 and rs9939609 was statistically different after Bonferroni correction, as well as the log-additive model of rs1421085, rs8050136, rs3751812 and rs9939609 (Pcorr <0.05). As described in Table 3, a significantly different result was observed in log-additive model of rs1421085 (OR=1.369; 95% CI=1.108–1.691; P =0.004; Pcorr =0.024). For rs8050136, A-allele carriers were found to have significantly increased risk of MAFLD with an OR of 1.393 (Pcorr =0.030, 95% CI =1.103–1.759), compared to the carriers of homozygous CC genotype. For rs3751812, T-allele carriers were observed to strikingly add MAFLD risk with an OR of 1.392 (Pcorr =0.030, 95% CI = 1.103–1.756). For rs9939609, individuals with T-allele were also detected to be more susceptible to MAFLD, compared to the individuals of homozygous TT genotype with an OR of 1.392 (Pcorr =0.030, 95% CI = 1.103–1.756). Given the effect sizes of 0.1, we obtained the power above 95% at p = 0.05. The SNP genetic models without significant differences can be found in Supplementary Table 1. \n\nHaplotype Analysis\n\nThe r2 were calculated for all random combinations of SNPs. We identified rs1421085-rs8050136-rs3751812-rs9939609 as a strong LD block within FTO gene with Haploview analysis (Figure 2). Haplotypes in our study with an estimated frequency below 3% in both cases and controls were excluded from further analysis. We found that the haplotype of TCGT (rs1421085-rs8050136-rs3751812-rs9939609) can appreciably lower the risk of MAFLD (P =0.002; OR = 0.728; 95% CI =0.590–0.898) and that individuals with CATA haplotype had an elevated MAFLD risk (P =0.005; OR =1.348; 95% CI 1.089–1.667) (Table 4)."

    "content": "Results\n\nAllelic and genotypic association\n\nThe results of logistic regression analyses suggested 14 of the 76 SNPs to be significantly associated with T2DM at P ≤ 0.05 and seven of those remained highly significant even after correction for multiple testing (Table 1) by either Bonferroni single-step adjusted P values and/or Benjamini & Hochberg step-up FDR (False Discovery Rate) control. Bonferroni adjustment is one of the most commonly used approaches for multiple comparisons. Six of these seven SNPs involve in insulin signaling, glucose homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism and folliculogenesis. The gene FEM1B is explored for the first time in T2DM and was found to be risk conferring, while it was earlier found to be associated with insulin related traits in PCOS with a protective role. Of the seven highly significant variants, five—rs2241766-G (p_corrected = 2.86 × 10−34) of ADIPOQ, rs6494730-T (p_corrected = 6.56 × 10−13) of FEM1B, rs2059806-T (p_ corrected = 0.003) of INSR, rs9939609-A (p_ corrected = 0.003) and rs9940128-A (p_ corrected = 0.01) of FTO genes were risk and rs1799817-A (p_corrected = 1.61 × 10−06) of INSR and rs11745088-C (p_corrected = 0.001) of FST genes protective in nature. It may be pertinent to note that two of the above seven highly significant SNPs (rs6494730-T and rs11745088-C) belong to reproductive pathway. Interestingly, all the remaining 7 relatively less significant SNPs lost significance after adjusting for covariates—age, sex, migration, family history, physical activity, body mass index and waist hip ratio-, suggesting the confounding nature of the effect of these covariates, particularly the BMI. On the other hand, rs7248104-A of INSR and rs2161829-A of INSIG2 genes that were not significantly associated turned out to be marginally significant (P ≤ 0.05) after adjusting for covariates. The results of genotype–phenotype association (Table 2) yielded qualitatively similar results when compared to the allelic association, excepting rs2241766-G, which is an exonic variant and rs6494730-T, an UTR variant, exhibited an increased four-fold and two-fold risk when compared to the degree of their allelic association under the over-dominant model. Although the genotypic association for SNPs was tested under five different models—co-dominant, dominant, over-dominant, recessive and log-additive, the best model with lowest AIC value was considered for the respective SNPs. With exception to one, while all the SNPs showed very good fit under the log additive model, for seven of those it was also the best fitted model for genotypic effects on T2DM. Further, after adjusting for covariates, the significance of most of the SNPs was reduced as observed in the allelic association.\n\nIn an effort to check the internal consistency of our results and to validate these results in the same population we have split our sample into 30%, 50% and 70% random subsets of cases and controls and repeated the logistic regression analysis of the allelic data. The results suggested similar association pattern with T2DM (Additional file 4: Table S4) in 11 of the 14 significant SNPs in two of the 3 subsets (50% & 70%) as compared to the total sample, thus showing internal consistency and validation of the results. It is not surprising that the 3 SNPs which failed to replicate in the subsets were the ones with only marginally significant association in the total sample.\n\nSNP–SNP interactions\n\nThe logistic regression analysis of the pair wise SNP–SNP interactions through parametric approach yielded a total of 11 highly significant pairs of SNP–SNP interactions (Table 3). Among the 11 pairs of SNP interactions, 4 pairs were significantly associated with risk towards T2DM. Of these, the most significant pair-wise interaction conferring risk towards T2DM was rs1799817-rs2059806 of INSR with an odds ratio of 2.42 and P value of 1.91 × 10−06. Some of the SNPs which were not significant at the allelic and genotypic associations were found to be significantly associated with T2DM in conjunction with another SNP. It is pertinent to note that out of the total 10 obesity related SNPs from FTO, ADIPOQ and LEPR genes considered in this study, seven were involved in pair-wise interactions and associated with either risk or protective nature towards manifestation of T2DM. The GMDR results for multiple SNP interactions are presented in Table 4. The interaction models above the threshold of testing balance accuracy of 0.55 and with highly significant test P values and cross validation consistency were considered to be significant and was observed only at the four loci model involving rs2241766(ADIPOQ), rs2059806 (INSR), rs6494730 (FEM1B) and rs1799817(INSR) SNPs.\n\nLinkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotypes\n\nThe pair-wise LD analysis of all the SNPs showed only five SNP pairs with r2 > 0.8 and 18 SNP pairs with r2 between 0.2 and 0.5. In general, a disrupted pattern of LD was observed with 13 tagged SNPs with r2 > 0.8. Using Gabriel haplotype block definition criteria, only 7 haplotype blocks could be discerned (Table 5) of which only two were significantly associated with T2DM, one risk conferring after adjusting for covariates (INSR: OR = 1.300, P = 0.015) and another protective (FTO: OR = 0.376, P = 0.001).\n\nCumulative risk score analysis\n\nBased on the 14 significant SNPs, the combined genetic risk score was calculated for each subject by computing the weighted mean proportion of the associated SNPs by considering 2 for two risk alleles, 1 for single risk allele and 0 when there is no risk allele with weights as relative log odds ratios with respect to different SNPs. The cumulative risk score for each individual was obtained by multiplying the combined genetic risk score with the number of significant SNPs. The individuals with risk scores ranging from 8.0 to 21.9 were grouped into 10 risk categories and the number of cases and controls in each category are presented in Table 6, which suggests a translucent trend of increased proportion of cases when compared to the controls with increasing risk score/category, particularly from the 6th. This has also reflected in the increasing trend of odds ratios computed by using risk category 1 as the reference. The odds ratios for the risk categories 4–10 were found to be significantly associated with T2DM. The ROC curve was constructed and the area under curve (AUC) was observed to be highly significant [0.787 (95% CI 0.759–0.815, P ≤ 0.0001)] (Fig. 1), which may suggest the predictive utility of these risk variants for T2DM in this population. Further, the ROC curve based on the risk score of seven highly significant SNPs (after correction for multiple testing) and/or for only five of the 7 with risk yielded very similar AUC and the predictive value as to that of 14 SNPs.\n\nGenetic association patterns in the male and female cohorts\n\nThe heterogeneity in biology, environment and lifestyle pattern determine the distinction in the genetic predisposition and development of any complex disease among males and females. Likewise, the disparities among males and females in sex hormones have an important effect on T2DM as observed in case of androgens, since hyperandrogenism in females and hypogonadism in males are prominent risk factors for T2DM. Further, given the shared pathophysiology of T2DM and PCOS and since majority of PCOS women manifest T2DM at later stage and even a notable fraction of younger T2DM female show signs of PCOS one would surmise if the genetic variants associated with reproductive phenotype of PCOS would also be associated with T2DM patients. The results of association analyses in gender specific cohorts (Table 7) suggested significant association of 14 and 13 SNPs, respectively in males and females. Further, while eight of the 14 SNPs were significant even after correction for multiple testing in males only two SNPs were significant in the female subset, which could be partly due to relatively small sample size for females. Further, seven SNPs of the male subset and nine SNPs of the female subset were found to be associated with risk towards T2DM. While 11 of the 14 significant SNPs from the male subset are common with that of the pooled set (Males + females), only seven of the 13 SNPs from the female subset were common, reflecting that 78% of the pooled set was represented by males and hence the pattern in males is more complementary to the pooled set. Interestingly, the SNPs of PRKAG3, ESR2 and FBN3 genes not associated in the pooled set, were observed to be significantly associated in the male and/or female subsets; while the SNP of PRKAG3 was protective in females, the variants of reproductive pathway genes—FBN3 showed protective nature in males and risk in females and ESR2 was protective in both the sub sets."

    "content": "Results\n\nAssessment of pleiotropic enrichment\n\nAs an intuitive illustration, we present the data as conditional Q-Q plots (Fig. 1) to graphically assess the pleiotropic enrichment of SNPs of the principal phenotype successively conditioning on various strengths of associations with the conditional phenotype. Under the global null hypothesis, the theoretical distribution of p-values is expected to lie approximately on the diagonal line of the Q-Q plots. Enrichment of genetic associations is indicated as a leftward deflection from the null line as the principal phenotype is successively conditioned on increasing strength of associations with conditional phenotype. The degree of deflection between curves provides important information about the degree of pleiotropy between the two phenotypes. Larger deflection is considered as a greater enrichment of pleiotropic genes between the two phenotypes.\n\nThe conditional Q-Q plot for T2D conditional on CARD (A in Fig. 1) shows some enrichment across varying significance thresholds for CARD. The presence of leftward shift when restricting the analysis to include the SNPs that have more significant associations with T2D indicates an increase in the number of true associations for a given CARD p-value. Similar enrichment is observed for CARD given T2D (B in Fig. 1), as there appears to be a similar departure pattern between the different curves. These earlier deflections from the null line indicate a great proportion of true associations for any given T2D nominal p-value.\n\nOn the other hand, as negative controls, the conditional Q-Qplots for T2D given nominal p-values of association with ADHD (A in Fig. S1), CARD given nominal p-values of association with ADHD (C in Fig. S1), T2D given nominal p-values of association with MDD (A in Fig. S2), and CARD given nominal p-values of association with MDD (C in Fig. S2) all show no enrichment, and vice versa.\n\nT2D loci identified with cFDR\n\nConditional on their association with CARD, we identified 33 significant SNPs (cFDR <0.05) for T2D variation (A in Fig. 2 and Table 1), which were mapped to 13 different chromosomes (1,3, 5–12,15–17) and annotated to 37 genes. In the original meta-analysis for T2D GWAS, 16 SNPs had p-values smaller than 1 × 10−5 while 6 of them reached the standard genome-wide significance of 5 × 10−8. We confirmed 11 SNPs that were reported in the original T2D GWAS analysis and previous T2D related GWASs. Another 7 SNPs that were reported to be associated with T2D-related traits were also confirmed in our analysis. The remaining 15 SNPs were not previously reported in the original T2D GWAS and the previous studies did not show their significance for T2D, while 2 SNPs of them showed high LD (r2 > 0.6) with the T2D-associated SNPs reported previously. For the 37 genes these 33 SNPs annotated to, 16 of them were newly detected compared to the original T2D and previous T2D-related studies. The details are provided in Table S1. Of the detected loci for T2D, most of the genes were enriched in T2D-related terms “positive regulation of fatty acid oxidation”, and “white fat cell differentiation”. GO term enrichment analysis results are detailed in Table 2.\n\nCARD gene loci identified with cFDR\n\nConditional on their association with T2D, we identified 34 significant SNPs (cFDR <0.05) for CARD variation (B in Fig. 2 and Table 3), which were located on 17 chromosomes (1–10,12–18) and annotated to 43 genes. In the original meta-analysis for CARD GWAS, 18 SNPs had p-values smaller than 1 × 10−5 while 5 of them reached the standard genome-wide significance of 5 × 10−8. We confirmed 13 SNPs that were reported in the original CARD GWAS analysis and previous CARD related GWASs. Another 5 SNPs that were reported to be associated with CARD-related traits were also confirmed in our analysis. The other 16 SNPs were not previously reported in the original CARD GWAS and the previous studies did not show their significance for CARD, and none of the novel SNPs showed high LD (r2 > 0.6) with the CARD-associated SNPs reported previously. For the 43 genes these 34 SNPs annotated to, there were 24 of them were newly detected compared to the original CARD and previous CARD-related studies. The details are provided in Table S2. Of the detected loci for CARD, some of the genes were enriched in CARD-related terms “protein domain specific binding” and “lipoprotein lipase activity”. GO term enrichment analysis are detailed in Table 2.\n\nPleiotropic gene loci for both T2D and CARD\n\nThe conjunction FDR analysis detected 9 independent pleiotropic loci that were significantly (conjunction FDR < 0.05) associated with both traits (C in Fig. 2 and Table 4). Of the 9 identified pleiotropic variants, three SNPs rs10965212 (CDKN2B-AS1), rs4510208 (ICA1L) and rs10744777 (ALDH2) were reported to be significant for CARD in the original CARD GWAS or previous CARD GWAS. The other two SNPs (rs11979110 and rs3843467) were previously reported to be associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides. The remaining four SNPs were not previously reported in the original T2D and CARD related GWASs and in the previous studies they were not significant for either T2D or CARD. For the 12 genes those pleiotropic SNPs annotated to, we found six of them (CDKN2B-AS1, ICA1L, ALDH, RAI1, C5orf67 and KLF14) were reported by T2D or CARD related GWAS. The other six genes were not identified by any T2D or CAD related GWAS. For the SNPs that were annotated to these 6 genes, one SNP was located in the intronic regions of gene CPPED1, the rest of the SNPs were all located in intergenic regions of the genes. Detailed information were shown in Table 2. Of the detected 9 pleiotropic loci, most of the genes were enriched in T2D and CARD related terms “protein domain specific binding” and “negative regulation of multicellular organism growth”. Detailed information of GO term analysis is given in Table 2.\n\nProtein-protein interaction network\n\nThe 37 identified T2D-associated genes were retrieved from the STRING database. Only 18 genes, including 3 novel genes, were annotated in this database. The 18 genes were clearly enriched in two clusters: TCF7L2 and HLA (Fig. S3). Three novel genes OASL, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB1, respectively encoding 2′−5′-oligoadenylate synthetase like, major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 2 and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1, were directly connected with the HLA cluster.\n\nThe 43 identified CARD-associated genes were retrieved from the STRING database. Only 4 genes, including 2 novel genes, were annotated in this database. The 4 genes were clearly enriched into two clusters: ALDH2 and LPL (Fig. S4). Two novel genes, ADH7 and CDK8, those respectively encoding alcohol dehydrogenase class 4 mu/sigma chains and cyclin-dependent kinase 8, were directly connected to the two clusters."

    "content": "Results\n\nAssessment of pleiotropic enrichment\n\nWe observed a clear separation between the different Q-Q curves, and the proportion of actual effects in T2D varied considerably across different levels of association for CAD (Fig. 1a, c), which indicated a strong enrichment of T2D-associated SNPs. A similar enrichment pattern was also identified in CAD conditioned on T2D (Fig. 1b, d). We observed an evident upward shift from the expected baseline. It clearly demonstrated the pleiotropy between T2D and CAD (T2D|CAD, CAD|T2D), where T2D conditioned on CAD (T2D|CAD) achieved the most significant pleiotropic enrichment, as an enrichment fold over 20 was observed in Y-axis while comparing the most stringent subset to all SNPs.\n\nT2D loci identified by cFDR\n\nWe identified 98 significant (cFDR ≤ 0.05) CpG-SNPs associated with T2D conditioned on CAD (Fig. 2a), including 79 novel SNPs that have not been reported in association with T2D in previous studies (Table S1). Using a more conservative threshold of cFDR ≤ 0.01, 55 CpG-SNPs (37 novel CpG-SNPs) remained as significant variants.\n\nWe performed a series of bioinformatics analyses to explore the potential regulatory function for these CpG-SNPs. Assuming these CpG-SNPs were partially effective through DNA methylation, we analyzed the meQTL effects of identified CpG-SNPs, where 13 of them showed significant meQTL effects in whole blood (Table S3). In addition, we investigated whether these CpG-SNPs were also associated with T2D through metabolomics regulation. Interestingly, 11 CpG-SNPs showed metaQTL effects, including 4 SNPs (i.e., rs7723, rs1596972, rs17202418, rs2237892) whose associated metabolites (e.g., 1-oleoylglycerophosphocholine, 2-methylbutyroylcarnitine, gamma-glutamylvaline, etc.) have direct connections with the susceptibility of T2D (Table S4). Notably, 7 novel CpG-SNPs (i.e., rs10786044, rs2066612, rs6770420, rs7004862, rs7094128, rs7723, and rs7732628) showed meQTL, eQTL, and metaQTL effects simultaneously and several of them were enriched in enhancer/promoter elements in various tissues (Table 2).\n\nCAD loci identified by cFDR\n\nLikewise, we identified 80 significant (cFDR ≤ 0.05) CpG-SNPs associated with CAD conditioned on T2D (Fig. 2b, Table S2), including 61 novel variants for CAD. Using a more conservative threshold of cFDR ≤ 0.01, 49 significant loci remained (32 novel SNPs).\n\nBy exploring the potential regulatory functions of these significant CpG-SNPs, we found 15 CpG-SNPs showing significant meQTL effects in whole blood (Table S3), and 9 CpG-SNPs associated with various metabolites (Table S4), including some candidates (e.g., butyrylcarnitine, ethylmalonate, cholesterol, etc.) that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of CAD. In particular, two novel CpG-SNPs, rs11172113 and rs3105748, showed meQTL, eQTL, and metaQTL effects simultaneously (Table 2).\n\nPleiotropic loci in T2D and CAD identified with ccFDR\n\nTo further investigate whether any of the SNPs were associated with both T2D and CAD, we computed ccFDR and constructed a ccFDR Manhattan plot (Fig. 2c). Finally, 18 novel pleiotropic CpG-SNPs reached the significance level (ccFDR ≤ 0.05, 8 CpG-SNPs with ccFDR ≤ 0.01) and were annotated to 17 different genes (Table 1). None of these CpG-SNPs have been identified as pleiotropic loci for T2D and CAD in our previous study, yet 6 SNPs have been associated with CAD or T2D separately. Then we analyzed the eQTL, meQTL and metaQTL effects of identified pleiotropic CpG-SNPs and found 8 SNPs have at least one effect. Importantly, one pleiotropic CpG-SNP, rs579459, showed meQTL, eQTL, and metaQTL effects simultaneously, as well as other predicted functions such as alteration of transcription factor binding motif (Table 2).\n\nGO enrichment analysis and protein–protein interaction analysis\n\nBy performing GO enrichment analysis for genes that were nearest to the identified significant CpG-SNPs, we revealed that genes associated with T2D were significantly enriched in biological processes of “pancreas development” (p = 9.73 × 10−6) and “regulation of cellular ketone metabolic process” (p = 3.4 × 10−5), and genes associated with CAD were enriched in GO terms like “apolipoprotein binding” (p = 0.014) (Table 3).\n\nTo further explore and visualize the functional partnership among identified T2D- and CAD-targeted genes, we conducted protein–protein interaction analysis with STRING 10.5 database (Fig. 3). In the protein network plot of T2D (Fig. 3a), proteins including PCSK9, LDLR, PLG, MMP13, and IGF2R, have very close contact and have been proven to have a strong relationship with diabetes. In the protein network of CAD (Fig. 3b), proteins including MTNR1B, GLP2R, GIP, ETS1, and CAMK2G, have close contact and have been associated with CAD.\n\nThe causal effect of T2D on CAD\n\nThough the causal relationship between T2D and CAD has been studied on the whole genome level, the key genes that contribute to such a causality remain unknown. To investigate the effect of specific genes on the causality between T2D and CAD, we applied a gene-specific two-sample MR analysis (see “Methods”) to characterize the causal effect of T2D on CAD. After gene selection, LD assessment, and data harmonization, a total of 17 T2D-related SNPs annotated to 16 different genes (including THADA, CDKN2B-AS1, MTNR1B, etc.) were selected as instrumental variables (the detailed information was summarized in Table S5). The selected instrumental SNPs showed no direct evidence of significant association (Table S5) with CAD, suggesting that these instrument variables are less likely to violate the “no horizontal pleiotropy” assumption (i.e., instrumental variables affect the outcome through a pathway other than the exposure). This was further supported by the results from the MR-Egger regression test where the estimated value for the intercept term was null for T2D and CAD (β = − 0.006, p = 0.374). These results indicated that horizontal pleiotropy does not heavily influence our results. We detected a significant causal relationship of these selected genes between T2D and CAD using MR Egger and IVW methods as main models while using simple mode, weighted median, and weighted mode as additional validations (Figs. 4, S1–S3, Table 4). The result suggests that these genes may be the key factors of the causality between T2D and CAD."

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nBasic demographic data, SNP information, and structure of LD.\n\nThe baseline characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1. The basic information of the 19 genotyped SNPs is summarized in online appendix Table 1 (available at http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0377). Graphical representation of SNPs in relation to the exon-intron structure and the LD pattern between markers are depicted in Fig. 1. We compared the structures of LD across a 419-kb region containing the FTO gene using genotype data from the CHB and CEU HapMap samples. The LD structures across this region shared high similarity between the two populations (online appendix Fig. 1).\n\nAssociation analysis of genetic variants of the FTO gene with obesity and BMI.\n\nThe rs9939609 A allele was identified as the risk variant for obesity in populations of European ancestry. Among the 19 SNPs in this study, the rs9939609 A allele was strongly associated with obesity (P = 7.0 × 10−4) (Table 2) (Fig. 2). The per–A allele increase of odds ratio for obesity was 1.43 (95% CI 1.16–1.75) (Table 2 and online appendix Fig. 2). The association remained significant after correction for multiple testing. The genotypic odds ratio for obesity was 2.60 (1.24–5.46) (P = 0.011) for the AA genotype and 1.32 (1.05–1.66) (P = 0.018) for the AT genotype. The genetic model was best fit with an additive model (P = 7.0 × 10−4, 0.0098, and 0.014 for additive, recessive, and dominant model, respectively). When different criteria for obesity were applied, the associations were also significant (allelic P = 7.6 ×10−4 for obesity defined as BMI ≥28 kg/m2 and 0.0081 for BMI ≥27 kg/m2). The frequency of the rs9939609 A allele (12.6%) was substantially lower in our study than that of European populations (∼45%), corresponding to a lower population-attributable risk fraction of 8.7% in the Chinese population.\n\nThe rs9939609 A allele was also associated with increased BMI (P = 0.0024) (Fig. 2) and weight (P = 0.0065). In our study cohort, carriers with AA genotype ([means ± SD] BMI 31.52 ± 8.76 kg/m2) and AT genotype (28.75 ± 7.89 kg/m2) were heavier than those with TT genotypes (28.08 ± 8.45 kg/m2) (P = 0.0088 and 0.048, respectively) (Fig. 3). The genetic model was best fit with an additive genetic model (P = 0.0024, 0.0091, and 0.073 for additive, recessive, and dominant models, respectively). Each additional copy of the rs9939609 A allele was associated with a BMI increase of a mean 0.124 Z score units, equivalent to ∼0.37 kg/m2 or 1.07 kg body wt for a person 1.7 m tall (online appendix Fig. 2). The extent of variance in BMI explained by rs99399609 was ∼0.5% in the Chinese population.\n\nThere was no heterogeneity in the per–A allele increase of odds ratio for obesity and effect size on BMI among different study populations (online appendix Fig. 2). We did not detect any significant interaction between rs9939609 genotype and age or sex on the risk of obesity or BMI (data not shown).\n\nAssociation analysis of genetic variants of the FTO gene with type 2 diabetes.\n\nWe did not observe significant association between rs9939609 and type 2 diabetes. Two SNPs (rs16952777 and rs1107355) in LD block 1 were nominally associated with type 2 diabetes (Table 3). SNPs in the same block were also nominally associated with fasting glucose concentrations in nondiabetic subjects (online appendix Table 2). However, none of these associations remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing.\n\nAssociation of FTO genetic variants with obesity-related metabolic traits.\n\nResults from the association analysis with other obesity-related metabolic traits are shown in online appendix Table 2. We did not observe significant association between rs9939609 and obesity-related metabolic traits, including fasting glucose, insulin, cholesterols, triglycerides, uric acid, C-reactive protein, and blood pressure. We found nine hypotheses with Pnominal < 0.05, but none of them remained significant after permutation testing. A borderline-significant association result was obtained between homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function and rs1421092 after permutation testing (Ppermuted = 0.054)."

The FTO rs1861869 SNP deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE case/control = 0.863/0.025) and was therefore not included in the analysis. After Bonferroni's correction and a permutation test with 5000 replications for the 30 SNPs, there was no significant difference in allelic frequency for any of the FTO SNPs between the obese and non-obese groups. Table 3 shows the genotype frequencies of all FTO SNPs. There was no significant difference in genotype frequency for any of the FTO SNPs between the obese and non-obese groups.\n\nThe results of testing the single-marker association of 30 FTO SNPs with obesity traits are summarized in Figure 1. After Bonferroni's adjustment was performed for multiple corrections, α was 0.016 (-log10 P = 2.70). The SNP rs17817288 was significantly associated with LDL-C (P = 0.001) in Malaysian Malays after adjustment for age and gender. None of other SNPs presented a significant association with obesity parameters.\n\nFigure 2 shows the LD pattern of the FTO gene. D prime value (D') of 100% indicates the complete LD. D' values of 100% are not shown (the box is empty). The boxes in bright red are with D' values of 100%. The boxes with values of D' < 100% are in shades of pink or red.

    "content": "Results\n\nAlleles at 10 out of 22 SNPs (mapping to introns 1, 2, and 3) showed suggestive evidence (P ≤ 0.05) for an association with BMI variation in either standard association test, independent maternal or paternal association tests (Fig. 1, Table 2). Individual re-genotyping of 2 variants (rs8050136, rs8053740) within FTO revealed reproducibility of the genotypes of 99.59% and 99.60%, respectively thus reducing the chance of technical artifacts.\n\nStandard association tests for BMI variation in the Sorbs data set\n\nUsing a standard association test analysis in 525 subjects out of 948 without taking into account the parent-of-origin, we identified the strongest association with BMI for two variants in intron 3 (rs17818920, rs17818902; Fig. 1, Table 2). This is in line with our previously reported GWAS on BMI variation in the Sorbs population (N = 948) which identified the strongest association signals not in intron 1 but intron 3 with the best association signals at rs17818902 and rs17818920.\n\nParent-of-origin association tests for BMI variation in the Sorbs data set\n\nAmong the 22 SNPs, 10 variants show differences in association when evaluating paternal or maternal alleles, separately. Three of the 10 variants (rs1861868, rs1121980, rs9939973; all intron 1) confer different effect directions between paternal and maternal alleles (Fig. 1, Table 2). Especially, two of them (rs1121980 and 9939973) show stronger, albeit still non-significant, relationships when considering alleles paternally transmitted compared to a standard association test setting (P≤0.05). Particularly, applying a Student´s t-Test comparing linear regression derived effect estimations (beta values) between paternal and maternal association tests revealed nominal differences at these SNPs (P≤0.05; Table 2). Interestingly, rs1121980 and rs9939973 are in high LD with rs8050136 (Fig. 2), one of the well replicated variants strongly associated with BMI (e.g.). Regional plots for FTO comparing especially introns 1 and 3 under the different association tests are shown in Fig. 1. Among five SNPs in intron 3, we observed the smallest p-values for two variants in standard association tests. We further identified three out of five variants consistently showing indications for stronger effects in maternally transmitted alleles (Table 2). Similar results were obtained for a variant in intron 2 (rs10852522; Table 2) but the difference to paternal effects was not significant at any of these variants. In conclusion, we identified 10 FTO variants harboring suggestive evidence for association with BMI variation when taking into account allelic transmission from mother or father. Particularly, two of these variants within intron 1 (rs1121980, rs9939973) show, compared to association tests ignoring the parental origin, stronger effects for BMI along with evidence for differences in the effect sizes between paternal and maternal transmissions.\n\nLD plots were generated for the Sorbs population using Haploview 4.2. Pairwise r2 values are shown from black (r2 = 1) to white (r2 = 0).\n\nParental asymmetry tests (PAT) in the childhood obesity trios from Germany\n\nWe analyzed the 10 variants identified in the Sorbs data set in an independent data set of 705 trios comprising an extremely obese child or adolescent and both biological parents (Table 3). Albeit we do not observe evidence for POE effects for variants in intron 1 (all P>0.30; Table 3), we identified suggestive evidence for potential POE for variants in intron 2 and 3 (P≤0.05; Table 3). Notably, consistent with stronger effect sizes of maternal alleles compared to paternal alleles in intron 2 and 3 in the Sorbs we found higher transmission rates for maternal alleles in the trio data set."

Energy and macronutrient intakes did not differ in cases and controls (Table 1).\n\nThe allele and genotype frequency of the two groups are shown in Table 2. Genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the total population, and did not differ between the two groups. The median of GRS among participants was 6. \n\nInteractions of MDS and FTO SNPs in relation to obesity are shown in Table 3. MDS modulated the association of FTO SNPs with obesity. Individuals with minor allele carriers of rs9939973, rs8050136, rs1781749, and rs3751812 had lower risk of obesity when they had higher MDS, compared to wild-type homozygote genotype carriers.

    "content": "RESULTS\n\nOn average, individuals of the BD group were younger than those of the BDC group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The overview descriptive characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 1. Regarding the mean BMI, there were no significant differences between the two groups; however, after BMI stratification, the BD group showed a higher prevalence of overweight than the BDC; while the BDC group showed a higher frequency of obesity (chi‐square test, p < 0.05).\n\nDifferential association of variants in FTO between obesity and bipolar disorder\n\nSet‐based association analysis with BD as the phenotype trait revealed that two regions reached a statistically significant association, intron 2 of RPGRIP1L and the FTO upstream region. A summary of the set‐based association analysis is reported in Table 2. When we considered BMI as a continuous variable for the whole sample (BD and BDC groups), variants in intron 1 promoter flanking of FTO reached statistical significance (p < 0.05) and after diagnosis stratification this association remained only in the BD group (p < 0.05), even when the BDC group had a higher rate of obesity.\n\nThe analysis of single‐variants revealed that seven variants reached a statistically significant association with BD (p < 0.05); these BD‐associated variants were mapped to intron 2 of RPGRIP1L, FTO upstream region and intron 1 promoter flanking of FTO. When we considered obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) as phenotype, 14 variants in the promoter flanking region immersed in FTO intron 1 reached a statistically significant association (p < 0.05). Rs7205859, in the promoter flanking region immersed in intron 1 of FTO, was the only variant associated to BD and obesity (p < 0.05).\n\nPrediction of functional impact (“in silico”) of variants in the developing brain\n\nIn order to correlate associated variants with expression‐regulatory elements that could alter brain development, we performed a query of the associated variants to different databases. After mapping the associated variants with expression‐regulatory elements in DNA, we found that BD‐associated variants are in high linkage disequilibrium with an enhancer located in intron 1 of RPGRIP1L; while obesity‐associated variants are in high linkage disequilibrium with an enhancer located in intron 1 of FTO, suggesting a possible differential role of FTO variants in BD and obesity. The inclusion of genomic information at different levels is summarized in Figure 1. We also mapped variants that could modulate binding sites of transcription factors with a query to SNP2TFBS database. BD‐associated variants could disturb binding sites of SP1, SP2, IRF1, PAX4 and RUNX2; whereas obesity‐associated variants could disturb binding sites of IRF1, PAX5, ARID3A, KLF1, KLF4, KLF5 and FOXP1. The description of variants that disrupt binding sites of the previous TF is shown in Table 3, including alleles and the identifier of variants. Additionally, we searched for transcription factors that could modulate neurodevelopment; we filtered only transcription factors highly expressed in the brain during prenatal brain stages, with a query to the BrainSpan database: SP1 and SP2 for BD‐associated variants and FOXP1 for obesity‐associated variants. The mapping expression of these transcription factors revealed that SP1 and SP2 are highly expressed in the ganglionic eminence, while FOXP1 is highly expressed in the striatum brain zone at prenatal stages."

Subjects were equally randomized allocated in MeD group and CTR group. During this clinical trial, 11 subjects from MeD group and 101 subjects from CTR group abandoned the study as specified in Fig. 1. In fact, 5 subjects form the MeD group abandoned the study for poor weight loss results and 6 subjects for poor adherence to the diet therapy. On the other hand, in the CTR group 101 subjects abandoned the study since they did not see any kind of health benefits or improvement. The final sample analyzed consisted of 188 patients, divided as follow: 139 subjects in MeD group and 49 for CTR group. These patients successfully participated and completed the study protocol. \n\nIn our sample, the HWE was respected (p > 0.05). The comprehensive description of the whole sample population at baseline can be seen in Table 1. All results were stated as mean and standard deviation. The average age of the individuals was 46.83 ± 15.01 years, 62.2% females and 37.8% males (Table 1). According to the statistical analysis, at baseline, carriers and no carriers differs significantly only for age, diastolic blood pressure, R, basophils count and unsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids intake (p < 0.05) (Table 1). Genotype frequencies of our individuals (TT: 0.310; AA: 0.190; AT: 0.500) are similar to the ones shown in TSI population (TT: 0.327, AA: 0.252, AT: 0.421), and the same result was demonstrated about the allele frequencies, similar between TSI (T: 0.537; A: 0.463) and our sample (T: 0.550; A: 0.450) (Table 2). The average BMI of the subject was 29.39 ± 6.99, and the average Total FM (kg) was 37.3 ± 9.76. Finally, in order to have a detailed description of the sample, in Table 3 the individuals, at the baseline, were divided by genotype and categorized according to phenotype classification.   \n\nAt baseline, differences were highlighted between TT genotype and A carriers for age, DBP, BCM (kg), basophils (1000/μL), unsaturated fatty acids (g) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (g) intake (p < 0.05).\n\nAmong the genotype/treatment groups significances were found for SBP between control group TT genotype and Med group TT genotype, DBP between control group TT genotype and the other groups (control group A carriers, Med group TT genotype and Med group A carriers) and neck circumference between control group TT genotype and Med group A carriers, control group A carriers and Med group TT genotype and Med group A carriers (p < 0.05). No other statistical significance were found at baseline between groups.\n\nInfluences of FTO rs9939609 and nutritional intervention on BMI, body composition and metabolism\n\nIn this study, the GLM analysis was used to demonstrate the statistical significance between FTO rs9939609 carriers A and TT genotype together with the nutritional intervention.\n\nAccording to the results, TBFat (kg) decreases dependently both of the nutritional intervention (pD = 0.00) and the interaction gene-diet (pGD = 0.04), showing a significant difference between MeD and CTR, but also suggesting a potential role, even though not statistically significant, of FTO rs9939609 (pG = 0.06), since A carrier CTR gained weight sensibly more than TT genotype CTR, and A carrier MeD lost more weight than TT genotype MeD (MeD/TT genotype = − 3.59 ± 4.78; MeD/A carriers = − 3.97 ± 6.97; CTR/TT genotype = 1.93 ± 5.54; CTR/A carriers = 6.11 ± 9.60) (Table 4). Furthermore, MeD group, regardless of FTO rs9939609 (pG = 0.70; pGD = 0.32) (Table 4), lost a higher amount of Gynoid BFat (%) compared to CTR (p = 0.04) (MeD/TT genotype = − 2.94 ± 5.14; MeD/A carriers = − 1.67 ± 3.51; CTR/TT genotype = 0.03 ± 1.26; CTR/A carriers = − 0.42 ± 1.74) (Table 4). \n\nThe bioelectrical impedance analysis highlighted that TBW, was significantly reduced in A carriers compared to TT genotype (pG = 0.02), independently of nutritional intervention (pD = 0.48; pGD = 0.47) (MeD/TT genotype = − 0.83 ± 1.63; MeD/A carriers = − 1.88 ± 4.35; CTR/TT genotype = 0.70 ± 3.04; CTR/A carriers = − 1.75 ± 3.28) (Table 4). All the other results were not statistically significant (p > 0.05)."

    "content": "Results\n\nFunctional annotation of LD SNPs in exons\n\n132 exon SNPs were identified in linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.5) with the 65 tag SNPs for type 2 diabetes. Among these linked SNPs, only 37 (28%) locate in the coding region, including 20 synonymous and 17 missense SNPs. While the synonymous SNPs are usually known as benign variants which not change the coding products, the missense SNPs are potential to generate deleterious single amino acids substitutions. We preliminarily estimated the functional effects of these 17 missense SNPs by using four well-established tools SIFT, Polyphen2, PROVEAN and FATHAMM, respectively. The results are summarized in the Table 1. Six SNPs (rs2228603, rs58542926, rs17240268, rs13266634, rs1260326, rs1051334) were regarded as suspected in generating deleterious single amino acid changes which was predicted dysfunction by at least one algorithm. The rs13266634 is firmly associated with decreased insulin release. The effects of rs58542926 could influence the hepatic fibrosis progression in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The rs2228603 is most strongly associated with hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC), an index closely related to fatty liver disease. The rs1260326 is another missense variant related with hyperglycemia, which was also related with liver fat content confirmed in a very recent work. The rs17240268 and rs1051334 were also analyzed in some works but no conclusions were drawn that they are relevant to onset of T2D. For the other exon SNPs, located in the UTR regions, ten have phased genotype information for both T2D samples and healthy controls. We then investigated whether these SNPs involved in the microRNA binding by the integrated resources of miRcode and miRNASNP database. Three SNPs were identified related to gain/loss target of miRNA. One regulated gene NOTCH2 was reported in pathogenesis of T2D in previous works (see Table 2).\n\nLD SNPs affect TF binding in Promoter regions\n\nWe then investigated those SNPs located in the promoter regions for their effects on the transcript factor binding. 2 kb upstream and downstream of the transcript start site (TSS) was taken as the TSS region which harbors proximal promoters. Through using the FunciSNP by taking TSS regions as the biofeatures, we detected 252 high LD (r2 > 0.5) SNPs. These SNPs involving in TF binding sites are likely to alter response elements, further possibly affect regulated genes. Limited by the experimentally verified TF binding motif, two well-established tools, HORMER and FIMO, were employed to define the binding motif in the promoter regions. The former used build-in known motifs and the later employed TF binding profiles from JASPAR 2016. 188 LD SNPs were found involved in binding sites, among which 125 SNPs related to more than two binding events. Firstly, the activity of SNPs and motifs are simply measured by counting the number of affected motifs and disturbing SNPs in respectively (See details in Supplementary Table S2). On our hypothesis that the active SNPs/motifs are largely considered increasing risks in gene dysregulations. Actually, we have found some cases related to T2D in high ranking SNPs/motifs. For example, Ptf1a, identified as the most heavily affected motif in HOMER, is broadly accepted as a vital TF in pancreases functions. To further assess the effects of LD SNPs on likely transcription factor binding sites, we used motifbreakR to identify the extent that how much information gain or lost in a loci where the alternate allele compares to the reference allele. Through an in-house calculating by R program, we separately obtain effects that the 188 LD SNPs play on HOMER motifs and JASPAR motifs with default setting (See details in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Among these LD SNPs in TSS region, only 17 SNPs are genotyped in our GWAS data, thus we analyze these genotyped SNPs. The results from motifbreakR are collectively displayed in Supplementary Table S5. We found all the genotyped SNPs have strong effects on binding more or less, but how much the correlation with the T2D related genes? We next made an analysis on the function of the related genes.\n\nFunctional annotation of TF affected genes\n\nTo identify the T2D related genes that may affected by the TF binding, we first collected the nearby genes of the TSS SNPs and analyzed their functions by DAVID. Finally, we got 13 enrichments for representing function of the TSS SNP related genes. The highest enrichment score is 5.29 and it contains only four disease terms directly towards type 2 diabetes (see Supplementary Fig. S1A). The second cluster (enrichment score: 2.02; Supplementary Fig. S1B) tremendously associated with the GO terms about biological process of homeostasis. We took out genes from the top two enrichments (enrichment score >2): CDKAL1, ADIPOQ, WFS1, NOTCH2, MAEA, THADA, PROX1, IGF2BP2, PPARG, ADAM30 and GCKR. Comparing with 65 known risk SNPs related genes, we found that ADIPOQ and ADAM30 are only related to LD SNPs. Actually, both of them are not newly detected T2D related genes. ADIPOQ is expressed in adipose tissue exclusively and it is dysregulated in obesity. ADAM30 is also frequently discussed in T2D researches because it is related to some proxy SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with risk SNPs. Next, we look up genes in aforementioned two enrichment sets from TF strong related genes in Supplementary Table S5. As a result, only one gene, the PPARG, is hit among T2D high correlated genes. By inspection, it is a vital gene appeared in dozen of T2D researches and it mainly expresses in adipose tissue. Once it was designed as target of small molecules in curing T2D and obesity. The SNPs strongly affect TF binding and further possibly dysregulate genes are treated as putative high risk SNPs (red one in Supplementary Table S5).\n\nT2D risk-related SNPs in distal regulatory elements\n\nWe have analyzed the T2D LD SNPs in exon and promoter region. Actually, most of LD SNPs do not fall within these areas but in non-coding regions. They don’t have close relation with specify genes or gene correlated promoter regions, which make them not easily to be interpreted. However, still it is possible that a LD SNP laying in distal regulatory element increases T2D risk by activating or repressing gene expressions. To address this issue, we use histone marks to determine which of the LD SNPs are likely to be part of regulatory elements. Four histone modifications for pancreas and pancreas islet are obtained from the NIH Roadmap Epigenome Mapping consortium, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac associated with gene activation and H3K27me3 related to gene repression. We broadly retrieved candidate risk SNPs by separately using these eight histone modification datasets as biofeatures in FunciSNP. As a result, 2786 unique SNPs are in high LD (r2 > 0.5) with known risk SNPs and 191 of these unique SNPs are successfully genotyped in our T2D GWAS data. Only genotyped SNPs can be utilized in risk model, so we limit our studies to prioritizing the genotyped LD SNPs. Among the SNPs strongly affected TFs, those ultimately regulating expressed genes are considered as high risk SNPs. The prioritizing procedure includes three steps to choose SNPs with high probability in regulating genes. The first step, we inspect the overlapped SNPs involving in distal regulatory element and transcription factor binding sites, 128 of 191 genotyped SNPs affected at least one motif. Secondly, like the procedure in analyzing TSS SNPs, we retrieved the SNPs that have strong effects on binding assessed by motifbreakR. The threshold set to 0.85 to obtain SNPs having strong effects on binding, only seven SNPs are eliminated in this process. The final step, we download the RNA-seq data of pancreas and pancreas-islet from NIH epigenomic roadmap and calculated the FPKM values of genes by using cufflinks (reference genome: RefSeq gene, hg19). 649 genes (FPKM > 1) are considered as expressed genes. Next, we inspect the SNPs whose strongly affected transcript factors targeting at these expressed genes. As a result, 18 SNPs involved in regulating gene expression and two expressed genes (JUN, FOXC1) are affected (see Supplementary Table S6).\n\nSNPs involved in co-occurrence of histone marks\n\nHistone modifications are known to act in a combinatorial fashion n to determine the overall outcome of gene expression. Besides, it is believed that combinational transcription factor binding existed in human gene transcription. In a recent work, Lorenzo found that five β-cell transcription factors frequently bind to overlapping genomic sites. However, the gene transcription mechanism driven by these combinational effects remain poorly described. How a tiny variant effect is amplified in these combined events is yet to know. Driven by these concerns and support from existing works, we preliminarily discussed SNPs residing in the colocalizations of histone marks. Among the genotyped SNPs related to histone modifications, the numbers of SNPs occupying the overlaps between two histone marks are listed in Fig. 2. In general, the activation related histone modifications harbored more high LD SNPs, which is in consistent with Lorenzo’s finding that risk SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes are enriched in clustered islet enhancers. Besides, the minimized overlapping existed between H3K27me3 and H3K27ac. Once, Reena found that H3K4me3 marks and H3K27me3 marks are usually mutually exclusive in islets. In this work, H3K27me3 marks broadly harbored less overlapped SNPs with the activation marks. Our results supported Reena’s finding, but the underlying mechanism need to be addressed in future works. The similar results can be obtained by using all LD (r2 > 0.5) SNPs related to histone modifications, the results are shown in Fig. S2. Considering the localization offsets between tissues, we separately obtained 188 and 166 overlapped SNPs in islet and pancreas. The intersections (163 SNPs) between them are of high confidence affecting multiply histone marks. To further address their potential risks in T2D pathogenesis, we identified those strongly affect motifs in aforementioned works and located in active enhancer clusters which were demonstrated to be regions where are bound by multiple transcription factors in a recent research. Finally, 102 and 16 SNPs remained respectively. The annotation results of histone marks related SNPs are summarized in Supplementary Table S6, rs7901695 and rs2612069 meet all three conditions set in detecting SNPs affecting regulations, rs7901695 had been reported in many T2D researches, rs2612069 was reported as a T2D related SNP in Ballantyne’s very recent work. Besides, three of them (rs1333051, rs1531343, rs1470579) were reported as the confirmed T2D risk SNPs in Europeans in a recent work. We also provide the number of eQTL hits which are obtained from HaploReg for SNPs in histone marks (see details in Supplementary Table S7). Here we have finished the functional annotation of 65 T2D related risk SNPs, a detailed circos plot (Fig. 3) summarized the locations and annotations of known risk SNPs. In Fig. 3, the potential risk LD SNPs, those pointed by shot orange lines, were further employed by risk model.\n\nThe cumulative effects of risk SNPs\n\nSo far the underling mechanism of such risk SNPs is unknown; it is believed that single SNPs have too modest effects to lead pathogenic changes. Although the developing GWAS study was increasing the number of identified risk SNPs of T2D, the updating researches find the predicting evaluation is small by using latest risk SNPs. However, the accumulation of such modest effects is considered to widen the implicated process leading to T2D over a lifetime. To address this issue, we count the risk alleles of all the high risk SNPs and compared the deviation of unweighted genotype scores distribution between T2D samples and healthy controls. At different genotypic risk scores by summing up risk alleles of SNPs from different genomic regions, generally, a greater proportion of T2D individuals carry more risk alleles than healthy controls (t-test, P = 1.5583 × 10−51). Besides, the degree of separation between two distributions increased along with the increasing number of risk SNPs (see Fig. 4).\n\nAssociation and discrimination using putative risk SNPs\n\nUnlike previous works adding genotypic risk score to multiple clinical factors to improve risk model, we primarily test the accumulative effects of putative risk SNPs. We used the 17 genotyped SNPs of 65 known risk SNPs as the benchmark. The putative high risk SNPs identified in aforementioned functional annotation works are employed as new biomarkers in logistic regression and discrimination. The model 1 and model 2 were fitted by using benchmark data set and all SNPs respectively. The two models were compared by Chi-squared test (P = 2.2 × 10−16). The regression coefficients of all putative risk SNPs are estimated from logistic regression model. SNPs with P-value less than 0.05 were listed in Table 3. Next, we obtained the AROC result from the discrimination based on unweighted genotype score. We compared the performances by integrating benchmark sets with SNPs from different genomic regions. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The AROC for the known risk SNPs is 0.58. It marginally increased to 0.59 after the addition of exon SNPs and TSS SNPs. The AROC reached 0.62 when the genotype sore is generated by summing up risk alleles of all SNPs. The addition of histone SNPs almost reached the greatest AROC value. Although the magnitude of improvement seems small still, it is worth noting that the genotype score is the only feature in the risk model. Moreover, its cumulative effect was detected in prediction, we anticipated that it will enhance the risk model by integrating with multiple well established clinical factors.\n\nNet reclassification improvement\n\nFurthermore, the contribution of our identified putative risk SNPs are assessed by net reclassification improvement (NRI) measurement, which representing the proportion of individuals that correctly move from one category to another while the new risk biomarkers are added into the regression model, i.e. a T2D individual shift to a higher risk category or a heathy control step into the lower risk categories. The unweighted genotype score including all putative risk variants are added into the reclassification and the results are shown in Table 4. With The risk cutoff of (≥0.2, 0.2–0.4, 0.4–0.6, ≤0.6), we obtain a categorical NRI of 10.03% [95% CI: 6.58%–13.46%; P < 0.001], composed of an absent NRI of −0.63% and a present NRI of 10.66%, which indicated that he addition of new risk markers primarily enhanced the identification of T2D samples. For the continuous NRI, which is free from cutoff point, the improvement is 23.48% [95% CI: 17.86%–29.11%; P < 0.001], and for IDI, the improvement is 0.0249 [95% CI: 0.0199–0.0299; P < 0.001]."

    "content": "Results\n\nSimulation\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the type I error rates of the scan statistics were close to nominal levels (0.01, 0.05) as a function of sample sizes (2a, 2b). Power monotonically increases with sample size, effect size (δ), or nominal level (α) (2c–2f). Even with a very small α, for effect size greater than 0.15 and the sample size of up to 4,500, the scan statistics remained to have >80% power (2e, 2f).\n\nAnalysis of the EPIC Norfolk data\n\nSingle trait results\n\nThe model provided the usual association results for single trait adjusted for sex and age including effect size estimate, proportion of variance explained and statistical significance. Results on BMI, waist and hip circumferences were also similar for PRS. Shown in Figure S1 and Table S2 are SEM and results of the 12 SNPs in the 12 gene regions adjusted for sex and age for single trait (a1,b1,c1) as with distribution of their PRS and cumulative effects of these variants (a2,b2 c2). More details can be found in  Information S2 .\n\nMulti-trait results\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, none of the SNPs were significant at 10−4 level according to single-SNP –single-trait tests nor according to sliding window sizes of 1–4 SNPs at the 10−5 level, but smaller p values were obtained for window sizes of 5–11 and 12–15 SNPs. Of particular interest was rs7204609∼rs9939881 at the first intron of FTO with , P = 4.29×10−7 for a sliding window of size 10; its model structure is shown in Figure 4. The standardized overall effect (95% CI) of the genome region on body shape was −0.100 (−014- −0.08) without adjustment for sex and age, and −0.09 (−0.13- −0.07) with adjustment. The effect (95%CI) of a specific SNP on body shape or on a single trait are available −0.09 (−0.08- −0.08) and 0.07 (−0.06- −0.05) after adjusting for sex and age, respectively for rs58044769. These results suggest that the location of the causal variant in the 10-SNP loading vector is likely between the rs58044769 and rs11642841 (the sixth SNP).\n\n Figure 5a and Table 1 show models and results of the 12 SNPs in the 12 gene regions adjusted for sex and age, where the standardized effect (λSNP⋅β21) (95%CI) per allele on body shape was 0.08 (0.07–0.10, P = 7.91×10−24). The proportion of variance explained was 0.8% by PRS. All genetic variants showed associations with body shape, though some loadings of the SNPs were not significant at α = 0.05 (Table 1). There were substantial variations in standardized effects of each SNP with the largest being rs1121980 (FTO) and rs925646 (BDNF) for all the four traits, followed by rs6538238 (TMEM18), rs17782313 (MC4R) for BMI and hip; rs17782313 (MC4R), rs7132908 (FAIM2) for waist and body shape. Non-standardized effect sizes were largest with rs1121980 (FTO) (0.39), but smallest with rs7647305 (ETV5) (0.05) (see also Figures 5 and S1).\n\nShown in Figure 5b is the distribution of PRS and cumulative effects of these variants, from which we made the following observations: (1) PRS was normally distributed, with ranges of 0.05–1.69 for body shape, with the majority (68.27%) of individuals () also showing similar patterns of PRS (0.86±0.21); (2) for each level of PRS the distribution of body shape had similar pattern according to boxplots, generally normally distributed with range 0.4–1.3 for PRS but skewed with <0.4 or >1.3; (3) The means of body shape score increased linearly with PRS, with on average each additional unit associated with increments (P) of 2.28 (7.91×10−24).\n\nShown in Table 2 and Figure 6 are the distribution of body shape types and characteristics of body shape score in the EPIC-Norfolk replication samples, from which several observations can be made. (1) types (men%, women%) were predominantly 1 (29.30%, 33.87%), 4 (31.58%, 19.35%) and 5 (16.55%, 11.61%). There was significant sex difference of overall body shape types (χ 2 = 1556.8, P<.0001), especially in types 4, 5, 6, 9, 2, 3; (2) for both men and women, along with the risk of obesity, body shape score was seen to be monotonically increasing from types 1 to 9 (Table 2 and Figures 6c, 6d), with significant differences between given two types (F = 1994.80, P<0.0001 for men, F = 2468.78, P<0.0001 for women, both with p<0.05 according to SNK test). Linear regression between the scores and types had good fit for men (F = 15214.2, P<0.0001, R 2 = 0.71) and women (F = 17574.2, P<0.0001, R 2 = 0.74) (Figures 6c, 6d), suggesting body shape score is an excellent measure; (3) BSS follows an approximate normal distribution (see Figure S2); (4) The estimated BMIs and waist-hip ratios (WHRs) were 29.52 and 0.97 for men, 30.25 and 0.83 for women, respectively.

    "content": "3. Results\n\n3.1. Characteristics of the Population and Association of Leptin Levels with BMI in Men and Women\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the demographic, clinical, biochemical, lifestyle characteristics and plasma leptin concentrations of the 1011 subjects according to sex (n = 366 men and n = 645 women).\n\nParticipants were high cardiovascular risk subjects aged 55–80 years. Leptin concentrations (unadjusted model) were 2.6 times higher (p = 1.7 × 10−89) in women (34.3+/−0.9 ng/mL) than in men (13.1+/−0.7 ng/mL). Figure 1 shows the dotplot for plasma leptin concentrations (ln) in men and women. p-values for several adjusted models are also presented. The age adjustment did not change the statistical significance (using the ln-transformation) of the differences between men and women (p1 = 9.3 × 10−89). Additional adjustment for diabetes, smoking, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and physical activity (p3) slightly reduced the statistical significance of the differences in leptin levels between men and women, but those differences still prevailed (p3 = 1.5 × 10−68).\n\nAs expected, plasma leptin levels in our population had a high association with BMI. Figure 2 shows the sex-specific scatter plot and the linear adjustment between plasma leptin levels (Ln) and BMI in both men and women. We observed a highly statistically significant direct correlation between these parameters (r = 0.52; p = 9.8 × 10−27 in men and r = 0.57; p = 2.5 × 10−56 in women).\n\n3.2. Association between the Selected SNPs in Candidate Genes (LEP, SLC32A1, GCKR, CCNL, COBLL1, and FTO) and Plasma Leptin Concentrations\n\nFirst we tested the association between plasma leptin levels and the SNP in the candidate genes selected as the most relevant in the GWAS of Kilpeläin et al. for circulating leptin levels: rs10487505-LEP, rs6071166-SLC32A, rs780093-GCKR, rs900400-CCNL1, rs6738627-COBLL1, and rs8043757-FTO; or their proxies (r2 > 0.8), when the SNP itself was not in the genotyping array. The following proxies (indicating the LD with the initial SNP), were used: rs2167289-LEP (r2 = 0.81), rs6027422-SLC32A (r2 = 1.0), rs17451107-CCNL1 (r2 = 0.92), rs7609045-COBLL1 (r2 = 0.98), and rs17817449-FTO (r2 = 1.0). Table 2 shows the results for the whole population (n = 966 subjects with valid genome-wide data including 351 men and 615 women), both in the unadjusted model (Model 1) and that adjusted for age and sex (Model 2).\n\nIn neither of them is a statistically significant association observed between the candidate SNPs and plasma leptin levels in our Mediterranean population. Neither did the additional adjustment of the results for BMI alter the statistical significance of the associations (Supplemental Table S1). Moreover, an additional adjustment of the models for diabetes did not contribute to increasing the statistical significance of the associations either (not shown). Likewise, additional adjustment for smoking, physical activity, and adherence to Mediterranean diet did not change the statistical significance (not shown). We then carried out an analysis stratified by men (Table 3) and women (Table 4).\n\nIn men, we did not find any association between any of the candidate SNPs and plasma leptin levels in any of the models studied. However, in women, we did find several associations. In the crude model (Model 1), the SNP rs17451107-CCNL1 was significantly associated with lower leptin levels in carriers of the minor allele (B = −0.085 +/−0.041; p = 0.038). In addition, the rs780093 SNP in the GCKR gene was significantly associated with leptin levels in the crude model (p = 0.049), with lower leptin levels in carriers of the minor allele. Nevertheless, on adjusting for age, the rs78009-GCKR SNP lost statistical significance.\n\nThe additional adjustment for BMI (Supplemental Table S2) did not take statistical significance away from the rs17451107-CCNL1, which remained associated with plasma leptin levels even after a later adjustment in model 3 for diabetes (p = 0.0014, not shown).\n\nThese results not only indicate some heterogeneity per sex, but also that the characteristics of this population (either of geographic origin or being a high cardiovascular risk) are important if the results of the most important SNP associations reported in the meta-analysis of Kilpeläin et al.’s GWAS are not replicated. We, therefore, decided to investigate whether other SNPs in the same candidate genes could be more associated with leptin levels and better reflect the genetic characteristics of this population.\n\n3.3. Screening of SNPs in the LEP, SLC32A1, GCKR, CCNL, COBLL1, FTO, and LEPR Genes for Investigating Their Association with Plasma Leptin Levels\n\nWe obtained the genotype of all the SNPs in/near the LEP, SLC32A1, GCKR, CCNL, COBLL1, FTO, and LEPR genes that were included in the Human OmniExpress array, and their associations with plasma leptin levels in the whole populations were investigated. Table 5 shows the SNP, MAF, beta, and p-values for the association of the top-ranked SNPs in the whole population (n = 966). Top-ranked SNPs were listed three times in accordance with each statistical model (Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3). We can observe that, in this population, the SNPs in the LEPR have a highly significant association with leptin levels, both in the crude model and in the models adjusted for age and sex, the rs10749753-LEPR SNP (MAF: 0.30) being the one that presented the highest statistical significance (p = 0.016) in the whole population, with the minor allele related with higher leptin levels. Even after adjustment for BMI, that SNP maintained its statistical significance (p = 0.001). Some SNPs in the FTO gene were also shown to be associated with plasma leptin levels (i.e., rs1075440-FTO; p = 0.017 or rs17819063-FTO; p = 0.031), and unlike what happens in the GWAS of Kilpeläin et al., several SNPs in the FTO gene do not lose their statistical significance in their association with leptin, even after adjustment for BMI (i.e., rs1075440-FTO; p = 0.037 or rs17819063-FTO; p = 0.016). Further adjustment for diabetes did not change the statistical significance of the associations.\n\nOn analyzing the SNP*sex interaction determining plasma leptin levels, we found several statistically significant interaction terms (Supplemental Table S3). The most significant SNP*sex interactions were with the rs9436297-LEPR and rs1362570-FTO SNPs (p-interaction SNP*sex = 0.003 and p-interaction = 0.010, respectively). That shows these polymorphisms to be heterogeneous per sex in their association with leptin levels. On stratifying the association of the SNPs with leptin levels for men (Table 6) and women (Table 7), we observed that the SNPs that presented the greatest associations with leptin in men are those found in the FTO gene (the rs1075440-FTO being the top-ranked after adjustment for age and BMI; p = 0.010), whereas in women it was mainly the LEPR gene (the rs12145690-LEPR was the top-ranked after adjustment of age and BMI; p < 0.001).\n\nSome of these SNPs were in LD, but not others. Supplemental Figure S1 shows the LD plots (r2 values) for the FTO (panel A) and the LEPR (B) statistically significant SNPs.\n\n3.4. GWAS for Plasma Leptin Concentrations in This Mediterranean Population\n\nFinally, we undertook a GWAS in order to investigate which SNPs at the genome-wide level were more significantly associated with plasma leptin levels in this population. Supplemental Figure S2 shows the corresponding Q–Q plot for this GWAS. Table 8 shows the results obtained for the top-ranked SNPs, in the model adjusted for age and sex for the whole population and Supplemental Table S4 shows the results of the model additionally adjusted for BMI. Additional adjustment for diabetes did not change the statistical significance of the associations (not shown). No SNP reached statistical significance at the GWAS level (p < 5 × 10−8), a foreseeable result bearing in mind the low level of statistical significance achieved in the prior meta-analysis of thousands of participants. Various SNPs, however, did achieve a statistical significance of p < 1 × 10−5, suggestive of an association at the GWAS level that would require confirmation in other studies.\n\nThe top-ranked SNP in the unadjusted model (Model 1) was rs245908 (p = 1.95 × 10−7), located in the CHN2 (Chimerin 2) gene (Figure 3). After adjustment for sex and age, the top-ranked SNP was the rs10737381 located at LOC105378641, on chromosome 1 (Supplemental Figure S3). The second top-ranked SNP was again the rs245908-CHN2. The CHN2 gene is located on chromosome 7 and encodes a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-metabolizing protein.\n\nAlthough no previous works link this gene with plasma leptin concentrations, there are prior known associations with obesity and diabetes. The minor allele of this gene was associated with lower plasma leptin concentrations. Supplemental Figure S4 shows the dotplot for plasma leptin concentrations (ln) depending on the CHN2 SNP (unadjusted values). Figure 4 shows the adjusted means of plasma leptin concentrations in the whole population after adjustment for sex, age, and diabetes (A), and additionally adjusted for BMI (B). Even additional adjustment for BMI, the rs245908-CHN2 remained significantly adjusted with leptin levels. Results were similar in men and women (not shown).\n\nWhen we tested the SNP*sex interactions at the genome-wide level in determining leptin levels we obtained a statistically significant interaction at the GWAS level, involving the SLIT3 (Slit Guidance Ligand 3) gene as well as some SNP*sex interactions at the suggestive GWAS level. Figure 5 shows the corresponding Manhattan plot showing the p-values for these interactions as well as the SNP having p-values for the interaction term with sex <1.0 × 10−5. The top-ranked SNP for the interaction with sex was the rs11954861-SLIT3 (p = 1.1 × 10−8) and was located on chromosome 5. Supplemental Figure S5 shows the regional plot. The second top-ranked SNP for the sex-SNP interactions (p = 5.2 × 10−6) was the rs1146714 (intergenic), located on chromosome 1 (Supplemental Figure S6).\n\nTable 9 shows the top-ranked p-values for the SNP*sex interaction terms, as well as the effect (beta) for plasma leptin concentrations in men and women. The minor allele for the rs11954861-SLIT3 SNP was associated with higher plasma leptin levels in men, but with a decrease in women. Although some previous investigations have reported sex-specific effects for the SLIT3 gene, including its differential gene expression regulated by estrogens as well as for the associations between the SLIT3 gene and several parameters, this is the first time that SLIT3-sex-specific differences in plasma leptin have been found. Likewise, for the other top-ranked genes, we suggest sex-SNP interactions (Table 9).\n\nOur findings are novel and more research in characterizing these interactions has to be done. Considering the scarcity of data from sex-specific GWAS in determining plasma leptin concentrations, we present the association results including the top-ranked SNPs in men (Supplemental Table S5) and women (Supplemental Table S6) for further comparisons in subsequent studies. In men, the top-ranked SNP both in the unadjusted and in the model adjusted for sex, was the rs-4074110 (intergenic) at p < 1 × 10−5 (Figure 6 shows the regional plot). The minor allele was associated with higher plasma leptin concentrations.\n\nOur associations for this SNP are novel however, as we detected the rs607437 in the SORCS1 (sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 1) gene (p = 5.6 × 10−6) as the second top-ranked SNP in men. This gene is expressed in neurons of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus control and controls energy balance. Moreover, it has been widely studied in leptin-deficient obese mice and linked to insulin resistance and diabetes, as well as to neurodegeneration in both mice and humans. However, after adjustment for BMI, the statistical significance was attenuated. Among the top-ranked SNP after BMI adjustment in men, we detected the rs-4361832-NTRK2 (neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2) associated with plasma leptin concentration. They are consistent in humans and mice showing that the NTRK2 gene plays a critical role in the control of energy balance and obesity. Furthermore, Nkx2.1-Ntrk2-/- mice show increased blood glucose, serum insulin and leptin levels, so providing mechanistic support for our GWAS findings.\n\nIn the sex-specific GWAS in women, we did not detect these SNPs as top-ranked. The lead SNP in women was the rs3914096-CPNE4 (copine 4) (Figure 7 shows the regional plot). This gene encodes a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein involved in membrane trafficking.\n\nSome polymorphisms in the CPNE4 gene have been associated with cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The CPNE4 gene loses its significance after adjustment for BMI. However, in women, after the additional BMI adjustment, the SLIT3 gene was the second top-ranked (p = 2.05 × 10−6), supporting the gene–sex interaction results."

    "content": "Results\n\nArticles Identified\n\nThe initial database search identified 14,692 articles (Figure 1). Thirty-nine articles reported findings on the association between SNPs and total energy, carbohydrate, or fat intakes. These articles met the inclusion criteria according to the PICOS (Participants, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Study design) statement for systematic literature search (Participants: adults without severe diseases and nonpregnant or nonbreastfeeding women; Intervention: not described; Comparator: SNPs and loci; Outcome: total energy, carbohydrate, and fat intakes; Study design: all kind of studies). Twenty articles presented loci that were described only in a single study (Supplemental Table 1). SNPs that were investigated in >1 study were reviewed according to the number of articles and the analyzed SNPs.\n\nCharacteristics of Included Studies\n\nThe publication dates of articles ranged between 2000 and 2017. More than 80% of the articles (n = 32) represented cross-sectional, cohort, or case-control studies. Two postprandial studies and 5 meta-analyses were included in the current review. The sample sizes ranged from 20 to 29,480\n\nsubjects and ≤213,173 individual participants in the meta-analyses. FFQs, food records, or dietary recalls were applied for the assessment of dietary intake. However, most studies (n = 25) used FFQs. The included studies differed in terms of population characteristics such as BMI, sex distribution, disease status, and ethnicity, as well as statistical methods applied (Tables 1–3, Supplemental Table 1). Furthermore, FTO and MC4R SNPs differed in low and high LD values (Supplemental Figures 1 and 2).\n\nGene Loci and Dietary Intake\n\nIn the following, studies considering the association between the most commonly studied loci and dietary intake are presented. Figure 2 shows the overlap of significant associations between SNPs and total energy, carbohydrate, and fat intakes.\n\n FTO Locus and Dietary Intake\n\nIn total, 13 studies as well as 4 meta-analyses reported on potential associations between the FTO locus and total energy, carbohydrate, and fat intakes. Approximately 40% of these articles (n = 7) reported results on populations of European ancestry. Six publications presented data for different populations (e.g., Asian, African American, American Indian, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islanders). The sample sizes varied between 40 and 29,480 participants in observational and experimental studies and yielded 213,173 subjects in the meta-analyses. In total, 8 different FTO SNPs were investigated, whereas data for SNP rs9939609 were presented in >60% of the articles (n = 11) (Table 1).\n\nThree publications, including 2 meta-analyses, reported a significant association between the A risk allele of rs9939609 and lower total energy intake (P < 0.01). Both meta-analyses estimated a lower total energy intake of 6.4 kcal/d (unadjusted) or 5.9 kcal/d (adjusted), respectively. In contrast, other studies reported evidence of a significant association between the A risk allele with a higher total energy intake. Four articles did not find evidence for a significant association between SNP rs9939609 and total energy intake (Table 1). In addition, an association with higher total energy intake was reported for risk allele carriers of the FTO SNPs rs1421085 and rs8050136, which are in a high LD to rs9939609 (r² > 0.90), whereas Park et al. observed findings in the opposite direction in African and European Americans. The SNPs rs3751812, rs9922708, and rs1121980 showed consistently nonsignificant associations with total energy intake (Table 1).\n\nWith regard to carbohydrate intake, FTO risk allele carriers of rs9939609 consumed fewer carbohydrates [ß = –0.002% of energy (%E); P = 0.005]. Lear et al. analyzed a sample of 706 individuals of different ethnicities for associations between rs9939609 and carbohydrate intake, resulting in nonsignificant findings. However, subanalyses suggested a lower carbohydrate intake per A allele change in Aboriginal Canadians (ß = –2.2%E; P = 0.049) and a higher intake per minor A allele in participants of European descent (ß = 2.3%E; P = 0.007). Park et al. observed a significantly lower carbohydrate intake (in %E) per A allele change for the SNP rs8050136, whereas Haupt et al. did not. In a joint analysis of samples of European ancestry (n = 71,326), A allele carriers of the SNP rs10163409, which is not in LD to rs8050136, showed a significantly positive association with carbohydrate intake (ß = 0.166%E; P = 0.001). Nonsignificant results were consistently reported for the SNPs rs1421085, rs3751812, rs9922708, rs9935401, and rs1121980 and carbohydrate intake (Table 1).\n\nWith regard to fat intake, significantly positive associations between obesity-risk alleles of SNP rs9939609, rs1421085, and rs8050136 and fat intake were observed. Steemburgo et al. showed a positive association between SNP rs9939609 and fat intake as percentage of energy (P = 0.019) only for females (n = 126). McCaffery et al. confirmed this result in a subanalysis of non-Hispanic white participants, showing a nominal association between the obesity-associated minor allele of rs1421085 and greater fat intake (ß = 0.37%E; P = 0.042). Moreover, Park et al. described a significantly positive association between the FTO rs8050136 genotype and higher fat intake (Table 1). In contrast, in the meta-analysis of Livingstone et al., the FTO risk allele carriers of rs9939609 consumed less fat (P = 0.004). Chu et al. showed a significant inverse association between the SNP rs10163409 and fat intake (ß = –0.22%E; P ≤ 0.001) in a subcohort of 33,531 individuals. With regard to fat intake, nonsignificant results were consistently reported for the SNPs rs3751812, rs9922708, rs9935401, and rs1121980 (Table 1).\n\nMelanocortin 4 Receptor Locus and Dietary Intake\n\nEleven publications (8 observational studies, 1 experimental study, and 2 meta-analyses) studied associations between the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) locus and total energy, carbohydrate, and fat intakes (Table 2). Almost one-third of the articles (n = 3) included data from European populations. The remaining articles included data from mixed populations (n = 4) or nonspecified individuals (n = 4). The sample sizes varied between 40 and 29,480 individuals for observational and experimental studies and between 36,973 and 177,330 for the 2 meta-analyses. The studies reported data on 5 MC4R SNPs: rs17782313, rs17700633, rs17700144, rs2229616, and rs571312 (Table 2).\n\nMost articles (8 out of 11) investigated the MC4R SNP rs17782313, which is in high LD to rs571312 (r² = 0.96). Two of them reported a significant association between the CC genotype and a higher total energy intake (P < 0.01). For SNP rs571312, a similar significantly positive association with energy intake was reported (ß = 58.84 kcal/d; P = 0.02). Other studies, including 2 meta-analyses, did not find significant associations between MC4R SNPs and total energy intake, or for rs17782313, rs17700633, or rs2229616 (Table 2).\n\nWith regard to carbohydrate intake, a study in an Iranian population showed a significant association between SNP rs17782313 and a lower carbohydrate intake (P = 0.04 in lean subjects, P < 0.001 in overweight subjects). A study in persons with severe obesity showed that carriers of the rs2229616 variant 103I had a higher carbohydrate intake (P = 0.01). Other studies did not observe significant associations between SNPs rs17782313, rs17700633, rs571312, or rs17700144 and carbohydrate intake.\n\nWith regard to fat intake, results were nonsignificant, with 1 exception (Table 2). Only the analysis of 5724 white women, performed by Qi et al. showed a significant association between the CC genotype and a higher total fat intake in grams per day (P = 0.001). This association was no longer significant, when data were expressed as percentage of total energy intake.\n\nOther Loci and Dietary Intake\n\nThe remaining 18 loci analyzed for an association with total energy, carbohydrate, or fat intakes in >1 article are listed in Table 3. Ten cross-sectional studies and 3 meta-analyses were identified. The sample sizes varied between 118 and 71,326 participants. Data on total energy intake were available in 10 articles and data on carbohydrate and fat intakes in 11 articles.\n\nTwo studies on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) locus showed a significantly positive association between the obesity-risk alleles and total energy intake. No significant association between BDNF SNPs and total energy intake was found in the other articles. With regard to carbohydrate and fat intakes, nonsignificant findings were reported for all 7 BDNF SNPs.\n\nFor SNP rs6548238 in the transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18) locus, a significant association with fat intake (P = 0.030) in a sample of 12,462 German adults was reported for T allele carriers, which was not confirmed by other studies. Consistently, no significant associations were found between TMEM18 SNPs and total energy or carbohydrate intakes.\n\nFor the potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing 15 (KCTD15) locus, no significant associations with total energy intake were shown. However, SNP rs368794 showed a significant association with higher carbohydrate intake (P = 0.020). Studies on the SNP rs11084753, which is in LD to rs368794 (r² = 0.8) did not confirm this result. With regard to fat intake and rs11084753, Park et al. did not find any significant relation, whereas Holzapfel et al. described a significant association with a higher fat score (P = 0.03). Moreover, no significant associations were reported for rs29941 or for rs368794 and fat intake.\n\nA significant association between the neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) SNP rs2815752 and lower total energy intake (P = 0.004) was described in a Swedish cross-sectional study (n = 29,480). However, significance was lost after correction for misreporting. McCaffery et al. confirmed the significant finding in non-Hispanic white participants. This association was not confirmed by the meta-analysis of Park et al.. In the Swedish study, a significant association between rs2815752 and higher carbohydrate intake (P ≤ 0.001) was reported. This significant result was not confirmed by the other articles. With regard to fat intake, no association with NEGR1 SNPs was described, with the exception of Rukh et al. who found a significantly inverse association between the rs2815752 T allele carriers and fat intake (ß = –0.21%E; P ≤ 0.001) (Table 3).\n\nNone of the studies investigating the SH2B adaptor protein 1 (SH2B1) locus reported significant associations with total energy, carbohydrate, or fat intakes, with one exception. Bauer et al. found a significantly higher fat intake for risk G allele carriers of SNP rs7498665 (P = 0.003). The SNPs rs7647305 and rs9816226 at the ETS variant 5 (ETV5/SFRS10) locus showed no significant associations with total energy, carbohydrate, or fat intakes, except for the subanalysis of McCaffery et al..\n\nThe glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2 (GNPDA2) locus was not significantly associated with total energy, carbohydrate, or fat intakes (Table 3). Only Rukh et al. showed that the obesity-risk G allele was significantly associated (ß = –10.97 kcal/d; P = 0.039) with a lower energy intake, although this result was no longer significant after correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nTwo SNPs that were in high LD (r² = 0.81) at the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) locus were significantly associated with a higher carbohydrate intake as a percentage of energy (P < 0.001). Chu et al. presented data on fat intake and showed a significantly negative association with SNP rs838133 (ß = –0.21%E).\n\nFor the PPARG SNP rs1801282, there was no significant association with total energy or carbohydrate intakes (Table 3). However, a significantly higher fat intake was observed for Ala12 carriers compared with carriers of the Pro12 allele. Significantly positive associations were also found for the rs1761667 at the CD36 locus. Ramos-Lopez et al. presented data showing a higher intake of calories (P < 0.001) and a higher total fat intake (P < 0.001) for the AA genotype of overweight participants but not for subjects with obesity. This association was not confirmed by the study of Shen et al..\n\n No significant associations between SNPs and total energy, carbohydrate, or fat intakes were found for the other loci described in Table 3."
